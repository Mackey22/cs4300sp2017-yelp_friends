74.Caf√© Jennie,[u"Stopped in for lunch during our college visit Cornell day. Convenient location on the bookstore for those needing to get to the next activity. Nice food selection.\n\nMy son ordered a large bowl of the clam chowder for just $3.99 - a deal! I scored a taste and it was terrific. A great bowl of clam chowder; I kind of wish I'd ordered it too! \n\nI ordered the Brazilian Chicken wrap. Tasty and satisfying. My only complaint was the spring mix of lettuce in the wrap didn't cut/separate well when I bit into the wrap making for less graceful eating. ;-) Insignificant overall.  They had a nice fresh fruit salad as well which we split in addition to our meal.   \n\nSeating is limited. It was a crowded weekend and we were lucky to snag a table.\n" u"This neat little cafe is conveniently located inside the Cornell Store. It has a variety of sandwiches and pastries and serves Peet's Coffee. I love their Matcha Green Tea Javiva. It's kind of like slushy green tea ice cream smoothie. This place is usually packed throughout the day especially during lunch. Lots of students like studying here so it might be difficult to find a good seat. However this is a great place to go if you want to chat with someone. I met up with a professor here for coffee one afternoon and it was great!\n" u"This is a great option for lunch if you're visiting campus. Great made to order salads sandwiches and burritos. Lots of healthy options. The staff was really friendly too. This is a school cafeteria and you sit in a nice dining hall after going through the line.\n" u'Pricey like most food on campus. Matcha drinks are pretty good. Sandwich was also quite good considering the type of cafe.\n' u"It is above my expectation.\n\nI had an illusion that I was not sitting in a campus cafe with an amicable server taking to me my Beef Brisket Sandwich on a porcelain plate with real silverwares.\n\nThey make their sandwich so exquisite. Bread is very special crisp on the outer side soft and punky on the inner side milk/cream sweet scented different from what I have had in other caf\xe9s making me believe it is fresh handmade in store this morning. (They did claim to bake their jam filled croissants every morning in store.) Beef is tender seasoned with grilled onion and cheddar. Sided with carefully laid garden green onion and blue cheese. We all know blue cheese and beef are good match.\n\nI didn't mean to eavesdrop but the first-date couple at next table were so cute. ^_^ At least now I know American look the same as Chinese on their first date. The boy said this place was 30% overpriced which I cannot agree. Can you find a more pleasant and economic place for you very first date?\n\n$7 for a sandwich.\n" u'Thai chicken wrap is on point and the Americanos here are the best BRBs can buy on campus.\n' u"The best coffee I've had in Ithaca! It's a shame I discovered it a month before I graduated! \n\nDefinitely get their chai latte it's one of the few places that gets it right!\n" u'Green tea latte and macrons are good. Never get their sandwiches tho... People get sick from it according to what I heard\n' u"This is high quality for Cornell's campus and may be the best eatery on its grounds. Sandwiches are relatively creative in composition and actually served to your table. It may be the only place that serves Peet's coffee in Ithaca which is delicious (while the local roasteries are good it's hard not to welcome the variety). The atmosphere is fairly cozy and there are books and magazines available to browse from the surrounding Cornell Store. Downsides: it is a bit pricey compared to other Cornell dining options and I get the sense that the sandwiches aren't as good as they seemed when I first tried them - though that may just be me getting used to the taste.\n"]
7.Ithaca Gateway BBQ Kitchen,[u'Awesome little place. Brisket was fantastic! Great variety of food. A wonderful little gem in Ithaca.\n' u'Stopped in here while in Ithaca to watch a swim meet. We\'re staying at the Marriott across the street and found this place on Yelp. So far this has been the best restaurant we\'ve visited and I would recommend it especially to Marriott guests as it is sooo close. The price is also incredibly reasonable and we only spent $33 for 3 meals. While this may not be the "best" BBQ I\'ve ever had I was enjoyed it for what it was and for the $$$ you just can\'t go wrong. \n\nFriday Fish Special Dinner with mac & cheese and zucchini fries side - Only available Friday is the white fish special which you can get beer battered breaded or broiled. I highly recommend the beer battered it was perfectly light and crispy. The mac & cheese was good and I thought the zucchini fries were well done and unique.\n\nHalf Rack of Ribs - The meat was falling off the bone and the sauce was perfectly sweet and tangy. I will say that they do pre-make the ribs and heat them up upon ordering but I definitely don\'t hold that against them as I think that\'s typical for the level of business they\'re doing. \n\nBrisket Dinner with baked beans - This was definitely our least favorite. The brisket was dense and chewy. It was really lacking in juiciness and they covered it in BBQ. Good brisket you don\'t even need sauce since it\'s so tender and juicy. \n\nSpace: Really small take out spot but really well maintained. There are maybe 10 seats in there so it\'s probably better to get to go. \n\nService: Nice quick service which was nice and courteous.\n\nParking: There is parking in the back but just beware as quite a few spots are labelled reserved for apartment tenants other businesses or delivery cars.\n' u"Don't let the nondescript location fool you--this place has possibly the best bbq in Ithaca. The brisket melts in your mouth and the pulled pork has great flavor and texture. I work nearby and get the Red Crown chicken sandwich a Greek salad with chicken or a Reuben pretty often--all are fantastic! I also recommend the Zucchini fries and tater tots--they go great with their chipotle mayo or bbq dressing for dipping.\n\nMozzarella sticks are more like medallions but hit the spot--they use good mozzarella!\n\nThe burgers I've had are flavorful but a little dry--same with the mac and cheese.\n\nPortion sizes are pretty big for sandwiches and sides. Quesadillas are huge! \n\nFriendly and helpful staff and super good hours. Unfortunately closed on Mondays.\n" u'I feel bad for Ithaca if this is what "amazing" BBQ is for this town.\n\nWhile the BBQ wasn\'t awful it surely didn\'t live up to the raving reviews for us. The portions are nice and large which was nice after some long hikes in the morning. I had the pulled pork and while the flavor was good I\'m always suspicious of BBQ places that already mix a ton of sauce in with their meat- the BBQ meat should be flavorful and moist on it\'s own and I felt that mixing in the sauce was hiding dryness. I say this because the meat had a strange stringiness to it which is unlike the best BBQ places we have in FL.\n\nThe BBQ beans were good I think that was my favorite thing on my plate.\nTheir apple cole slaw was surprisingly not flavorful at all even with the addition of salt and pepper. That was a bit disappointing.\nWhat was just plain bad was the cornbread. Both dry and unflavorful it was not even worth putting on anyone\'s plate.\n\nI know it\'s a small place but the indoor seating makes no sense- with chairs put up right against the window sill there\'s no place to put your legs that is either comfortable or makes it easy to eat. \n\nThey have a huge fly problem which made eating very uncomfortable having to battle flies from landing on your food.\n\nAs a visitor I don\'t think I could in good conscious recommend this place to other visitors based off of their BBQ even though they were very friendly folks.\n' u"I got the pulled pork with Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was baked and so delicious! I would say it probably needed a tiny bit of salt but I didn't mind too much since the rest of my meal was so flavorful! The pulled pork was very tender and had a great barbecue sauce on it. It was a hefty portion so after finishing my Mac and cheese I could really only eat half of the meat! It was nice to eat the rest of it as a snack later though. The order also came with a little piece of cornbread that actually had small pieces of scallion in it. It wasn't too strong of a flavor so I really enjoyed. \n\nThey do prepare everything to order but I was confused as to why two other people's to-go orders were prepared before our to-go order was. It took a bit longer than I would've liked it to. But overall a tasty and great value meal! It was $8.25 for the pulled pork + one side.\n" u'Rotating owner/staff different menu every time you look--this place has gone way downhill. Service is extremely slow and last time I went there was someone working in the kitchen with a toddler sitting on the counter who she would pick up and move around as she worked. Stay away.\n' u"4 stars for bbq ribs and alligator gumbo. The gumbo was rich smoky and not too salty. Alligator was a little tough but I've never had tender alligator before so hard to compare. Had the combo dinner special with 1/2 rack of ribs and 1/4 bbq chicken and mac and cheese. Both entrees looked great - ribs were juicy and tender (and a little more fatty than I would have liked i.e. they could have been trimmed a little more perhaps) but very flavorful - some combo of sauce and rub. The chicken was well cooked and not dry but not juicy either. Mac and cheese had a hint of garlic - could use more but was creamy and good texture not runny. \n\nMy companion had the combo platter with ribs brisket pulled pork along with appleslaw and black eyed peas (salad) of some kind. All were just OK for her except the ribs which she enjoyed most. I though the pulled pork was good - I don't usually get pulled pork b/c it's so often dried meat drowned in sauce but that thought it was a good level of moist meat and not too much sauce. The brisket was flavorful and somehow tender enough to fall apart but a little tough when chewing. I enjoyed the flavors and freshness of the appleslaw but the blackeyed peas salad was a little mushy and didn't have much flavor despite having what looked like a good amount of chopped tomato and veggies and herbs - maybe more salt. \n\nI would definitely go back for ribs gumbo and slaw.\n" u"This review is based on my experience at the Gateway tent during Ithaca Fest. I had the most delicious BBQ pulled chicken sandwich that was made all the more appetizing because the sauce contained apple slices. Sweet touch! The sandwich was huge and I didn't think I would eat the whole thing but damn it felt good to be a gangster. I inhaled it and seeing as it was the last lunch I would eat for a month (Ramadan y'all) I am glad I ate this beautiful piece of art.\n" u"Simple little place but excellent foods and friendly genuine service.\n\nParking: \nDon't get frustrated if you don't see parking in the front. Just drive around to the back there is a huge parking lot. Park only in unreserved spots.\n\nSeating area:\nThere are only a few small tables inside.\nThere are more seats outside.\n\nFoods:\nOne of the best tasting beef briskets. Deep smokey tasting on the outside and super juicy and soft on the inside. \nColeslaw (apple-slaw) is very nicely prepared.\nBaked beans are also excellent.\n\nI will return when I come to this area again.\n" u'We first caught wind of this place during the Ithaca Chowder Fest. Their Chowder was for me hands-down the best of the bunch.\n\nWe finally had an opportunity to check them out today. Being a vegetarian I was planning on a paltry selection for me to choose from. I was delighted to find that I was wrong. \n\nI ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich and macaroni salad. They don\'t have much of a seating area (they must do most business through their deliveries) but they were very helpful and attentive.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the brisket and fried petal onions. I was actually pleased that it took a fair amount of time for the food to come out. I loathe pre-made food just sitting in a warmer waiting to be scooped out.\n\nMy "burger" was amazing. Super juicy marinade made for a delicious sloppy mess. I loved it. My boyfriend took one bite of his brisket and said "this is the barbecue place that I have always wanted Ithaca to have." The petal onion fries were yummy though I wasn\'t a fan of the dipping sauce they had.. it was kind of like a Chipotle aioli that wasn\'t *bad* per se but it didn\'t seem to fit with the rest of the meal.\n\nI\'m glad we went there it was absolutely delicious and I look forward I trying more from their menu.\n' u"Boy I'll tell ya what. When it comes to butt kickin' bar-B-Q ain't no place in these here parts that gives Gateway reason to fear. They're the undisputed kings and it'd be a cryin' shame if no one came to realize that. \n\nI rode in right before the sun began to set and my stomach was lettin' me know--loud and clear--that it wasn't gonna continue to work for free. I hear ya little stomach buddy. Now I had an inkling of what this place was seein' as I'd encountered the likes of 'em before (ya know Chowder Fest an' all that). I reckoned any half-decent chow would do and based on my previous ren-day-vous with BBQ in Ithaca let's be honest... I din't exactly have high hopes. But it's like they say: ask a horse to trot and smile when he gallops. As soon as that food came out I could tell my prayers were answered (and if you ain't prayin' fer good BBQ the hell you prayin' fer?).\n\nI'll be straight with ya: the brisket was tender moist fallin' apart at the seams and smothered in a sweet tangy sauce. (By the way some other yahoo down below complained about his brisket fallin' apart. Complained. I swear what's this world comin' to when they let heretics like that write anythin' they want?) Anywho the sides were just right and I gotta be extra clear on this: the cornbread was the real McCoy. I mean to say it was obviously from scratch baked in with herbs and corn kernels not like them boxed squares that try to pull a fast one on my tastebuds. Hat's off to you Gateway for doin' a hard day's work of cookin' the way it was meant to be done.\n\nNow here's the thing: Gateway's a small place in a less-than-hoppin' part of town. That's alright with me and it don't amount to nothin' in terms of their quality. But I reckon it don't do much for their publicity so I'm declarin' my intentions to go back and I suggest you do the same.\n" u"I ordered a few items from here and they satisfied the barbecue craving I had but I wasn't particularly impressed.\nPulled pork bbq: The sauce was tasty but there was too much of it and the pork was extremely shredded. It was okay but I like Maxie's pulled pork more.\nMac and cheese: It was okay but didn't have any strong flavors and needed some salt.\nBaked beans: Tasted like baked beans should.\nCornbread: Was slightly dry but some salted butter made it much better (no surprise there I guess).\nFries: The fries were really good and I liked the seasoning used in the beer batter.\n" u"I'm from Syracuse New York and I'm working in Ithaca this place is a little gemlove there food.I would like to see it on one of the cooking shows maybe with Guy Furei\n" u"Great bbq pull pork good cornbread that is free with purchase of bbq. May I suggest trying combo 1/2 of chicken since that's real large portion and most of sides are really delicious and I actually order their sample platter ( actually receive 3 choices of meat) with order I ordered: gateway bbq chicken bbq pulled pork and bbq chicken that's an large leg for dark meat lover also parking and seating very limited don't be surprised because crowded.\n" u'Could go only once. Half BBQ Chicken with 2 sides. Chicken - allrite smoky mahogany skin little tough more than serviceable when a craving hits. The review is for the sides - knocked my socks off. Just a slaw with green apple mixed in and probably best pickle chips this side of Miss. - vinegary sweet spicy peppery. Thus felt obliged to leave a review. Cheers.\n' u'The brisket and pulled pork sandwich were awesome. Will definitely return if my son ends up attending Cornell.\n' u'This place is Dynamite! My food was delivered within the hour and still warm. We ordered The Cuban sandwich which was absolutely delicious the chicken sandwich onion petals zucchini fries pork sliders and macaroni salad. All of which were so flavorful and made with so much love and quality ingredients.  I love BBQ sauce and theres was perfect. I am so thrilled to have chosen to order food from here. Keep up the great work!!!\n' u'Excellent bbq. Ribs and brisket were top notch. Loved the apple slaw (wow) and mac and cheese sides. Limited seating but super nice guys who set up a table for us. Highly recommend. Only disappointed by the corn bread.\n' u'Amazing pulled pork mac and cheese and cornbread! The poor guy behind the counter was the only one working the night I went and there were several customers ahead of me and the phone kept ringing for call in orders. Although there was a bit of a wait it was worth it as the food was excellent! Not much seating but they do have several tables outside.\n' u'Simple decor a few tables but the barbecue is delicious. I highly recommend the brisket and the salted potatoes.\n']
93.Italian Carry Out,[u'This place has in my opinion the best wings in Ithaca! Their pizza is also mouth-watering. They are realistic on their wait times when you call in an order and the service is incredibly friendly and welcoming.\n\nWe come here at least once a week and will continue to do so. They are our go-to pizza place!\n' u"Crummy dreary overpriced little place in a muddy parking lot.  Stayed at the hotel next door and ordered here twice - two more times than I should have.  Tasteless cold subs.  Watery ketchupy tomato sauce.  Garden salad had one tiny plum tomato and two onion slices.  The rest was lettuce.  Ask for plastic utensils or you're out of luck.  This may work for college kids but anyone who knows their stuff would know better and avoid this hole.\n" u'Great place for Pizza and Calzones. The pricing is reasonable and they deliver what more could you ask for. We also sampled the chicken parm platter that was huge with pasta and a salad. Almost right across the street from Ithaca college. We will be back.\n' u'I\'m sorry I don\'t live in Ithaca. ..This place  epitomizes the " shop small"  ad age.  Great Customer service...you can tell it\'s family run cause they care and know how to do bussiness.  I also walked in the cafe next door and admired that as well but will try tommorrow. ..great meatball parm..tommorrow will try canzone or white pie. If tour in town for college (Ithaca)  make a left and go up the hill a block instead of down...\n' u"I was reluctant at first because of the look of the place and the totally boring name. But I'll tell you what I was so excited about this pizza that I had to write this immediately. In fact I'm eating their pizza as i write this and it is amazing. I didn't give this five stars because quite frankly I'm a pizza snob and it isn't quite as good as say classic trenton style like DeLorenzo's tomato pie in Robinsville NJ which will make your head explode. So it isn't quite as good as that because it' totally different but I have been living in Ithaca for over a year and I have been trying desperately to find awesome pizza and I've finally found it. Their sauce is on top which for some reason I think makes the texture very crispy on the outside but soft and gooey on the inside. I had a reg pizza with sausage and fresh mushrooms and all their ingredients seem quality and good especially their sauce. Honestly it really reminds me of that really good pizza that you would find on a beach boardwalk that you go to every year when you go to the ocean. \n\nFor Ithaca I'm giving it five stars but overall I'm giving it 4 stars just because I've had better pizza one time or another in my life. I recommend the pizza and the ICO fries. Don't pass this place up if you're in Ithaca and want pizza!\n" u"great little joint we had a fabulous greek salad and an order of wings for lunch yesterday.  friendliest bunch of people you can imagine.  guys you lost one star - i'd have given you five - because no one behind the counter was wearing head gear yet i saw plenty of long hair fortunately no hair found its way into our food.  mind your health practices!\n" u'Right down the road from Ithaca College (IC) lies a little Ithaca gem. The people there are very service oriented and friendly. The pizza is crunchy when you get it with eggplant. They make fresh food salads etc. My family and I go up there often. \n\nIn the summer you can sit outside. The prices and value are outstanding.\nUnlimited soft Drinks come with the food!\n' u'I always hear about this place but never got a chance to visit until this year. After my first visit I could not stop ordering from ICO. I love everything on the menu but so far my favorite is the Flying Squirrel hot sub. With chicken and philly cheesesteak on fresh bread its just too good to be true. Compared to other pizza places in Ithaca you can choose your own sauces their blue cheese is homemade and you feel like family when you go here as the Salino family is welcoming and always get to know their customers.\n' u'I love this place I go about 3 times a week sometimes twice a day to eat. All the food here is great and they have really good lunch specials every day on pizza. They have the best pizza in ithaca for sure and have good subs as well. The people are always nice and say hi and thank you every time you come and go.\n' u'Used ICO for a Italian dinner for 75 people at out hotel. WOW!! Food was outstanding and plenty of it! Great homemade ravioli penne garlic bread salad and roast beef. The team loved it and will definitely use them again  highly recommend this family run restaurant...thank you so much!\n' u"It is easy to miss this jewel tucked away discretely on the side of the road.  Don't let the decor fool you this place is family run and run right.  Come here for the pizza and leave with a smile on your face.  Order a slice trust me you won't need two.  The slices are quarter pizzas themselves and a steal at two bucks a piece!  Order the pepperoni and you won't be disappointed it is covered!  And if you eat in the fountain soda is free!\n"]
6.Istanbul Turkish Kitchen,[u'I love as the food snobs on here would say "ethnic" foods. Don\'t get me wrong burgers and fries are great but there\'s something about going to a restaurant where you don\'t know how to pronounce everything and you\'re unsure of what exactly it is...but when it comes out....it taste phenomenal. I\'ve been to this restaurant a few times now and I typically go for the Adana Kebab or the Yaprak Doner Kebab. Both are great either way. They\'re both lamb but the way they\'re prepared and served is a little different. I would also highly recommend getting a Turkish soda I tried the pomegranate flavor and I loved it! \n\nThe service can be a little slow but don\'t let that deter you from trying what they have to offer.\n' u'Came for lunch on a random Wednesday. Decent space that was quite deceiving from the outside since it is in a strip mall. \n\nFood was decent sized portions tasty with layers of depth. Lunch menu has a main meal and a complimentary lentil soup. We order two appetizers and two meals. \n\nService was bit slow since there was only 1 server for about 8 tables but overall I thought the food shined. The place had a bit of traffic for being out of the way from the commons. Place was clean.\n' u'The best meal I have had in Ithaca in a very long time. Absolutely delicious food. The restaurant itself is very clean and we had great service.\n' u'Very good cooking is happening at this Turkish restaurant delicate and tasty dishes with a strong vegetables taste that is difficult to find.  They even pass the eggplant proper cooking test which is rare in this country.\n\nThe portions can be larger though especially for the desserts.\n' u"A little more Westernized cuisine than authentic but I would definitely come here again. I'm always on the hunt for authentic Turkish food-- this food consoles but probably isn't mind-blowing.\n" u'Delicious food. Tables are a bit uncomfortably close to each other but the atmosphere is pretty nonetheless. \n\nThe waitress was incredibly nice to our table but a bit rude to the group of boys next to us for not knowing that you couldn\'t put more than two cards on one bill which I would not have known either. \n\nThe meat is cooked well and the vegetables are delicious. The "marinara sauce" has a bit of a kick to make the food a bit more interesting. All the veggies on the side were super yummy as well. Simple but good. \n\nThe desserts all looked amazing but we only tried the Baklava which was delicious. \n\nAnd in case you\'ve never had Turkish coffee before yes 1/3 of the cup is just pure coffee grounds. Try your best not to swallow any of that. Pretty gross.\n' u"Service was terrible if I'm being generous. We got a table after waiting for 20 minutes despite empty tables clearly visible.\n\nThe host was too snobby and deliberately ignored my concerns\nIs it too much to ask for spoons and forks to eat my food with? We had the graduation menu(there was no other choice)\n\nIt took almost half an hour for our food which was......drumroll.......mediocre. If you want real authentic turkish food try the Mediterranean and Turkish food restaurant in Framingham MA. \n\nThe chicken was burnt in one dish and dipped in store bought Marinara in another. Not exactly bad but if I'm waiting for half hour I expect nicer food. The dessert was good have to give then that.\n\nUnlikely that i'll ever visit Ithaca again but if I do not coming back here.\n" u'Wow! Worth the drive and very tasty dishes.  We got rice pudding and Turkish delight for desert.  Both fantastic and not overly sweet.  DH and I both got Donnar Kebabs and we both asked for no tomato on our plates.  Both came with them anyway.  Also the appetizer that said it was lightly fried looked like stew and was ice cold so something off about the description.  But it was really yummy!  Everything was spiced so nicely not hot just so delicious!!  The prices were also quite good.\n' u'Came here because of its good Yelp reviews and was thoroughly disappointed. \n\nOrdered food to go and not only was everything soggy and sloppily packed in *paper* boxes (imagine putting eggplant pur\xe9e in a paper box - see the photos) they forgot an entire entree that we had ordered and paid for. We only ordered 3 appetizers and 3 entrees for reference not a "big" order for a major mistake like that to happen. Not very helpful when we called back no offer to deliver the missing entree or refund our money. \n\nPlus Portions are small considering the price.\n' u'Excellent food....loved the Eggplant dishes.... Zucchini Eggplant pancake did it for me.... Will definitely go back to eat again\n' u"Visiting Ithaca and disappointed at the offering for food at the Farmer's market we went here for lunch and were pleasantly surprised! Sitting in the middle of a non-descript strip mall across from a section-8 housing complex it doesn't look like much from the outside. We both had kebabs salad and Turkish tea. Food was good service was good and the price was good. Next time we're in town we may even try this place for dinner.\n" u"This was a great find after a long day in Ithaca. Located in a strip mall didn't expect to find such high quality Turkish food. Wasn't super crowded on a week night and we were seated promptly. Brought our own drinks as its BYOB without a corking fee which is a plus. We got the Adana kebab (mix of beef and lamb) which was delicious and spicy. Came with lots of fresh seasoned veggies which complemented the meal perfectly. We wanted to try the doner kebab but the kitchen was apparently experimenting that night and substituting chicken for the lamb. Chicken was okay but a little dry. Feel like the lamb would have been much tastier based on their Adana kebab. Otherwise a great meal highly recommend.\n" u'Quiet atmosphere.. Presentation is authentic and consistent. Food taste great . Customer service is very welcoming....as the attendants are soft spoken and friendly.\n' u"I have not had Turkish food but if this is it I'll take it. I love that their website has pictures of the food options along with descriptions. Although it doesn't seem like all the menu options are online.\n\nWe tasted mucver the doughy zuchinni pancakes were tender and hearty. Eggplant chunks and yogurt was tangy the blended eggplant dip was smoky and great for dipping. The herbed olive oil and olives that are graciously supplied to each table were also really flavorful. \n\nMain plate was doner kebab the meat was seasoned well and the accompanying carrot salad and pickled cabbage were a zesty lightly spiced whallop. I would definitely come here again. It was probably the best food I had in Ithaca during the week I spent there.\n" u"I got the Adana kebab! The food is amazing! The lamb was roasted really well and spiced perfectly. I also got the apricot nectar which was delicious. The only reason why I didn't give 5/5 is because the entrees are priced pretty high for how much food you get. The atmosphere is really nice though the decor was beautiful and the service was prompt. I spent $21 for the Adana kebab and the apricot nectar.\n" u"Great food. Thought I would try something new and glad I did. Although I wouldn't want to butcher the names of the dishes they were all great!\n" u"I came in with party of four and we ordered different dishes. None of us was really happy about the food. I ordered a trout. It was soaked in oil overcooked and had absolutely no seasoning on it. I wonder how can you spoil trout so bad and why would you deep fry the fish? My white bean salad was also tasteless. My husband's salad with feta had rediculously tiny amount of cheese. Lamb on his entree was cooked good howerer it was garnished with disgusting tomato sauce and was served with tasteless eggplant puree. Even turkish tea wasn't strong enough. On top of everything the server stank horribly with sweat and service was bad. We didn't enjoy our dinner and we will never come back.\n" u'I was really happy with this place and recommend it to anyone searching for an interesting dinner spot in Ithaca. \n\nWe ordered the meze platter to get a general idea of the menu. My daughter and I shared a shrimp dish that we were both really happy with and my husband got a kebab meal with a variety of sides. The portions are very large so we all had leftovers for lunch the next day. I definitely recommend trying the Turkish coffee. It is very strong and rounded out the meal nicely. Everything was fresh healthy and perfectly prepared. The stuffed grape leaves in particular were delicious.\n\nThe service was just okay but it was a busy evening.\n' u"I love this place and go every chance I can! if i am in Ithaca than I try and make a stop here! I love the food and have been for lunch and dinner! The portions are large and filling. The meats are tender and juicy. The bread and feta are always fresh! Both lunch and dinner offerings are similar in which one offers bread and the other offers rice pilaf or bulgar. You can't go wrong! They also offer authentic Turkish sweets and beverages. The prices are reasonable too for the amount of food you get! The place gets packed quickly but the staff are friendly amd fast at gettinf you seated and with a menu. Must try the house soup which is so flavorful and hearty perfect on a nasty snowy or rainy day. Definitely worth stopping in and trying you will love it!\n" u'Do I like Turkish food? Yes. Would I pay money for a nice sit down Turkish restaurant? Yes. Would I recommend this restaurant to family and friends? Depends. \n\nGo somewhere else with better service. \n\nThis restaurant was a gamble. It was hard to know what items on the menu were right for me. When I asked their hostesses which dishes they would recommend they said all dishes would be right for me. She gave us vague descriptions of the dishes; their explanations did not do justice for the actual dish at all. \n\nWe started of with appetizers. They were okay. Unfortunately the portion size of these only could feed a small baby. After appetizers our main entrees were brought out 1 hour later. AN ENTIRE HOUR. The wait for our food was just ridiculous. When we asked a host for the ETA on our meal he was clueless in the status. \n\nJust when we were about to call for a check and leave the restaurant our food was finally brought out. Again the portion sizes were disappointing. The food tasted decent however was not filling whatsoever. \n\nWould not recommend to large family or friend groups. Go somewhere else with better service.\n']
27.Dolce Delight,[u"Second time I'm here and specifically sought out to support a local woman-owned business on Women's Day.  Dolce Delight is mother and daughter run and I had met the daughter Christina who served and made my breakfast.  A breakfast croissant with egg cheddar spinach and mayo.  Second time I've had this first time with feta instead of cheddar and both deliciously hit the spot.  I have also had two of their pastries a cinnamon roll and I can't remember the other one both wonderfully tasty.\n\nIt's a small cafe and can get packed rather quickly so be prepared for that.\n" u'I\'ve stopped in a few times and will definitely return. \nThe chocolate banana muffins were wonderful enough that one of my companions returned to bring some home with her. (Not the overly sweet sort that most places serve.) We had another muffin (apple cinnamon?) which was good although didn\'t impress us quite as much. \nMy mac and cheese fan gave Dolce\'s high marks -- enough to repeat the same meal on a return visit. (Crumbs on top would have turned it into perfection.) The hot chocolate also got a big thumbs up. \nI\'ve had two soups (chicken tortilla and broccoli cheddar) both of which I enjoyed. Not an "OMG that was amazing" but as someone who\'s very picky about soups (I don\'t like canned varieties and find many "homemade" versions to be way too salty) it\'s pretty impressive that I enjoyed them at all. One of my companions had a tomato ravioli soup and said that the ravioli were a bit over-cooked (perhaps from sitting in the soup rather than being kept separate until serving?)\nDue to the rave reviews I had the chipotle biscuit as a side to the tortilla soup and thought it was just ok but I\'m not a huge biscuit fan so I\'d definitely suggest giving it a try and deciding for yourself. \nCafe latte was very good. As with the hot chocolate it\'s served in a nice mug. \nThe one negative (aside from very limited seating) was the day I went to get a grilled cheese to go. The sandwich itself was very good version of the standard white bread and white American cheese variety  but it it took almost 30 minutes as the griddle is small so only a few sandwiches fit at one time. (I watched them do one sandwich after another and kept thinking "that must be mine!" but it seems the facilities aren\'t sufficient to keep up with the demand during busier hours.) If they could get a bigger griddle I\'d love to see what they could do with a wider variety of "gourmet" grilled cheese options.\n' u"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. I'd be happy to have a place like Dolce in my neighborhood. There are tons of menu options and everything sounds amazing. \n\nI had a Louie bagel which was an exceptional everything bagel with egg tomato provolone and a delicious artichoke pesto. It's worth a day full of poppy seeds and garlic breath. So good.\n\nThe only criticism I have is about general appearance. It's homey and comfortable but there are a few glaring cleanliness issues that should be addressed. (Stained ceiling tiles dead bugs in the florescent lights.) But it's not my home. Everyone is free to keep their home however they want. \n\nAmazing food. Great service. Couldn't ask for a better start to my day.\n" u"I grew up in a family of good cooks and good bakers and I'm pretty sure I can taste food made with lousy or artificial ingredients a mile away.  Most pastries and baked goods in the Ithaca area do not impress me (and often aren't even worth eating).  But Dolce Delight is an exception!  This place is fabulous and the food tastes the way it should (when it's made with good ingredients and old fashioned effort).  \n\nThis place also has some really interesting breakfast sandwiches that are phenomenal and pair flavors I would never have thought to pair.\n\nIn addition Dolce catered a dessert spread for our wedding.  It was a HUGE success - the almond cookies evaporated and even the elderly relatives were getting extra slices of cake.\n" u"Our first visit to Ithaca.  This place was near our hotel and we like supporting small family-run businesses so stopped in for breakfast.  So glad we did.\n\nTons of menu options and lot's of home made goodies (including candy muffins etc.).  My wife and I were just looking for bagel sandwiches and they were tremendous.  But they had so many other choices.  Nice quaint place with pleasant warm and quick service.  If I have a complaint it's minor - they could use a few more tables and chairs (tho not sure where they would put  them) and parking might be challenging on a really busy (it wasn't for us but we were there on a late Wednesday morning - probably not a peak time).\n\nAmazing food. Great service. Nice way to start our day.\n" u'Awesome menu and breakfast sandwiches very unique and exotic creations. Highly recommended.\n' u'By far the best breakfast sandwich in a long long time! I was pleasantly surprised by this location and the cost is low and the ingredients were fresh! Keeper\n' u"We're not from Ithaca so we relied on Yelp for some research. The other reviews were excellent and we liked the menu. My wife had the Harvest salad and Blueberry Muffin. I had the Bacon      quiche and a Chipotle Biscuit. Everything was excellent. I also got another Chipotle Biscuit    and a Croissant to. \n\nIt's clean small & cozy like the other reviews state and everyone is helpful. Unfortunately they're not in Syracuse.\n" u'Love love LOVE this place! The chipotle biscuits and green dream smoothie are amazing. This is my favorite breakfast spot in Ithaca hands down. They also have a really good variety of delicious sweets definitely the best place to get cupcakes in Ithaca.\n' u'Always friendly! :-D\n\nAmazing chocolate truffles and delicious cupcakes good pies bagels sandwiches salads Purity ice cream smoothies coffee. Soy milk available for lattes. \n\nIndoor & outdoor seating. Cute cozy coffee shop feel. \n\nI only wish they had loaves of bread I could pick up to go with dinner!\n' u'Maria did an absolute fantastic job in providing 18 pies & 80 cannolis for our wedding on October 8th.  In fact they were so good that we had absolutely none left the next day!!! Highly recommend her and her delicious desserts for any occasion.\n' u"This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Ithaca. Hard to find as it's far from downtown and up the hill past IC but a lovely little cafe. There are a lot of regulars and in the mornings it can be pretty busy but they have a good amount of seating. The servers are friendly and the food is delicious - my favorite is the Veggie Delight on an everything bagel. There's a sizable menu that you can usually customize and most days a large selection of fresh pastries - the cinnamon rolls are amazing and I highly recommend. If you live in the area or are visiting I would definitely stop by for breakfast brunch or lunch - you won't regret it.\n" u'Hidden from the downtown commons scene Dolce is the perfect breakfast gem even for the most elite breakfast and brunch divas ! Bakery and breakfast spot is one of the most quaint locations in Ithaca. All sandwiches are hand made right in front of you. You MUST try to Dolce Special and add guacamole!! And if you must alter the perfect breakfast sandwich KEEP THE CHIPOTLE BISCUT!!! This is a perfect place to get sweets as gifts. The employees and owners are always so kind happy and bubbly. This spot is a perfect treat for every morning!!\n' u'Amazing breakfast bagels/biscuits and smoothies. Nice people. Soup was pretty good. Loved it!\n' u'Very small family owned deli.  Got the chipotle biscuit and ham. Very good and fresh. Got a blueberry muffin that was good.  Not too sweet which is a good thing.\n' u"Delicious breakfast sandwiches and good coffee. Didn't get to try their pastries or truffles but they look amazing!\n" u"This little coffee shop/cafe/bakery is just south of Ithaca on rte 96B about 1/4 mile from La Tourelle where i was staying. Almost across from Ithaca College. My first visit I got an egg sandwich on a bagel with guacamole swiss and kale (about $5). It was delicious!! I still had time to kill so I had a latte (?) and a large cookie ($2) They recommended the peanut butter chocolate chip. Wonderful! Also got a ginger snap for my daughter. Also yummy. \n\nWent back this morning for breakfast. I got a veggie egg bagel and daughter got a cinnamon roll. They bring the food to your table which is nicer than calling out your name and coffee in nice cup. The cinnamon roll wasn't heated so asked them to warm it. It had plenty of frosting which had cinnamon in it making it special tasting. The pies looked amazing. Lots of other baked goods. Chipotle cheddar biscuits looked interesting.  Also higher end chocolates. \n\nCute decor. Old fashioned cafe tables and odds and ends of retail items. Cookbooks handmade mugs dish clothes aprons and such. Some outside seating.\n" u'Sometimes the ratings in Yelp can be overstated. Not this time.  This place is as good if not better than all the 5 star reviews.  Had a bacon egg and cheese on bagel.  It was done perfectly.  The bagel was ultra fresh and had great texture.  Could leave without trying a raspberry muffin as well.  Extraordinary!  Not too hard to find if you are looking- at the corner of Danby (96) and King street at the traffic light.\n' u'There might be crack in the chipotle biscuits !! Tasty home made baked goods...quality meats and cheeses all done up healthy\n' u'Dolce special (swap ham for sausage) Best breakfast sandwich Ithaca has to offer. You will not be disappointed.\n']
171.Amit Bhatia Libe Caf√©,[u'The coffee is meh the food is pretty disgusting to be honest. I recommend you to just walk to college town and get food.\n']
139.Max‚Äôs Classic American Grill & Sports Bar,[u"My husband and I stopped in for a few beers before going to sleep at Hotel Ithaca. \n\nThe bartender was extremely friendly and was nice enough to put a baseball game on the TV for us. Place was quiet for a Saturday night but that's what we were in the mood for so it was perfect. \n\nWe didn't have any food so can't make any comments there but there was a nice selection of beer including some Ithaca beer selections on tap.\n" u"after checking in around 10 pm we were hungry and went to max's grill in the hotel.\nThey had a few tv's on with different games on. The only thing the bar offered at this hour was appetizers. That was ok with us since the menu had a lot to offer. We ordered wings boom boom shrimp mozzarella stickscalamari. I liked these dishes and the bartender told me about the local brew in stock.Good size menu and beer selection.   Typical hotel bar-grill but nice if you don't want to venture out. go for it. nice music and a good vibe.\n" u'DO NOT make a special trip here brcause its a "Sports Bar"... There are 2 TVs neither of which have sound.  There have got to be real sportsbars in this town.  Foods good prices and service are good but as a sports bar its kind of a joke.\n' u"When traveling there's not much more you need than sports beer and simple food.  At Max's you can get all those things and they do it fairly well.  We chose to eat here since it was nestled in our hotel.\n\nThere's a pretty good selection of beers and the local Ithaca brews are either on tap or in bottles.  I can recommend the burgers here particularly the cajun one.  We also had brunch here the next day and my omelette was good too.  Everything is affordable but not dirt cheap.\n\nAs a sports bar though its a little lacking.  If you're sitting at the bar itself you can chose from multiple games to watch.  However if you're seated at a table of booth you might not be able to see a TV at all.  I had to run over to the bar after finishing my burger to catch the end of a game.\n\nThe service was also sub-par.  Our waitress was very nice but she kept forgetting about us and it wasn't busy.  It took us quite a while to get our food and we never got an appetizer.  Luckily the food was worth the wait.  The next day at brunch though everything went smoothly.\n\nIf you're in downtown Ithaca particularly at the Holiday Inn Max's is a safe choice. You're not going to be impressed but you will leave satisfied.\n" u'Our visit started off well with some cool cars for the kids but it quickly went downhill.  We went for a quick breakfast but there was nothing quick about it thanks to the one waitress serving ALL the tables.  From the overcooked eggs benedict to the undercooked omelette it was two thumbs down all around.  Luckily kids eat free hence the one star.\n' u'Basic food at a reasonable price. The service was fine. They are open even on most holidays\n' u"I ate at Max's Classic American Grill & Sports Bar for the first and last time. The food was tasteless and part of it came out cold. I had the Tuscan Chicken. The spinach seemed like it was taken out of a can and just thrown on top of the chicken. My wife didn't like her scallops pasta either. Don't waste your time or hard-earned money going to this place for dinner.\n" u'Slow to notice us no greeting as we walked in. We had to ask for a table. Hard to find waitress. Slooooow to take order. Brought us the wrong order. Ran out of decaf pitchers even though there were only a few tables seated. Food was serviceable but the servers seemeddepressed and were depressing.\n' u"This is pretty nice as sports bars go. It's clean there are TVs for every angle and they have a pretty extensive menu featuring your normal pub grub. My only complaint is that the TVs were so loud I couldn't even have a conversation which is not so cool with me. If you want to catch a specific game however it would probably be a good place to go.\n"]
156.Sammy‚Äôs Pizzeria,[u'The rice bowl here is very good. They also have a great pizza : Chipotle chicken pizza. Its a must visit. Order can take long especially during the afternoon as they seem understaffed\n' u'Their pizza was mhm so good! That cheese just melting and the crust and everything was an awesome experience!\n' u'Pizza Pizza!. Made me remember i was still in New York... good pizza with a crisp bottom crust.\n\ncheck it out late night in the commons nice n crisp.\n' u'I was looking for some quality late evening food and stumbled up on Sammy\'s.  Did a quick Yelp check and wasn\'t very encouraged about Sammy\'s.  However my experience is that Ithaca has some harsh reviewers and perhaps they may not know a good thing when they taste one; so we decided to try Sammy\'s anyhow.\n\nThey say "You never get a second chance to make a first impression."  Well Sammy\'s didn\'t need a second chance with me!  From the very start the sassy countergirl was very helpful friendly and patient with us--she offered her opinions and suggestions on what we may enjoy.  There were so many choices of gourmet slices in the windowed display.  This late night joint was also touting their fried chicken plus sides.  \n\nHaving a ravenous appetite and needing to make yet another Yelp review while on the road we ordered a couple of slices a small bucket of fried chicken with side orders of mac\'n\'cheese and a 2 liter of root beer thrown in. \n\nThe high point was definitely the pizza.  Since the slices are double baked you get a nice crisp crust that you wouldn\'t get on a single bake.  The chicken was "meh" good enough if you are feening for some chicken but a pass if you have to make a choice.  The mac\'n\'cheese was very oooey gooey; pasta was firm and not too mushy; taste was average.\n\nAtmosphere is typical for a collegetown greasy spoon opened late night.  Tables weren\'t the cleanest probably because students are animals when drunk.\n\nWhat was most memorable again was the warm welcome and assistance by their order-taker...who made the experience an extra notch upwards.\n' u'Pretty yummy I will say. Though I am a fan of thin crust this was definitely decent pizza!\n' u'Great pizza and really cheap. Staff is pretty nice. Definitely the best pizza in collegetown for the price.\n' u'Delivery takes over an hour and a half. Pizza shows up cold and the staff is incredibly rude and have no desire to work there. Try any pizza place other than Sammys. Be prepared to be hung up on if you call to complain. \n\n"Don\'t order from us next time then" - direct quote from the driver.\n' u'Extremely deceptive pricing. They covered up the prices for combo meals while only revealing the combo meal numbers for ordering.\n' u"This is a mediocre as best pizza place in the commons. Don't go out of your way to stop by but not bad if you want a slice and are already in the commons. \n\nTwo stars only because they bribe other people with pizza to leave reviews on Yelp.\n" u"We often come up here to see our son who goes to school here and always make time for Sammy's. The portions are more than generous. I personally cannot get enough of their wings. The salads  sandwiches and calzones are all worth trying. It is usually full of college kids but we can still find a spot in one of the booths. The place is super casual ..as you would expect of a collegetown pizzeria but the food is great.\n" u"Ordered a few slices for delivery and they never showed up.\n\nShortly after ordering a nice young lady called us and said that they were out of one of the slices we ordered and we were able to swap it for another.\n\nBut then it never came.\n\nWe called two hours later and they were extremely rude. They basically told us that they didn't know what happened to our order.\n\nAll things considered it looks like we dodged a bullet.  There are a few good reviews but it seems like this place doesn't make a great slice. \n\nWould not recommend.\n" u"The good: Thin & crispy crust good flavor. Friendly folks. \n\nThe not-so-good:  Pizza is on the greasy side. Dark interior kinda run-down. If you're going to eat here I recommend sitting out on the commons.\n" u'I was looking for a place nearby Cornell for some Halal food options so far could find only this place which says Halal chicken pizza wings etc. Bought a medium pizza and wings deal for ~$20. Price and taste is good. They offer some combo deals which sounds better.\n' u'Pizza was ok. My problem here was two fold. I originally planned to eat at the Mexican place down the street but didn\'t want to wait half an hour for a table. Decided to stop in here for quick slices from the place that serves the "best pizza in Ithaca."  Most of the slices on display looked overcooked so I settled on a slice of plain and a slice of their fresh tomato laden Margherita pizza. My wife ordered a slice of plain and a slice of Sicilian. We got our sodas and took a seat. Ten minutes went by and nothing. Five more minutes and a guy walks over asking if we ordered a broccoli pizza.  Not us. I went to the counter and watched someone else put in an order and then the guy at the counter asked if he could help me. I told him about the four slices we ordered 25 minutes earlier which he only then discovered burnt to a crisp in the lower oven. They put in four new slices but only had one plain slice left so I settled on a second slice of their average Margherita. Either Ithaca has sub par pizza or this is just not truth in advertising. The guy offered a soda to make it right but we already had them. Should have waited for a seat at the Mexican place instead. \n\nAlso I didn\'t mind but I\'m sure the family with the two little kids wasn\'t too happy about the South Park episode of Oprah Winfrey\'s vagina and a-hole holding up a bank blaring in the background and on the two TVs while dining. I was embarrassed for them and for the mother who kept telling her kids those were bad words that they were saying on TV.\n' u"They don't have anything but cheese pizza after 1:19am. I need my buffalo. The place is full of college students. Don't come here if you have family. Perfect place while visit your child at Cornell or Ithaca College.\n" u'This place has the cheapest Pizza in Ithaca and at one time was A-OK -- the crust was just the right combination of chewy and crunchy but I feel the quality has gone down hill especially the quality of the cheese. The sauce is also a bit too sweet for my taste. \n\nI think a sign on the bathroom says it all about where this restaurant is going\n\n"Our aim is to keep this bathroom clean -- Gentlemen your aim will help. Stand closer; It\'s shorter than you think. Ladies -- Please remain seated for the entire performance"\n' u"They have halal chicken on subs and pizza that's more then I could ever wish for. Definitely try out the Chicken Kebab Subs!\n" u"Do not under any circumstances order delivery from here. It took over two hours to arrive (an hour longer than it was supposed to) and the food was horrible. I ordered a pizza (which never even arrived) a salad (not that fresh) mozzarella sticks (literally empty no cheese) and a chix parm sandwich (marginal). On the plus side they issued a refund and we still got our food. Of which we barely ate anything since it was not that great and arrived very late in the evening. Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe our experience.\n" u"Do the staffs served all customer with 30 waiting when all the restaurant is empty on the Ithaca festival day and I missed the festival without explanation? Fried chicken with no any sauce?\n \nI wrote review for them before and gave them 5 star with thought that they had a great reputation great service great food and so on you can read it below this latest review. Now I changed. I am very disappointed with this restaurant. And will never go back.\n\nThe latest time I went there was on Saturday of Ithaca Festival Week in 2015. I would like to find something to eat fast and quick serve. Because I was very hungry I did not eat anything all day from 6 am in the morning - until 6 pm in the evening I just drink water all day because I try to loose weight. I just get out of work and would like to grabbed something fast to eat. I join the festival just a bit and then hungry then I headed to pizza restaurant. Cashier the teen girl took my order with 2-3 pieces of chicken coslaws and mashed potato. Restaurant is empty just me and 1 guy sitting at the front. I think it was only my order or 1 more order on line. And I have to wait for 30 minute for just couple pieces of chicken. And I am not understand that. No explained from any staffs from start to finished and they served my fried chicken with no sauce at all. Really? No catchup or anything? I remembered last time they served me though? Confusing or no consistant.\n\nNo communicate no sorry and no explanation nothing from the restaurant and then that is it for me. I am no going back. If they honest to customer and told me before I order that this order is  will take long then I can choose other restaurant else we have 40 restaurants in downtown though. And it was too many inappropriate service from them though. And I am not deserved this kind of service too. I did not know it will take this long and I gave them 1 dollar tip too. I order soda too and she don't even gave me a cup. I have to asked her for that. Enough is enough.\n\nAbout an hour that I wasted time with them. I missed a lot of opportunity missed many concert (3  main staged and so on) and by the time I finished eating and started to walked with the crowned is too late getting dark and many shopped along the way were closed their tent already. Sadly. Poorly choose the wrong choice. The staffs did not understand customer that that exact time customer supposed to joined the festival and they hurried. \n\nCouple day before on the Thursday of parade day I have dinner at Taste of Thai downtown the Thai restaurant that located opposite from Sammy just across the street I went there by 4 pm they served me quick even dinner because they understand the situation in case customer will go to join the parade (about 3 minute waiting for the meal and I order Rad na) That was very impressed. And I make the wrong choice to choose Sammy. And it will be my last time to be their customer. I am too disappointed and too many pizza restaurant choices in town so I would like to say bye to them. I can choose not to been there and be customer at the rest pizza restaurant in town would be better for me.\n" u"Cheap ingredients make for cheap tasting greasy pizza. It is however clearly reflected in the very low prices which is why I would say two as opposed to one star. \n\nI could see this place being a late night drunken savior and I'm sure it serves the collegiate crowd well but if you are looking for delicious quality pizza keep on looking.\n"]
204.Galley Restaurant,[]
73.Souvlaki House,[u"Came for the Mr's college reunion and he and his friends HAD to come here to reminisce their past time here. They said the owner still looks the same and besides a new paint job everything was still the same! And what struck me as a pretty bad ass was the fact that they cut their pizzas here with a machete! Lol \n\nWe got the standard pepperoni pizza and the popeye (feta with spinach). We also started with their large Greek salad. I liked it although I think you kind of have be a pizza gourmand to appreciate the fine quality and presentation. ;-) \n\nI also got their baklava I would not recommend that if you like your baklava crunchy because it didn't have the crunch factor. \n\nService was very quick and friendly the owner is constantly scanning the room and the waitress is always running around. \n\nCheers!\n" u'Food is very fresh here. Took Atlantic salmon and pasta. The people were real nice and cordial.\n' u'HUGE portions and good service.  I never had a bad experience here as simple as that.\n' u"This is a review for the NEW Saouvlaki House. New owner is fabulous! He walks around to greet you at your table and really tries to engage with his customers. Big menu so many Greek/Italian options. Great food at very fair prices. He's going to do well!\n" u"Used to eat this place 2x per week in grad school. The artichoke chicken dish is one the best dishes I've ever eaten.\n" u"The mozzarella sticks here are very good and the Greek salad isn't bad either. They give you free breadsticks with your meal which are pretty good too. It's a little pricey for what it is though... 2 orders of mozzarella stick appetizers and a large Greek salad was $30 with tip. But if you don't feel like making the trek to nasty's from ctown for some mozz sticks then this is a good spot.\n" u"Huge portions of terribly mediocre food. Like giving me a week's supply of salad for one sitting doesn't make it any better. The seating is also really strange.\n" u"A+ eggplant parmigiana (both sub and meal). Their breadsticks are literally just hotdog buns but somehow the spices on them make these buns amazing! Oh and they're unlimited too. They have a $10 credit card minimum which they don't tell you on the phone (if you order to go) so just be aware.\n" u'Well... I\'m giving it 1 star for effort.\n\nThe "breadsticks" are literally heated up hotdog buns with some oil/seasoning on top. Literally: hotdog buns. The garlic bread is also a sandwich hero bread - cut open heated with oil and garlic seasoning. Minus two stars (and I\'m being generous)\n\nThe food itself was fine. Wont kill ya but wont taste like much. I got the chicken souvlaki wrap. It was literally just pieces of chicken a handful of romaine lettuce a few tomatoes and onions in a pita. That\'s all. No sauce no seasoning. It was boring dull. Minus one star.\n\nAlso I\'m convinced the pasta sauce was store bought - like Ragu\'s or something like that. The pasta was just spaghetti with bland sauce. Nothing more nothing less.\n\nService was OK. We definitely felt played after we stepped out. $35 for 2 people - and the food was not worth the price. Never going back. Nice people there but never going back.\n' u"The main thing this place has going for it is the price; its really cheap for the portions. The food I am not so thrilled about. Their Mediterranean/Greek food is way worse than I am used to and since Aladin's is so close by I can't imagine ever going to this place for that. Their pizza/Italian food is decent for the price and the atmosphere is homey.\n" u"I have been to Souvlaki House many times because friends insist on eating there and have never had a good experience with the food. The portions are admittedly very generous but the food itself is bland. Even something as simple as a Calzone was poorly done - the ingredients were just laid in a row not mixed up and the dough was without flavor and tough. Fish sandwich is good because its just fried frozen fish on a sandwich with fries. Its under $6 for a good portion. Pasta is not Al Dente and sauces are mediocre. I think I've gotten a gyro once and it was not at all memorable. \nIt is nice that they give salad and breadsticks for free and the waitresses are all sweethearts. However the food is just too boring. $10 credit card minimum.\n" u"I like it it's definitely above average (and I'm a picky eater) and for a collegetown restaurant AMAZING. \n\nThe portions are good (definitely a family style sharing kind of restaurant).\n\nThe food tastes pretty good pastas pizzas Greek food it's all good. \n\nThe prices are a bit... eh. So collegetown has all these overpriced restaurants because we don't have any other options. But it's not like Souvlaki House was super overpriced I'd say it was fair.\n\nThe atmosphere was good definitely laid back casual. Great family restaurant to eat at. \n\nIf you're having a major carb craving this is the greatest place to do it. Come with 4 friends and it'll be a great eating/socializing experience while sharing food and indulging yourself.\n" u"The food here is really good! I usually the Chicken Souvlaki plate and it costs around 12.95. It comes with greek salad breadsticks a pita thing and tzaki (sp?). I've had other dishes too and the food is really good and not that expensive. \n\nI am giving in three stars instead of 4 because the service here is not good. They always rush you. I always feel like they are giving you the boot. Also they do not do separate checks so it is slightly inconvenient.\n" u'I have never had a bad experience at Souvlaki House. Reasonable prices and large portions. The manager and his staff are also really nice and friendly. I recommend their greek salad souvlaki plate and Bifteki.\n' u"They offer a lunch special for $3.95 + tax (which comes to $4.25) which is probably *the* cheapest meal in Collegetown (unless you count 7-11 'cuisine' as a meal). You get a sandwich (fried fish or breaded chicken fillet) \\ with a decently sized side of fries no drink. Perfect for to-go since it only takes 10-15 min to prepare (and you can call ahead) and if you have a french fry craving to satisfy this is it.\n" u"First off I never wrote a review for a restaurant before but I felt the need to sign up for a Yelp account just to review how poor Souvlaki House is.\n\nMy friend and I went on a Friday evening and after being seated and passed by more that four times in ten minutes without getting water or asked for orders.  The restaurant wasn't even that busy so I'll give the service rating a 1/5. \n\nAfter ordering the food of which I got the Chicken Marsala and pasta on the side I was really disappointed. The pasta was literally cooked penne with tomato sauce from the can which tasted worse than middle school cafeteria pasta. The Chicken Marsala was super bland unseasoned and tasted like if I just heated a few chicken breasts in a pan. My friend ordered the Souvlaki House Special and couldn't finish it. I rate the food at 1/5 only because I can't give it a zero.\n\nWe left extremely unsatisfied and it killed our mood for the night. My recommendation is if you want better food for this price Olive Garden would be a better alternative.\n" u"This place is terrible! They put hair in my food yesterday and then made me pay for it after I complained. The manager however is always rude and abrasive. This was my last visit there but honestly the food I have gotten there previously has always been average and bland to sub-par. My friends didn't even finish half of their food and decided to throw it away rather than take it home.\n" u'Decent Greek restaurant in the area. Quick and friendly service. Their gyros were decent and they give a good amount of food.\n' u"You have to adjust your expectations accordingly here. This is not fine dining and this is not necessarily a place to branch out along the menu. \n\nThis is the Souvlaki House. As such I always get (surprise) the souvlaki. The lamb comes in big meaty chunks and it mixes well with the vegetables and the feta cheese on the pita. It's basic it's cheap and it's quick. It's also delicious. Sometimes I'll get the souvlaki plate which comes with a salad and breadsticks. Stick to what this place does best and you'll find your expectations met satisfactorily.\n" u'Souvlaki house is kinda nasty honesty...High price but big portions okay that balances out but the food suffers from extreme diminishing marginal utility. Think about eating a new bag of ships but instead of starting at the beginning where you have had nothing before start from after eating about 80% of a large bag and begin from there. That is how you will feel when you come here. The food is bland plain and thus tastes the same after only a few bites.\n']
81.Sangam Indian Cuisine,[u'The best Indian food in town. I often notice a number of cooks and waiters from neighboring restaurants heading into this restaurant to grab a meal. The food takes a little longer to come out of the kitchen at times but I think its family run with the same couple of cooks who have perfected their cuisine based on decades of all day shifts. Definitely worth a few minutes more for Indian food done right.\n' u"I am not a fan of overly spicy food but yet i love Indian food (not so spicy it burns my throat). We came here July 14th and there was no air conditioning (an immediate star drop). We thought that is was kicking in since they just opened. NOPE! The chairs were broken down full of holes etc. the staff were kind but a little on the slow side. There was also some sketchy activity going on. The delivery driver kept going in and out of the bathroom and other people seemed to come in head towards the bathroom and never leave! Secret door perhaps!\nThe food to me was too spicy and really sry. We loved the bread offerings but did not find the food as tasty as other Indian establishments we've frequented. We had more lassis then ever before due to the heat from no A/C and the spice.\n" u"I ordered some of the most basic dishes/appetizers possible and was really disappointed. How do you screw up samosas aloo chaat and kababs? I knew it was going to be an ill-fated evening when the host/ma\xeetre d actually looked annoyed when I walked in around 830 p.m. He never smiled and seemed to dislike my presence. Too much work? I sat down and just ordered a few basic things including a meat appetizer platter vegetable samosas and aloo chaat. My plan was to give it a try and if they passed come back. Needless to say I won't be going back.\n\nHow do you screw up kabobs? Maybe by microwaving meat? I was obvious to me the meat wasn't fresh and the rubbery tough texture was a dead giveaway. I admit that the meat samosa was actually good and keema was salty but tasty but how do you screw up basic sauces at an Indian restaurant? Dilute them water as was evident when I sampled the chili/mint sauce and sweet tamarind sauce. I was almost surprised to see a chicken pakora and it too tasted reheated. The samosa is really hard to screw up but this too wasn't very good. The saving grace may have been the pappad but what kind of meal is that?\n\nAll in all a disappointing experience.\n" u"They are not vegan friendly. We customized something from their menu to make it vegan. The food was fine. The service was fine but they took a huge time to serve our order. It's not easy to find parking near the restaurant since street parking is crowded.\n" u'I had my Lunch& Dinner many times here. This looks to be family owned restaurant. The lunch buffet is quite exhaustive and they generally have both South and North Indian foods! \n\nOverall this is very good Indian restaurant in town.\n' u'Just received our order which was on time and still hot. First time ordering had high hopes very disappointed. \n\nGood:\n* I ordered two pieces of naan. The naan pieces are huge and look delicious. \n* flavors pretty good. \n* huge portion of rice.\n\nHorrible:\n* our paneer pakoras are rock hard and inedible. Only four pieces for 5.90.\n* our malai kofta meant to be shared by two adults and one child has three kofta balls swimming in a sea of sauce. The balls are the size of small meatballs.\n* We ordered two entrees. Each was supposed to come with two chutneys  (mint and tamarind). We only got two chutneys in those small plastic ramekins; each ramekin is only a third full. I think we were also supposed to get a tamarind chutney with our samosas but there are only the two- again- to be shared two and a half ways. We also got a ramekin with some soft plain diced tomatoes which was maybe a quarter full.\n\nFor a meal that came to $54 this is truly pathetic. Would never order from them again.\n\nTwo stars and a heaping helping of karma for Sagnam!\n' u"I love Indian food and I've had Indian food from different states that I've lived in but this food is just plain bland and it made me sick! I ordered meat samosas and goat curry. Both did not look or taste fresh...sort of like leftover food that has been reheated.  The good also tasted very bland not as flavorful as Indian food. I was hungry so I ate the food for dinner only to wake up with a stomach ache. I'm throwing away what is left of the food from last night that I paid $20 for. Save your money and your health and stay away from this restaurant.\n" u"I'll be honest I have never really tried indian food before coming here and if you have never tried but want to order the tikka masala! It's mild enough for those who are sensitive to spices and tastes delicious and creamy! Also I usually order a basket of naan as an appetizer because they are HUGE and yummy especially when warm.. The lunch buffets are also a great deal. I always leave the restaurant really full and satisfied :)\n" u"I used to always be a fan of Sangam but within the last year every time I've eaten there I've been really disappointed. I recently ordered Dal Makhani and Chicken sag. They both tasted off very bland and the chicken was just dry. The paratha was also bland. I don't think I've ever had under seasoned Indian food. No chutneys with my to-go order either. With so many other great options in town I won't be returning.\n" u'Loved Sangam!    During a visit to Ithaca my friend and I visited for the buffet and it was delicious!     Much spicer than the buffets in Syracuse the food was so good.     A nice selection of veg choices with a couple non-veg chicken dishes reminded me of food that I had while in India.     We got there early for lunch but it filled up quickly as classes got out near noon and the place filled with mostly Indian students.   \n\nI need to figure out more reasons to come to Ithaca just so I can visit again.\n' u'Real nice job on typical Indian food. All the hits.\nSamosas. Chicken tikka. Lamb organ josh. Vindaloo. And perfect nan. Service matches quality of food. A terrific choice whilst in collegetown.\n' u"First off this is the first review that I've done on Yelp in over three years. Wow can't believe college took that much time away from Yelping. Lucky for me though as a Cornell student I got to try Sangam. \n\nI went to Indian lunch buffet almost twice a week on Fridays and Saturdays. The salad is absolutely amazing. It's right at the front of the buffet line next to the sliced pieces of cantaloupe. The dressing is also one of my favorites. It can also be used to dilute your curry or masala if they're too spicy. \n\nThe naan oh my goodness is the best especially when it's warm. \n\nThe tikka masala forget about a review! Go in and try it I promise it'll be one of the richest masalas you can find. It's a dark red sauce with chicken. Just by looking at the color and texture you can tell it's solid. \n\nThe desserts however are what separate Sangam from the other Indian restaurant in College Town. The Gajar Halwa mushed-carrots raisins and what seems to be condensed milk is super sweet. Often times a burner is placed underneath to make it warm. If this isn't enough the Kheer a rice-pudding type classic is also really great. \n\nI can't wait to go back for Homecoming or Slope Day at Cornell!\n" u'The food here is tasteless and the manager thinks he is doing you a favor when you ask for more rice or a take out. Despite being served by a nice young woman the manager began hovering around our table once we were done.  Then  he swooped in when we stood up and we saw him taking and pocketing our tip.  If you want to tip the waitstaff I suggest you give it to them once they bring your meal.\n' u'Our experience with this restaurant was miserable. I ordered a take-out order and was told it would take 45 minutes to an hour. I showed up after an hour and was told it would take 20 more minutes. After 20 minutes I was told it would take another 10 minutes. I got the impression that they had not even begun taking care of our order and cancelled at that point. No apology was made at any point.\n' u"I am a regular customer and visited Sangam often in this 5 years but the latest time I went there for lunch buffet is the most disappoint. The food is low quality and very pricey for 9.40$ lunch buffet. I got plain spicy chicken curry rice is very hard less choice of buffet is compared to year 2012-2014. They rise the price but the quality of food and service is lower than couple years ago. Restaurant has the very big spider web at the top right corner of the table by the window that look like they did not clean up for so many month. It's very scary. They served the expired cantalupe which is too sour bad taste in your mouth and unhealthy for your health. I think they did not served cousine as their claimed anymore.  \n\nOver all I am very disappointed even I was very like their masala lamp curry for my dinner but I will not go back. I preferred Thai restaurant downtown for better and real authentic gourmet curry.\n" u"I ordered from them because they are the only Indian restaurant on Ithacatogo. Everything about my experience was bad. Let's start with the fact that they completely forgot my goat vindaloo. Apparently they forgot to write it on my ticket. So I call and after having to talk to three different people I am told that they can get it to me in half an hour. Apparently I am just supposed to wait for it while the rest of our food gets cold. Instead I opted to call Ithaca To Go and get a refund for that dish. Then there is the fact that the dal had too much stacked on it on so by the time it got to me the lid had broken and half of it was in the bottom of the back. Add to that the fact that the samosas are $5 for two and top it all off with the fact that it is the most mediocre Indian I have ever had. Don't waste your time with this place. You will get nothing but disappointment.\n" u"I've only eaten here a few times for the lunch buffet but every time something goes wrong. Either the ancient credit card machine breaks down or the naan bread is mysteriously missing. During the buffet one-too-many waiters attempt to refill my water after I take one sip. This over attention to the water refilling made me feel uncomfortable. After I was done eating (the food good) and payed I checked my receipt and noticed that there was an automatic gratuity added to my check. This shocked me. Tipping at a normal restaurant should be to the discretion of the customer. In this case there wasn't normal waiter service but gratuity was expected. Next time I will go to Meehak next door.\n" u"Lunch buffet is a pretty good deal. The food is mostly mediocre though. But they do give you lots of options to try at a low cost so you can't complain too much. I tried a little bit of everything and liked the chicken curry the most. You can easily get your money's worth in two or three plates. It's a solid establishment and a good way to get a filling budget meal in town.\n" u'DONT use ithaca to go for these guys. They are really stingy and the food is far inferior to mehak\'s. I got like 5 tiny shreds of chicken in my "chicken tikka masala" which tasted more like spaghetti-os with Sriracha sauce.\n' u'Sangam is the restaurant I hold all other Indian restaurants up to.  After eating at many other Indian restaurants I find myself wanting to be back at Sangam.  The food has always been hot and fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend Sangam for solid Indian fare.\n']
116.Ithaca Bakery,[u'Usually not a bad meal but for some reason the Bronx breakfast sandwich was not up to par this morning. Bagel cold- not toasted  sausage and egg cold. Only thing hot was coffee.\n\n\nSoooooo discussed AM issues with management. Apologies accepted. For that 3 stars.\n' u'My girlfriend and I went here for breakfast and she ordered a Brooklyn Bagel (bacon egg and cheese on a toasted bagel) and I ordered a Florentine Wrap (spinach tortilla spinach "scrambled egg" feta mushrooms). \n\nHer bagel came untoasted and both of our "eggs" came in the form of an ugly yellow gelatinous rubber hockey puck. There\'s no way that was a scrambled egg. The cheese and the bacon were fine though. \n\nMy wrap was entirely raw. Every ingredient (except the "egg" probably?) was uncooked. I know some people like raw mushrooms but it just did not mesh well with the cold egg puck and the rest of the chewy uncooked wrap. The feta was good I ended up just picking out the feta and eating it. \n\nWe were just so incredibly disturbed by the egg patties. They didn\'t taste the least like eggs which was especially disappointing given how much they advertised their "farm to fork" policy. I\'m pretty sure those were out of a carton or a factory or something. \n\nHowever we did order an Aztec Winter Shake which we enjoyed a lot. Sweet with some spice really pleasing.\n' u"Unlike the other reviews I didn't have any experiences with poor service but I was disappointed by the food quality of something that's supposed to be an Ithaca classic. \n\nI ordered a Tuscan Verde a Toasted Cheese with Tomato & Bacon soup and a chocolate-hazelnut filled croissant.\n\n1. Tuscan Verde - terrible sandwich would not recommend to anyone. The chicken was dry and cold. Let in large chunks pretty chalky and flavorless. The sandwich had no sense of togetherness and the tomatoes were the really firm and tasteless supermarket variety. The sandwich was lacking in moisture for sure. The focaccia was also unimpressive; nice texture but no real flavor of olive oil or any seasonings and not much a crust.\n\n2. Toasted Cheese with Tomato & Bacon Soup - this was 5/5 would get again. Not too cloying decently cheesey. Definitely tasted like smoked gouda & bacon. Good with a dash of tabasco for acidity balance.\n\n3. Chocolate-Hazelnut Croissant - there was no offer to heat it so it was pretty cold when I got it. It is literally 90% air and I don't mean in a nicely layered way either I mean there were a dozen layers and then a giant cavern with a really small bit of nutella (see my picture for what i mean. It didn't taste that buttery it did flake well though. Not much substance.\n" u"Out of all of the college town bagels this was is by far the most disorganized and poorly run. \n\nOnly reason I come here is because it is close to my work and I just get soup cause it is already made and the staff can't mess it up. My last encounter I waited 30 minutes for 2 salads that came out incorrectly...... \n\nThe poor service is one thing but the menu is maybe a quarter of the size than the other locations. Probably a good thing though don't want to confuse the staff too much...... \n\nNew management should be considered\n" u"Makes 100s of stuff but never concentrate making one better. I'm a fan of limited item menu but each of them excellent master.  Never again here.\n" u'This is the most inconsistent branch of the Bakery. They need to teach and watch their employees construct the food before allowing it to be sent to the customer especially the to-go items. Today I purchased a to-go $6.20 CTBLT and found that it had one piece of bacon once piece of lettuce no mayonnaise and a tiny lump of avocado. If this was a one time mistake it would be fine but this happens every other time I go there. So much for hoping they will improve their staff skills.\n' u"I usually don't like to give bad reviews publicly but I will make an exception for this disaster. I used to take my staff here for lunch over the summer at least twice a week and despite the food being mediocre we loved the coffee and a couple of the employees that always waited on us and treated us so well. We started scaling back to once every other week in the late fall due to the long waits and the complete lack of management. Our last four experiences since Christmas have been nothing short of awful. The food was terrible the waiting time was almost an hour and the service was disgusting. The staff seemed more interested in chatting with each other and less interested in serving customers. The management seemed arrogant and borderline abusive to the staff which may explain why the staff were less than enthusiastic. When I asked to speak with a manager about the long wait and poor customer service the man I talked to said that it was very busy and that he was the assistant manager he told me that he would let his boss know that there was a complaint and that's all he could do. He said if I don't like it there then I shouldn't come back that I'm a regular and I should understand the way it works there. I said OK and I took my colleagues and we left. We will not be returning and we will not be asking Ithaca Bakery to cater our annual office picnic this summer as they have for the past three years. It's a shame because we always looked forward to their catering in June. My office my colleagues and my family are all finished with this place. We have also spread the word.\n" u"This place has ridiculously long waits for gross food. After waiting 20 minutes for our breakfast sandwiches they finally came out and the egg looked like a disturbing yellow hockey puck on a lukewarm bagel. We would have been better off getting egg mcmuffins at McDonalds...we'd even get hashbrowns...\n" u"Here are my PROS: The location is so convenient for those of us that don't live downtown and it's quite nice to go somewhere with a parking lot. The menu has terrific variety and the bakery case holds many many goodies. \n\nThe CONS: As others have mentioned the service isn't great. It is amazing how uninterested and annoyed the cashiers seem. I don't need the kind of skippy-go-lucky service offered by a smiley bubbly person but I also don't like feeling that I've shown up uninvited to a private party when ordering a sandwich at a cafe. I also think the prices are slightly on the high side for what you get. If menu items cost a little less I'd be more inclined to buy a dessert and a soda with my sandwich but at $9 for the sandwich I can't justify getting anything else.\n" u'Pros: MANY vegetarian options & a few vegan ones "outdoor" (in the mall) patio table seating - which is good for kids tasty coffee with soymilk available (without asking - it\'s just out with the milk & cream - awesome!) free cups for tap water recycle/compost station right at the trash. \n\nCons: the customer service here is... inconsistent and the staff comes across as often disinterested or annoyed. I\'ve felt rushed in placing my order or that I\'m inconveniencing the staff. Also the "flow" through this location is congested. The sandwich board isn\'t easily visible from the order taking spot the pastries are on the opposite side of the cold drink case which is across the store from the coffee same with the instant oatmeal & the hot water with which to prepare it. Prepared foods are in the front but if you\'re trying to look through that case you\'re in the way of customers trying to pick up their orders. \n\nOverall: Order/payment/pickup counter needs more thoughtful planning & customer service needs work. \nFood options taste & environmental impact are great (& keep us coming back)\n' u'Way....way....way too expensive. $9 for a roast beef and cheese sandwich on rye  bread with a can of soda. \nI was expecting to get a giant roast beef sandwich with chips and got a very disappointing sized sandwich with no chips.\nNot going back.\n' u"I'm not all that impressed. As others have mentioned the service is uncharacteristically bad here. I'll have to visit the other location to see if it's different. The employees I came into contact with seemed very gruff impatient and possibly crossing the line into rude.\n\nThe one saving grace of Ithaca Bakery is that the baked goods are pretty tasty. The sandwiches are just OK mostly because they don't seem to be put together with much care. For example I ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich. The bagel was excellent but the egg was tasteless and the cheese was still cold. Long gone are the days when plain eggs beat and cooked makes scrambled eggs. I can get that at McDonald's. Put a bit of thought and creativity into your menu items!\n" u"Quality food in a cafe/bakery environment with many college student-type staff.  Lots of sandwich options including vegetarian fare.  Clean and presentable.  I just didn't really get the knock-your-socks off feeling from this place...perhaps price-performance ratio was lower than hoped.  I think I would prefer Panera over this place but that should help you benchmark the food here.\n" u"I so liked this bakery that over the course of the weekend visit to Ithaca I stopped 3 times.\n1st they serve awesome coffee lattes and expresso with 100% free trade Cayuga coffee.\n2nd there bagels have substance and are not those fluffy versions from Panera or Einstein's.\n3rd they have a nice breakfast buffet selection that you can purchase by weight and service is so friendly. \n4th I like how the compost recycle and trash waste and all their containers are compost-able.\n" u"Tons of options to choose from with lots of fresh and tasty ingredients. I picked out my own and made a custom bagel sandwich (lox and cream cheese red onion capers arugula on a long island bagel) and it came out exactly as I hoped. Delicious! Lots of great baked goods as well. The manager Nathan was helpful and friendly and made sure we had a great experience. We will definitely be back next time we're in town!\n" u"This updated review is for their bagels and 2 sandwiches I've tried: the Parisian and Laura's Sweet Surprise. My 2 star review still holds for the breakfast sandwiches but I felt I needed to revise my review after thoroughly enjoying a pumpkin bagel with cinnamon sugar and Laura's sweet surprise.\n" u"Yuck! What is this awful difference between Ithaca Bakery on Triphammer and the one downtown? Downtown is SO much better I wouldn't think they were even related.\n" u'Food was good. Service was not.\nI ordered a breakfast egg wrap but the waiter thought I ordered a different sandwich.  After explaining the mix up he refused to bring me the right order.  I was not impressed.\n' u'Just can\'t get it right.....\n\nI\'ve come to this location on more than ten occasions and they have yet to get my order right. I order a "huevos sonara on an open face onion bagel."  After paying a premium and normally waiting over 20min I receive a bagel with only cheese and salsa... without guacamole and egg... It\'s called "huevos" for a reason. So I kindly send it back and after waiting another 20min they return with a huevos sonara in a wrap... Again without guacamole.   They have similarly messed up ten prior times. Hopefully you have better luck.\n' u"This new location of Ithaca Bakery is in the spot inhabited by Hope's Way bakery and catering for the last several years.  This change of hands has only gone down in the past several months - not sure what happened to Hope or her Way.\n\nThis place is close to being awesome.  They have a great display case of delicious cakes baked goods prepared salads and tasty meals.  They have a great menu of soups and sandwiches as well and did a really brisk lunch business while we were there.  My lady and I both ordered the soup - i thought the chicken tortellini was well seasoned and hearty; she thought the potato leek was over-peppered and too smooth.\n\nThe main opportunity for improvement is the ordering process.  When you go in the front door they take orders to the right then you take your check back through the line around the case and pay by the coffee station.  This is incredibly confusing - we must have heard them explain to at least 5-6 people just in the 10 minutes we were waiting how to place their order - it is not intuitive or set up efficiently at all.  On top of that the beverage case is about 15 feet from the registers and if you want a juice or soda you either have to hold everyone up and walk over or just kind of point and gesture.  \n\nIf they put up some good signs and straightened out the ordering process Ithaca Bakery would make a great tasty lunch spot!\n"]
59.Temple of Zeus,[u"I love this place especially scone here is really tasty! It is almost the only food place that opens in the summer at Cornell. Food here is cheap and great. They didn't accept Cornell BRB.\n" u"This place is located on the Cornell campus -- but it doesn't accept Cornell's campus currency Big Red Bucks (BRBs). Coffees are undersized and overpriced as are the sandwiches (they also charge $1.50 extra for a single slice of cheese).\n\nThis place is a scam. It's a shame and a sham that Cornell has chosen to allow them a place on campus to exploit students.\n" u"This neat cafe is located in the new Klarman Hall. Their espresso drinks are great and you have the option of having your drink in a ceramic mug (for here) or in a portable to-go cup (if you want it to-go). The downside is that it's a bit overpriced ($4.76 for a small 8 oz latte) they don't take BRBs and seating is limited.\n" u"Not a lot of people know about this place for some reason!\n\n- They have homemade soups usually two kinds everyday and runs out fast. Their bean soups are great and don't forget to get a pice of bread from your right. \n- Their sandwiches are good but especially on pita and topped with bean sprouts. \n- The lines are way too long from 12:00pm to 12:45 pm not worth the wait.\n\nBest part: When Ithaca gets warmer grab a coffee and a croissant and sit outside in their patio chairs overlooking the Arts Quad and the beautiful campus that this is.\n" u'Temple of Zues is the best place. Get there at 11:30 for some awesome homemade soup! Great for vegetarians too.\n' u"BY FAR my favorite spot to eat on campus. If you're confused by the menu don't be shy ask the staff what they recommend and work from there.\n\nToZ also has THE BEST SOUP ON CAMPUS. MAYBE THE BEST SOUP EVER (** If you can get there on time - usually before 1:00pm). \n\nThough their lines can sometimes be long I've never been more happy to wait for food. Their ingredients are fresh local and often organic. Sandwiches salads and wraps are made to-order and the staff is friendly and sociable. \n\nTheir pita's are unlike anything else you'll be able to purchase on campus and because they are not associated with Cornell Dining they have the advantage of keeping their prices low and being able to use the best ingredients out there.\n\nDefinitely try some salad dressings on your pita if you're feeling adventurous. Personal recommendations:\n\n -BLTease (Tofu Gouda Mayo) with Miso Ginger (hold the mustard though)\n- BLTease with Tomato Basil\n- Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato Basil & Balsamic vinaigrette \n- Turkey with fresh mozzarella and balsamic vinaigrette\n- BLTease with tobasco!\n- Egg Salad with Tomato Basil\n- Roast Beef with Honey Mustard\n\nChoklay and Nyima are culinary wizards.\n" u"They always have great soup--that is unless you get here late and it's SOLD OUT!  There are good sandwich options and of course they have vegetarian and VEGAN foods available including seitan or hummus for sandwiches soups (I'm eating chickpea tomato now!) and various snacks! The staff each semester is very friendly as well. This is not Cornell dining the prices are fair!\nOh and if you're planning to get soup don't show up near closing and expect there will be any left and also BYOB/M Bring your own bowl or super-sized mug (such as my Pyrex mug with lid) the staff appreciates that you're not using a paper bowl so you'll get a smile and a Bonus of soup!\n" u'On a cold winter day in Ithaca there is no cheaper or better soup than that of Temple of Zeus. \n\nThis restaurant provide a healthy affordable lunch to students.\n' u"Easily one of the best on-campus cafes. The soups are very good but be warned they sell out. Limited seating in the cafe but a great grab and go type of spot. Also bear in mind they don't take BRBs. They will however accept CornellCard.\n" u"I honestly don't know why people love the soup here. I'm a BIG fan of soups so I was excited to try the famed Temple of Zeus soups but I was sorely disappointed. Both soups I tried were nearly inedible. I believe one was groundnut and the other one was a tomato one. They didn't taste good and they had a weird grainy texture. The soups at Big Red Barn are much better. \n\nI do like the sandwiches here. You can build your own with meats like turkey and roast beef veggies (cucumber tomato sprouts onions) and cheese. They build them fresh and really pile on the ingredients.  \n\nThey also have pastries bagels and to-go foods. It's 10 cents for a cup of water free if you bring your own cup. They have a microwave and a toaster too!\n" u'The best place for lunch on Cornell campus especially for soup. Great fresh and healthy sandwiches too. Friendly employees. $ off for bringing your own container for soup.\n' u'The soup here seems a bit overrated. Sometimes good sometimes just okay rarely very filling for some reason. None of the other offerings often really excite me either; Zeus often only wins out over other options because of its convenience (and the fact that they offer Gimme coffee).\n' u"Every student who ever has a class on or near the Arts Quad has to check this place out at least once.  The homemade soups are made fresh every morning with local ingredients (can't get any more Ithacan than that) with the experience of Choklay who's trained at the world-famous (also local) Moosewood Restaurant.  There are 2 soups offered daily (favorites: groundnut tomato garlic crema de elote mulligitawny ratatouille)  along with a selection of salads sandwiches (you can get meat) and pitas (I was a big fan of the vegetarian pita A. because it was cheap at something like $1.50 which might seem expensive for just half a pita with greens/tomato but B. it was totally stuffed with said veggies and it made me feel good.  They also have things brought from an Asian eatery somewhere in town which include v. delicious peanut/sesame noodles.\n\nSure you can sell out to the man (a.k.a. CU Dining) and go for a prepackaged salad/sandwich at the Green Dragon Big Red Barn or leg it a bit further to the Ivy Room but when you can spend half as much for better food...why don't you?\n" u"Do not miss Temple of Zeus! A must-eat lunch spot for anyone who finds his or her self on the hill. It's all about the soup.\n\nMost of their soup recipes (which are all vegetarian by the way) are available online: http://www.arts.cornell.edu/zeus/more.info.html\n\nGet there early! I'd often miss the soup by about 2 or 3 bowls if I dawdled after my 11:15 ended.\n" u"Soup!!!  I can't think of any place that made me look forward to lunch more.  As Chris B said the recipes are on-line but being able to get this type of belly-filling taste-bud dancing goodness day in and day out makes all the difference.  Don't miss it....and do get there early!  Mulligatawny tomato or the groundnut...you can't go wrong!\n" u"This is my favorite lunch place on the blue speck. I love great soup and I sample soups wherever I go. Drum roll please...or you can do that finger thing instead... ... ... I sometimes don't have my drum on me either... ...    ...      ...         ...okay: This is the tastiest soup there has ever been or ever will be until the end of time. No joke.\n\nZeus is a small cafe that's sort of in-between the first floor and the basement of Goldwin Smith Hall on the Cornell campus. Their focus is on fresh and healthy lunch-time options with a special focus on vegetarian and vegan options (all of their soups are vegetarian one of the two daily soups is vegan). Soups are fragrant uplifting colorful savory euphoric and impossible to ever forget. Try Groundnut or East African Stew and be transported to a far-away land where ginger peppers peanuts and spice toy with basmati and the luckiest yams in the world. Try Thai Carrot with its silky orange puree and coconut-lime-chili medley. Or sip cilantro-strewn gazpacho to tame a 90-degree summer's day. All soups are made fresh that morning by a couple of the most under-appreciated culinary geniuses (C and N) the heavens ever gave us. \n\nIf you can get past the soups (which you can't) go for a B.L. Tease (cooked tofu mixed with smoked gouda and a bit of mayo; bacony for the vege kids!) or the seitan-and-hummus with it's garlicy garbanzos. \n\nHeaven should taste like Temple of Zeus soups. If it doesn't it should shape up now so it's ready by the time I get there.\n"]
168.Stella‚Äôs Barn,[u"Excellent food great wait staff very friendly.  I especially like the bartender Victoria(aka Tory) She makes you feel like you're part of the family.  Definitely go here for a great time. Even if you show up by yourself you'll meet a new friend here.\n" u"The food was good.  Actually surprisingly good. Too bad we had to ask the waitress almost everything...what is the soup of the day?  What is today's vegetable?  She wasn't exactly forthcoming with information.  Perhaps she too was distracted by the poorly mannered group nearby.  Unfortunately those customers which seemed to be known by the staff were horrifically self centered and rude with their small children adults encouraging  lots of LOUD shrieking and screaming.  \n The evening spiraled from a semi quiet  place where one could talk to their companions with ease to a stressful dinner at the equivalent of a child's play space or chuck-e-cheese.  \nCould not wait to get out of there.\n" u'I don\'t know about Stella\'s. It has good reviews but it wasn\'t really for me. It all started with a bad first impression. We stood at the hostess area waiting to be seated and this woman just stood there occasionally looking at us. At first I thought she worked there then I thought she must not because she wasn\'t helping us. Then as I stared at her she finally decided to come over and asked if she could help us. Yeah we\'d like a table! She asked if we had a reservation and we said no. She seemed really put off by that and said "I\'ll see what I can do." She seated us in the bar area which was fine but as we dined I couldn\'t help but notice the restaurant had plenty of empty tables including ones outside. It doesn\'t really seem like a reservation-type place anyway. Overall she just seemed really annoyed to even be helping us with anything. So then there was the menu. All of the promotions for this place boast country-style comfort food but it really wasn\'t anything like that. It was very standard American fare with an emphasis on seafood and steaks...not really comfort food. \n\nOne of the few southern-style items on the menu fried chicken came out super dry. I mean really really dry and there was barely any meat on any of the bones. It was mostly crispy fried breading. It was really probably one of the worst fried chicken dishes I\'ve had. KFC does better.\n\nWe also ordered some of their unique egg rolls. These were actually very good and I\'d recommend them. We got the Tommie Rolls with spinach feta chicken mushrooms and garlic. They were served with a side of marinara for dipping.\n' u'I was honestly not expecting too much since the reviews were all over the board however I was pleasantly surprised that my service was great and the variety of dishes were great. Great prices coupled with great service was the key factor in getting the 4 stars. The only loss of star was the portion of food for a hungry large man was not there but the wife thought her portions were great.\n' u"Lunch at Stella's today.\nNice rustic atmosphere friendly helpful staff.  \n\nThe food was great and portions were generous.... $9-$10 for lunch.\n\nTry the sausage bites... yum.\n" u"Had a delicious burger sweet potato fries and an interesting beer Shock Top. Service was good and didn't have to wait for a table.\n" u"Service was fair but I paid $28 for the steak special that was supposed to have a bourbon sauce on it. I got a grizzly piece of meat with a flavorless sauce. I won't be  back.\n" u'Pretty standard American food - nothing to write home about but I was satisfied with my meal. I had the asiago panini with grilled chicken and French fries and ended up taking half of the sandwich home because it was so filling. My parents are regulars and love the meatloaf and other comfort foods they offer.\n' u"This is my favorite breakfast place in Ithaca! I'm not a buffet person I like to just order the entree I want. Gotta try the stuffed French toast! I'm in love with it! The service is always prompt and polite. I love the quant decor. It's cute! Check it out!\n" u'This was not my greatest experience dining-wise to say the least.\n\nDespite the resoundingly positive reviews I found the meal to be quite sub par. The lettuce was poor quality and the salmon was fairly unappetizing as well. My girlfriend and I both took only a few bites of our entrees before packing up. \n\nTo be fair the toasted ravioli was decent and maybe it was our fault for ordering bad items. But still a restaurant should show the same level of expertise in all their dishes - not just the fried ones.\n\nI would not attribute this experience to be out of the ordinary either. It didn\'t seem like an off night - the service was friendly and attentive.\n\nHowever there was an odd addition to our bill that would have nearly doubled the meals price - and the waitress\'s tip. IT WAS MOST LIKELY A SIMPLE MISTAKE but adding another dish and $25 of "misc food" on the bill came off almost as fishy as that salmon.\n\nIf you care to dine check your bills and bon appetite.\n' u'Consistently excellent American food. Something for everyone and excellent service. Casual family place. Our go-to place.\n' u"Had a rehearsal dinner in the back room.  Service was great as well as the food.  Only negative was that the room was hot and could have used some AC.  Decorated nicely.  Very pleased with Stella's.  Definitely recommend!\n" u"The best restaurant in Newfield! I've been here twice and love it. Wonderful servers comfortable atmosphere and fabulous food. We got our meals quick and the steak and seafood was on-point. Definitely worth it.\n" u'Stella\'s Barn was a treat. It\'s only about 15 minutes outside of Ithaca but no one in Ithaca has food like they offer there so it is worth the drive\n\nThe atmosphere is "causal country" but very nice.  I\'m Texan so I loved the Texan stars. The server Jennifer was so great. She was friendly and helpful. \n\nThe food was GREAT! The cornbread was delicious cakey and sweet but not overly so. The salad was just so-so. We had sweet potato fries for an appetizer. Outstanding. Amazing. Delicious! They were thick cut and well cooked AND they came with an awesome dipping sauce.\n\nI got chicken fried steak and it was GREAT! I was so impressed. It was crisp and savory with a nice cream sauce. The sides were lovely too mashed potatoes and zucchini. \n\nMy husband had the chicken in a basket (fried chicken) with mac and cheese.  Again the entree was great. The chicken was crisp and delicious.  The mac and cheese was cheesy. :) \n\nLastly we split a piece of fantastic peanut butter pie. \n\nWe will be back!\n' u'Such a friendly place with nice staff and good food. Garlic mash potatoes are great!!\n' u"My mom wanted to try it out so we asked to see a menu before sitting down to see what vegetarian/ vegan choices there might be if any. I saw they had a veggie burger offered and asked the waitress if the veggie burger was made with cheese. I was assured by staff that the veggie burger itself was vegan and cheese free. \nWhen my food arrived the veggie burger was indeed made with cheese in the patty. This was extremely unfortunate because there wasn't a single other thing on the menu that I could eat. \nThe waitress handled the whole thing with grace and worked with the kitchen to come up with something for me to eat which I truly appreciate. However overall this was a truly terrible dining experience. \nAside from that disaster the sweet potato fries were pretty good and my mom seemed to like her fish sandwich. It wouldn't be fair to expect every restaurant to accommodate every dietary restriction but I don't know what else I could have done to avoid this misadventure.\n" u"Stella's Barn is a little gem located about 15 minutes outside of Ithaca. Its certainly worth the drive.\n\nStella's Barn offers great food at a great price in a comfortable laid-back environment. The staff and owner are very nice knowledgeable and accommodating.\n\nI'm a vegan and they've always been great about accommodating me even though they're a small place near the middle of nowhere. I always get a heaping amount of pasta with fresh marinara.\n\nThe salad is probably my favorite part. They're quite simple but obviously extremely fresh and you just can't beat that.\n\nMy boyfriend loves the (free) cornbread and raves about the salmon.\n\nOverall this place is a cozy country spot worth the drive.\n" u"What a great little place. We went this evening. The food was delicious and reasonable. I had the meatloaf and it was really good. Served with gravy and garlic mashed potatoes. Yummy. My husband had the chicken breast and also enjoyed it. The cornbread is the best I've had. We will definitely go back again. Good service and the waitress even gave us extra cornbread to take home. How great is that?\n" u"I wanted to give a good review but our experience was mediocre. The hostess wasn't even at the door when we arrived.  We were a party of 16 with a reservation. It took 45 minutes just for the waitress to get our drinks from the bar.  My boyfriends glass was so condensed from sitting for so long it slipped right out of his hand.  The waitress got him and new one and charged us for it. I can understand both sides. But with years of customer service experience I don't think we should have been charged for the spilled drink. It was an hour and a half before we got our food.  Which was just OK. The steak was over cooked and tough. The potatoes were dry. Pulled pork was pretty good.  All the desserts looked like they came from a box mix.  The waitress was cold and unfriendly. She never told us her name or the soup of the day. Just started taking drink orders(which like just said took 45 minutes to receive) We left unhappy and none of the 16 that attended will be returning.\n" u'A charming laid-back restaurant in the middle of nowhere.  Lots of interesting touches offered on the menu.  There\'s same old same old comfort food for those who want it but entrees like cheese-stuffed rigatoni with chicken for those looking for something new and different.  Their sweet potato fries come with "special sauce" for dipping.  The servers are attentive and warm.  From the outside it looks like a country gifts shop but the food is well worth the trip there.\n']
37.Oasis Halal Grill,[u'Love their lamb gyro. The serving portions are quite generous as well. The rice are a little hard hence the four stars.\n' u"Before I get into it the food is perfectly fine. Little has changed on that front and portions are still massive. The taste is also perfectly fine. 100% happy there. The bulk of my rating this time has more to do with whoever took my husband's payment this evening and it's the reason we will not be back. If you're willing to get yelled at for using an online ordering system as designed feel free to proceed. Food's fine.\n\nThis establishment lists itself on GrubHub which I prefer because A) I get to see the whole menu and B) I personally don't have to call anyone and risk something getting lost in translation as has happened with other establishments in the past. My husband is the one who pays primarily because it's the easiest way for him to pay without having to sign up for Grubhub himself - I already had the account so why not? Our only shared account is an AmEx which isn't accepted everywhere so we usually don't use it when he's picking up food for us and because he's the one making the physical pickup and most of these places require his ID which would need to match the name on the credit card. He also prefers cash because we're not tacking on debt we might forget about until we've already been charged interest for it. I'm happy to keep his inbox slightly cleaner by using my own with a Grubhub account to make orders. This is the third time we've visited this shop as we haven't made it a habit; parking in that area is a bit of pain for my husband so we avoid it unless students are on break.\n\nWhen my husband came up tonight to pay for our order - placed on Grubhub - the person taking his money decided to yell at him for our decision to order through Grubhub. I was not there but I wish to address the owner directly now: You choose to list your establishment on Grubhub. You are aware of their policies of taking a cut. You are aware that Grubhub makes the option available to pay in cash. You do not get to decide how someone does or does not use Grubhub whether it helps them (supposedly costs less to pay with credit or to call the store directly?) or not. By taking credit cards you *also* lose a specific cut of the money to the credit card providers or whatever service you might use to take credit; you wouldn't yell at those people so why yell at my husband for paying cash? You are the one who also lists *two coupons* with Grubhub knowing full well that maybe a couple of people might be paying with cash too especially in a college town with students that are much more prone to use technology as intended; are you going to get upset with them if they pay cash and perhaps take advantage of that free soda with $25 purchase? In short: You do not get to use that service then get upset with someone for using that service without running the risk of losing business because you are upset that the service *you willingly continue to use* takes a cut of the money. You are not new to Grubhub. You know how it works. You know its methods of payment that it offers. That is not our problem; that is yours. If you are no longer satisfied with Grubhub take it up with them or remove yourself from those listings. Just be aware that any other online ordering system is going to have those same limitations. If it hurts your bottom line protect your business not the thing that is supposedly hurting it and don't yell at someone that uses it exactly as designed! None of this was new to you! I would know because all three times we used Grubhub and you've continued to use it despite people using it and probably paying cash occasionally.\n\nMy husband went in there for food not a lecture because someone was upset with the way *Grubhub* does business. My husband had enough integrity to pay even after being yelled at because he's not a jerk. That's more than I can say about the guy doing the yelling.\n\nI had to apologize to my husband because someone was upset that we used Grubhub in a perfectly predictable fashion. My husband doesn't like Oasis as much as I did and he only agreed to it for me tonight. Oasis your food was good but there are other establishments in town who will be perfectly happy to accept our money no matter what service we do or do not use to order. Good luck with your business; with that attitude you'll need it especially if as others say you're inconsistent with your hours. Adios Oasis because tonight's the last time you get our money; hello other perfectly acceptable establishments with similar food and a better parking situation. We all win right?\n\nWe won't be back.\n" u'No. Do not order from here. I waited over 2 hours for my food with no response. I called over 10 times with no answer. I got scammed out of my money and want a complete refund. A $40 order that amounted to nothing. -10 stars if i could give it that. Do NOT give this place business.\n' u'Really good. I ordered chicken shwarma with cumbers and onions along with a side or grape leaves. Everything was fresh and delicious.\n' u"The owner is inconsistent with his hours. I called him a few days ago and he said he would be open Monday regular hours. I tried calling him today and he's closed. The foods not bad but don't bother getting attached to this place.\n\nThe food is okay at the most but the owner doesn't know how to run his business. This is place is by far the worst customer service you can possibly think of. Long story short every time I have called the owner he repeatedly told me he will be open two days from the call. I called him two days later same story again. Either run the business or let your customers know you will be closed for a long time. Run a business and stop lying to your customers. Oasis has been in Ithaca for almost a year now and you never know if they are open or not it is a poorly ran business. If you are looking for good customer service go to Istaanbul in ithaca for middle eastern food.\n" u'I got the lamb gyro over rice platter. They give a lot of food and the meat+sauces over rice made it very good. Everyone who worked there was very friendly I would probably come again.\n' u'I love Oasis. I have been a few times and have enjoyed my meal. The two guys that work there are very kind and attentive. Serving portions are generous. My go to is the chicken shawarma over rice. They also make great simple salads. Support this counter service restaurant!\n' u'Great pita wraps and salad options! Not only is the food delicious and healthy but the owner is also super nice and provides great service.\n' u'I experienced bad customer service by one of the staff. Disorganized and took me more than 45 mins to wait. He just made me wait. He did not even tell me how long I have to wait nor if I was willing to wait that long. He just told me "sit down i will cook it." I was very confused. Not a very pleasant experience.\n' u'I ordered a Chicken Shawarma to go and was rushing to catch a bus. Though I rushed him  the sandwich tasted great and the meat was rich. Definitely going to be my go-to place\n']
189.Tower Club,[]
35.That‚Äôs How I Roll,[u"This has been consistently one of my favorite food trucks on cornells campus and is some of the best food available. Sushirito's their specialty  are large full of fillings and do not overwhelm you with too much rice making them absolutely delicious. As well the staff have always been extremely friendly to me and always will to hold a conversation if not busy.\n" u"So this truck serves sushi burritos which is essentially just large sushi that hasn't been cut. Sort of a gimmick but a fun idea and perhaps easier to eat on the go. The sushi is only OK but I'm also from Vancouver so I have super high standards. A little on the pricey side.\n" u'I was soooo excited to try this place (food truck). My boyfriend and I each ordered the sushirito and salad. Within 24 hours we both had the runs. Moral of the story- pass on food truck sushi\n' u'Sushirrito...enough reason to venture out and look for the bright orange truck with no name.  Something tells me that they like to remain elusive and obscure.  That\'s How I Roll is the Easter egg of food trucks.\n\nThey were scheduled to served at the Finger Lakes Riesling and Craft Beer Festival 8/8-8/9. So naturally I had my lunch plans made after drinking delishiz nectar of life.  They were stationed at the Canandagua Lake Pier with the rest of the trucks.  How happy I was when I found it.  One would\'ve thought I caught Santa enjoying cookies and milk.  \n\nI asked the chefs what the most popular sushirritos were and naturally my friend and I ordered the top two they recommended.  I went with the "Out of Control Roll" which contained spicy salmon shrimp tempura avocado cucumber kani (crab salad) and spicy mayo.  The rice was very well seasoned as it SHOULD be. The roll was very sturdy and tasty.  Nothing like being able to hold a giant sushi roll and eat it on the go!  I only wish mine had a bit more mayo.  But other than that I am a fan!\n' u"Ever since I hear about sushiritos (sushi burritos) I have been dying to try one. Honestly they're just like glorified hand rolls with more stuff or giant sushi rolls that haven't been sliced. But that doesn't make it any less exciting! Basically every burrito has kani in it which I don't really care for but otherwise really good just pretty hard to eat. I tried the Three Amigos and the Out of Control. The Three Amigos was really good I just wish it had more pickled daikon in it. That would have been a really nice extra crunch! The Out of Control was also really good but a little too spicy for me but that's probably because I'm a wimp.\n\nSide note I tried dipping the sushirito in soy sauce but that made it super hard to eat because things were falling out so pro tip: take the soy sauce packet and drizzle it on!\n" u'I have been coming here for a few months now and it has always been great. The burritos are very filling and satisfying. My personal favorite is the "out of control" but I really like the spicy tuna lover and scorpion king as well. Although they do accept credit/debit just know that they prefer cash. it\'s definitely worth trying out!\n' u'PROS:\nVery creative maki sushi rolls served out of a truck. They have your standard veggie salmon and spicy tuna rolls etc. but the really unique items they make are their "sushi burritos". Basically what they call a sushi burrito is just a large maki sushi roll that is un-cut (no not that kind of un-cut ... you have a dirty mind ... think a hand roll just rolled into a tube rather than a cone). They stuff them with a ton of ingredients which creates unique flavor combinations that you really can\'t find at a traditional sushi establishment. The sushi burrito I got had tempura spicy salmon avocado cucumber crab and a bit more ingredients which I do not remember. It was probably better than any of the sushi places in Ithaca. The soy sauce packets that accompany their sushi seem to have added sugar in them (I think many people will find that this improves the taste but I prefer my soy sauce without sugar). They don\'t do nigiri here and I think this is a good thing. The nigiri at most Ithaca sushi places is awful this place is strictly maki sushi and it does it rather well.\n\nCONS:\nThey move frequently and do not have a website facebook page or twitter handle (at least after searching several times on google) to notify customers as to their current location. So this isn\'t a place you plan on going to it\'s more like a place you happen to stumble into randomly. Two common spots they seem to frequent is Stewart & Williams (near the remnant of the chapter house) and a few blocks away from Louie\'s lunch on North Campus. I\'ve walked by an empty parking spot in both of these locations during their supposed business hours many times which is quite frustrating. A mini burrito costs $7 and a regular burrito costs $12. I think a complete dinner\'s worth of sushi rolls will set you back $20 if you are reasonably hungry so this place really isn\'t much cheaper than the sit down sushi restaurants around ithaca despite working out of a truck. The burittos do not come with pickled ginger or wasabi unlike the traditional rolls.\n' u"Very tasty sushirritos! I was skeptical at first because I'm usually a huge sushi purist but every single bite of my sushirrito was delicious and filled with flavor. I like that they are willing to customize your order to your liking and the sushirrito comes fast and efficient. The flavors are awesome and the ingredients are fresh (and hot if you order something cooked). They do serve your standard sushi rolls as well but I think the star is the easy-to-hold easy-to-eat sushirrito. Absolutely delicious. A nice healthy and quick meal for lunch (though it's a little on the pricey side: 12$ for one sushirrito.)\n\nOnly downside is that it is pretty unpredictable where the truck will be. They have a facebook page now but it can be a little tricky to track them down. Once school starts again at Cornell they will probably be near campus serving the hungry masses.\n" u"Delicious and fast. Some of the vest food truck eats I've had in Ithaca. Woepa is very good at what he does.\n" u'Really loved these rolls! I ate 2 different kinds of rolls and they were both delicious. Very easy to eat and fresh.\n']
205.Subway,[u'only one person serves and coffee is empty...  when i ordered online I want my sandwitch double toasted but it didnt\n' u'This place f***ing sucks literally one dude working. Three people in the line and it took 20 minutes for my friend to begin to order his sandwich. BEGIN. 10/10 would NOT recommend.\n']
57.Sticky Rice Thai & Laotian Cuisine,[u"Really 3.7 stars.  One four star dish - cassia leave tofu one two star - pad see ew.  Pad see ew way too greasy with clumped noodles lacking flavor.  Cassia leave - think earthy gravy umami different and good.  Purple rice perfect.  I'd come back and try another dish for sure!\n\nPS they cleaned the light switch.\n" u"Yes it may not be the fanciest place but the Laotian food is SO delicious! I've ordered the catfish in coconut milk dish (forget exactly what it's called but it's flavored with dill & served in a banana leaf) and it's great. I've also had their thai curries which are also satisfying. One thing that you MUST get when you go here is the purple sticky rice. Even with the thai curries I always order the purple rice. You won't regret it! My husband has tried their laab moo (ground pork) and it's super flavorful but also fresh-tasting since it's served on/with lettuce. Very spicy though so be aware! He also always gets their beef jerky - it's not regular beef jerky but SUPER crunchy & sweet pieces of beef. Really amazing and unique.\n\nThe restaurant is also BYOB so be sure to take advantage of that. Yum!\n" u"Some of the most authentic Thai/Laotian food I've had in the US. Would definitely bring friends and family here - food always exceeds expectations and is top-notch for what you pay for. So delicious and hearty!\n" u'I ordered fried rice and spring rolls. The spring rolls were fine but the rice was awful. It just tasted like someone threw soy sauce on some wet rice and threw in some bok choy. It was not a good experience.\n' u'a major NO for Thai food. I order mild Thai pad see ewe almost every restaurant I go to and have had a great experience. here however the mild was totally bland. we also ordered stir fry beef and fried rice. something was definitely off because the rice seemed old and maybe just reheated. I got major food poisoning and was sick for almost a week.\n' u'Delivery is delicious and very authentic would def order again :) also food came half an hour before the expected time\n' u'Ordered small delivery order - took them an entire hour to call and tell us that they were out of chicken wings. After they still took another 40 mins the curry puffs were soggy and cold and they forgot part of the order. The little that was there tasted good but not enough to wait an hour and 40 mins for it to arrive cold.\n' u"There are so many (probably too many) Asian restaurants in Ithaca but Sticky Rice is definitely one of my favorites. It's a hole in the wall but if you judge the place on food alone it's great.\n" u"Not bad...\n\nOn a recent visit to Ithaca we had our dog in tow so we did takeout for dinner a few times. We decided to give Sticky Rice a try and ordered the papaya salad with purple rice and the chicken in banana leaf with white rice.\n\nWe went to pick up our order and I have to say I would never eat in here. The place is kind of grimy had a weird sour and dirty grease smell and there was a giant cricket sitting on the window.\n\nHowever the food was pretty good. We loved the sticky rice. The papaya salad wasn't anything to write home about but it was pretty fresh and added a much needed crunch to the meal. The chicken in the banana leaf was a hit. The creamy coconut milk and spices were delicious and the chicken was tender.\n\nOverall this place isn't at the top of my list but the food might warrant a visit here and there.\n" u'AH-MAY-ZING!\n\nWow. just fantastic cuisine.\n' u"Just ordered from here for the second time. Ordered:\n\n* 2 orders of spring rolls \n* 1 order of fresh roll with tofu \n* Tom Kha with tofu \n* Rice vermicelli with tofu\n* yellow curry with tofu (selected extra vegetables for $1.50).\n\nI order the same things from Taste of Thai express and this came out more than $10 more both times. \n\nOrdered through grubhub. That was the easiest and quickest online ordering I have ever done. Will go to them from now on for delivery.\n\nOrder arrived 20 minutes earlier than expected. Everything was piping hot.\n\nEverything ordered was there and neatly packed up. \n\nI was disappointed when I lifted the lids to see the entrees. The portion is smaller though more expensive than what we are used to from Taste of Thai express. Also the vegetables were just green onions bok choy (or something similar) and a few pieces of thinly sliced broccoli stems (no florets). No extra veggies as requested. The tofu was sparse...like a few chunks in each dish...and was also just raw tofu that got smooshed and fell apart in the dish. The rice vermicelli noodles were not vermicelli. It was a different kind of rice noodle and was seriously overcooked and mushy. Dangit! \n\nI was happy that the spring rolls were so cheap! For $2.95 you get two fried rolls that are larger than typical. I ordered two orders thinking they would be puny or there would only be one for that price. Pleasant surprise :)\n\nThe fresh roll was an enormous super plump roll. I've never seen a fresh roll that huge. It had mushrooms in it which I don't think helped it and created a weird mushy texture. But the roll was good enough. Worth the price. They are not good for sharing as cutting the monstrosity in half causes the contents to spill out. Get one for each person eating.\n\nThe Tom kha (a favorite in my family) is not good here. It's bland and they use the same veggies...green onion Asian greens thin sliced broccoli stems. It does not have the special spicy sweet notes that make Tom kha so awesome. \n\nThe actual flavor of the entrees was nice- but both were exactly the same (flavor wise). I find taste of Thai curries too sweet so this was a pleasant change.\n\nStrange to see so many mention the food being too spicy. I ordered medium and it was not spicy. \n\nThe extra star is for prompt and orderly delivery and the good cheap appetizers.\n\nNot likely to order from here again unfortunately.\n" u'Absolutely delicious! Nice blends of aroma of all kinds of herbs. Meat and fish were cooked to the perfect tenderness. Not greasy or over-sweet like most of Americanized Asian food. This will be our to-go restaurant list in Ithaca!\n' u"With the sticky rice desserts being the highlights it's easy to overlook their main courses which are incredibly flavorful and unique tasting.  If I ever return to Ithaca this place is #1 on my list of places to eat at.\n" u'I wish I found it earlier! I tried pad Thai and chilli and garlic fish and they are so delicious. Also the size of dishes are more than others in Ithaca. The mango sticky rice is also a good choice for dessert.\n' u'I ordered for the pad Thai (chicken) and spring roll.\nThe taste was good. The portion size seemed too less for the price.\nLanded up being one very expensive dinner for the quantity and taste. \nOverall its okay. May not order again.\n' u"Incredibly tasty Thai and Laotian food. The food is authentic and they make it as spicy as you want. This is by far my favorite place to get Thai and Laotian food in Ithaca. Though it's hard for me to pick favorites I really love the Laab moo the papaya salad Laotian crispy rice and all of their curries. Oh and the mango sticky rice for dessert is amazing. They've also been updating the restaurant repainting/decorations and I've been told more menu items and lunch hours. The owner and staff are wonderful very friendly people.\n\nIn addition to tasty food as a graduate student I appreciate it being more on the affordable side when compared to some other places in/around the commons. In the past I found sometimes service can be slow I recommend picking up your order as opposed to delivery. Atmosphere may not be fancy enough for some but the food is difficult to beat.\n" u'Delivery service is awful.  Called for an order and they could not give me an estimated time for delivery. I waited for two hours and I was starting by the time the cold food arrived. I do not recommend for delivery at all.  Really disappointed\n' u'Wife got the pad Thai which was standard.  Nothing to rave about but nothing to write a negative review.  I got the sausage with the purple rice. The rice was obviously sticky and crunchy. First time have rice cooked like that and was very good.  The sausage was too salty and very tough. I was okay with the food.  Although customer service was great. The owner was very attentive with all the customers.\n' u'For a place that\'s a total whole-in-the-wall restaurant this place gets a lot of business. It\'s on the backside of a building where it is not visible from the street and you would only find it by following signs which aren\'t really prominent enough to draw your attention. The interior may seem a bit janky but that\'s what you kinda expect with places like this.\n\nIt\'s a pretty small place so I wouldn\'t recommend it for big groups. We had a party of eight and they were unable to seat us together because there was already another group using the big table so we had to split into two tables on opposite sides of the restaurant.\n\nUpon sitting down the waitress told us that it would take at least 20-25 minutes to get our food. Probably not something you would want to be told within your first few minutes inside the restaurant but we decided to stay anyway. Lots of people ordered on the phone and picked them up instead so that might be a better option.\n\nThai iced tea is HUGE here. They basically give you a giant glass mug meant for beers. They\'re so tall that the straws they give you will be completely submerged. It\'s only $3 so it\'s a great deal compared to other places.\n\nEvery dish is in the range of $10 to $14. Common dishes like pad thai and pad se-ew were in that range too so don\'t expect them to be any cheaper than the "fancier" dishes. I ordered something from the barbecue page and I was told 20 minutes later that my dish was not available and I would need to pick something else. I just asked for the same thing as one of my friends. Surprisingly it came out almost immediately after that so perhaps their kitchen sped up. It still would have been better if they were more aware of what was available from their menu so I didn\'t have to be told my dish was unavailable 20 minutes later.\n\nThe food itself was pretty good but the size doesn\'t justify the cost except for the iced tea. Service was friendly but they should have been more efficient.\n' u'Excellent variety. Wonderful flavored. Owner was so very helpful getting our spicing level right and getting rid of cilantro. Coconut soup is so creamy and full of flavor. Peanut sauce is super with a nice salad. Beef barbecue was a little spicy but so good. Fried rice had lots of veggies. Thai beef salad so full of flavors. And the sticky rice sides are very sticky.\n']
2.Mercato Bar & Kitchen,[u'Wonderful food and service. Me and my SO visited for a special occasion and when the host found out were given free prosecco. Having been to Italy a few times I can say that the food was authentic and delicious.\n' u"This was a good option for a cold winter night.  A little after 9:00 on a Saturday we had a choice of just about any table.  \n\nBegan with the chacuterie plate.  It included a hunter's sausage prosciutto soprasetta and copa along with some hunks of Gorgonzola Parmesan chunks and slices of young pecorino with peppercorns.  It was fairly substantial and plenty as an appetizer for two. \n\nThe oso bucco was a large shank of flavorful braised pork in a rich sauce over polenta.   It worked very well.  The gnocchi with an oxtail ragu was very well made - the gnocchi were light and airy and the ragu was just rich enough and the meat delicious. \n\nThe five wines by the glass were all Italian.  The Primitivo was our favorite and the Etna Rosso was also quite good.\n" u'The food here was good but not great. I had a butternut squash soup clams casino and a buckwheat pasta with pulled rabbit. They were all a bit overpriced and under-seasoned for my pallet; but still good. I did love that they had a good selection of unique food as that is always what I prefer. However if I go back to this area for dinner I would choose Just a Taste over Mercato.\n' u'This is a very easy restaurant to rate 5 stars and based on my overall experience here last month I would probably give them a (rare for me) 6 if I could.\n\nThey hit a grand slam home run in all respcts.\xa0 And they hit a home run in my nieces eyes.\xa0 She loved it!\xa0 They exceeded all my expectations.\xa0 I have not had a better food and service combo anywhere. \n\nOur first times here I researched out this place to take my niece for a graduation celebration dinner as soon as I got off my jet at Tompkins Airport.\xa0 We were here on a Weds night for over 2.5 hours.\xa0 They did not rush us.\xa0 The atmosphere was perfect for catching up celebrating\xa0 laughing and just enjoying life.\n\nService was the best I have ever encountered.\xa0 The wait staff had great communicstion worked as a team and were able to sense our pace and adjust to it and accomodate and answer questions as experts on the dishes. \n\nThe food was best in class.\xa0 Here is the roundup:\n\nMartini:\xa0 She said it was excellent.\nMy Ithaca Beer Co beer: Great\nTable bread: 5 of 5\nSoup: Perfect.\nParchment Fish with Fingerling Potatoes and Spinach: Easy 5--I could eat this every day.\nScallops: 7 of 5.\xa0 You read it right.\xa0 These are the best Scallops you will ever have naturally sweet tender fresh.\xa0 If you order scallops in restaurants they will only taste as great as these 1 out of 15 times. \nFor desert we had the house favorite also very good.\n\nTotal bill without tax and tip for drinks appetizer dinners desert: $90.00\n\nIf this fits in your budget check this place out.\n\nI will again next time in town.\xa0 Wish there was one in Cali near me. Restaurants in Beverly Hills would have a hard time competing with Mercato.\n' u"It was very quiet on a Wednesday night so we got right in with a party of three even though they don't take reservations\n\nWe started with a watercress salad and the crostini sampler. The crostinis were meh the mortadella was the best one but the fig and goat cheese crostini lacked any flavor of goat cheese and ended up tasting like an elevated Fig Newton.\n\nI ordered the scallops with pur\xe9ed carrots and mushrooms. The scallops were beautiful and perfectly cooked but didn't really feel like a cohesive dish. They were also served lukewarm which was unfortunate because it led to the last few scallops being cold and rubbery. I also am not a huge fan of the shoestring fries so I got green beans instead and they were quite good but simple.\n\nIt was a pleasant meal and the service was good but for $32 for five scallops I want to be blown away and served scallops that aren't lukewarm.\n" u"The great:\n\nThe food was outstanding.  We had the chicken saltimbocca hanger steak and the cheese plate.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  It was one of the best meals I've had in recent memory.\n\nThe server was extremely helpful.  They didn't have Pinot Grigio on the menu so the server made a couple of recommendations for my wife.  She was pleased with the options.\n\nThe okay :\n\nBathrooms are in sort of an awkward spot and are cramped.  Food took a little longer than most places.\n" u'Our 2nd time here and just as good. Wonderful bartenders with wonderfully flavored cocktails. Clams casino arugula salad meat and cheese plate all great choices for apps. Then fettuccine with clams sausage ravioli gnocchi with eggplant swordfish in parchment and seared scallops. \n\nWow. All flavored to perfection. And service to match. \n\nOn the pricey side but worth it.  And Rolling Stones music all night. What more could I want?!\n' u"What a an amazing experience! We went here on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday they don't accept reservations which was fine so we took the last seat at the bar and settled in.  The bartender was friendly and warm. Instead of just handing me a drink menu he asked me what types of drinks I like and made a special drink for me- and it was divine!! The attention to detail and the bartender's craft into making this cocktail was superb! I was slightly saddened when our table was ready because I wouldn't get to see their drink making skills anymore! :)\n\nWe sat down and had great table service she was warm knowledgeable and never tried to rush us.  We started with their clams casino appetizer (a yelp recommendation) and they were yummy! We moved on to dinner and got the hanger steak (which was much review on yelp as well) and I the buckwheat papperdelle with duck ragu (sounds weird but it was fabulous) both were so good!! I would eat that duck pasta daily if I could. The quality of the meal was so good and we paired it with a good bottle of red wine.\n\nOverall I'd say go! The drinks and food are good and it was just a great evening.\n" u'Went here for dinner on an anniversary trip. The cocktails were inventive and strong...always a bonus. The salad should be skipped...it was lettuce with 2 tomatoes and very light dressing for $6...eh. I had the gnocchi with short rib ragu which was flavorful and gnocchis were soft and delicate as they should be. My boyfriend chose the hanger steak which was cooked perfectly. Service was average although nice and welcoming. Overall a good experience the only down side was a short menu.\n' u'Great ambiance really enjoy the food the selection on their meat and cheese plate is amazing. You cant tell that the pasta is fresh.\n' u"Good Italian fare great service and nice outdoor seating. Small so be ready to sit on top of your neighbor as it only has 12 tables inside and 4 outside. Drinks were nice and sweet just like i like em! We started off with corn and crab soup and some liverworst pate on a crustini with pickled red onions. Loved it! However I'm used to corn and crab soup being thick like chowder with nice lump crab pieces this was pretty soupy and only had tiny crab pieces still good but could have been better.\n\nI ordered the scallops with corn and favor beans very good. The scallops were meaty and seared well and the rest were fresh and tasty. My boyfriend ordered the arctic char (oh so meaty fleshy and light tasting) with fingerling potatoes and perfectly julienned veggies! Very healthy light and tasty dishes!\n\nFinally we ended off with buttermilk pie and panna cotta.\n\nTo conclude this was a nice dining experience. Food is pretty good but nothing amazing and because of that. do think it was a bit too pricey for the portion sizes and overall taste. \n\nThere are more authentic Italian places in Ithaca like Gola Osteria with its handmade and housemade pastas and bread on site for a fraction of the cost.\n" u"Excellent!\n\nLittle brother made reservations for the family for graduation dinner. We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and were seated almost immediately which was great. Menus were brought out with the quickness and we settled in. Bread with some olives infused and butter was served with waters while we skimmed out menus. Off to a great start. \n\nAnd the great start would continue. We ordered our wines and drinks and they came out almost immediately. Server was very accommodating to my mom's request for more grapefruit juice with her mimosa. Here we were happy to discover my husband's new favorite IPA on tap: Ithaca flower power. Really good. Ordered myself a glass of the vignalta merlot/cab sauv blend which was also pleasant. My brother ordered a siren song (if my memory serves me right) which was gin with cucumber and something else. It was pretty good!\n\nHad 3 appetizers to start all three of which were incredible. We ordered a charcuterie plate the chicken liver and pickled onion app and clams casino. Recommend all the. The charcuterie plate came with 2 different kids of prosciutto pork shoulder and salami along with a cup of deliciously marinated olives and 3 kinds of cheese - a goat cheese Gorgonzola and Parmesan. This went really well with my wine. Chicken liver pate on sourdough bread with red pickled onions was amazing. Clams casino delicious with peppers on top of each open clam. \n\nEntrees: \nScallops - perfectly cooked on a bed of yummy greens. Came with half a dozen. \n\nVeal chop - first time it came more medium than desired. Waiter took it back without hesitation. The medium rare re-fire was well worth the 20 min wait. My brother literally picked up the t-bone and ate it clean. He substituted the fingerling potatoes for the shoestring fries. Seasonal veggie that day was asparagus cooked with balsamic topped with Parmesan which was also delicious. \n\nPaccheri with sausage - this pasta dish was cooked in a white cream Parmesan sauce with ground sausage. So incredibly flavorful and pasta was the perfect al dente. Husband mopped up the remainder sauce with some bread. \n\nMy hangar steak - perfect perfect red of medium rare sliced into nice bite size squares. Paired with a handful of shoestring fries and asparagus. Very pleased. Not to be biased or anything but yeah my dish was the best. \n\nDessert - affogato : a cup of hot espresso poured onto generous scoops of vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect ending to a very delicious dinner for an even happier occasion. \n\nThe likelihood of my returning to Ithaca is slim to none but if I ever do go back mercado will be a dining stop for sure.\n" u"This restaurant is a great addition to Ithaca's food scene. We went here recently on a weeknight and had a really great meal. The veal chop and the chicken piccata were prepared well and presented in an attractive way. \n\nThey also had some great dessert options - the buttermilk pie was a surprise but a good one. The crust was very well-made and the pie itself had good flavor and was not too sweet. \n\nStaff were friendly and checked in when appropriate. Service felt more casual than at some higher-end restaurants but that could be because we went on a less busy weekday or it could just be their style. Either way it felt appropriate for the restaurant. \n\nDefinitely recommend!\n" u"This place has a great attention to detail with matched superior service. Their cocktail menu is impressive and they were willing to exchange out any that we didn't appease us. They also were willing to modify the cocktails a bit to suit each person's preference. \n\nI had the arugula salad with goat cheese fennel and a lemon vinaigrette. For my main course I had the pan roasted chicken which was one of the most tender and perfectly moistened pieces I've ever had. It was supplemented with garlic leek capers and a white wine to add to the flavor along with roasted potatoes that were perfectly finished. \n\nThe service was awesome and our waitress clearly wanted to make sure we were happy with our selections. I appreciated that the bartender was willing to work his magic and modify the cocktails at the suggestion of the customers. Overall this place certainly lives up to its reputation.\n" u"Update: Visited for the 2nd time on August 25th. Still fabulous. I want to live upstairs from this place.\n\n==========================================================\n\nThis is actually a 5 star restaurant or even 6 stars but I'm giving it 2 in order to get management's attention about just one issue: the music. We were there last night (Saturday) around 6:00 PM - a very busy time obviously. The place is small and the tables are close together so just the other conversations around us were noisy (which is normal). But the music raised the noise level to the point where we had trouble conversing at times. I'm a musician. I love music. But in certain environments it serves absolutely no purpose except to allow restaurant owners to wallow around in an unfortunate delusion.\n\nNow for the good part: Everything else about this place is fabulous. Or waiter was very professional and his timing was excellent. My companion had mint pappardelle with lamb ragu and I had spinach & cheese ravioli with oven roasted tomato sauce. Both dishes were absolutely beautiful and portion sizes were perfect. If we'd had more time we would've tried one or two of the appetizers but we were slightly rushed to get to a concert.\n\nThis is the kind of place you keep coming back to because you fall in love with some of the dishes. Congratulations owners. Just tone down the music when it's busy.\n" u'Solid well-presented tasty dinner here.\n\nStarted off a bit on the shaky side with a "sparkling blue moon" cocktail that skewed too sour but smoother sailing after that.\n\nCrostini with roasted peppers and anchovies made for a nice starter and my saut\xe9ed bone-in chicken (with leeks artichokes rosemary white wine & fingerling potatoes) was juicy tender and flavorful. Dining companions enjoyed their straw & hay pasta and pork Milanese with arugula & tomatoes.\n\nWarm golden-lit ambiance with an open kitchen attractive bar and great service from our smiling low-key waitress. I\'d go back.\n' u"The most AMAZING meal I have had in a very long time. Great portions great flavors this restaurant makes basic dishes.. OUTSTANDING!! We got the fettuccini with clams the fish of the day and the gnocchi & they were all impeccable. Drinks were also to die for!! And service was great as well. Can't say a bad thing about it!\n" u'This might be one of my fav restaurants in Ithaca. I prefer it to the French place next door. Its a small joint with close "neighborly" tables. You get to know your neighbors and I have often suggested food items to them! Overall the drinks are really good and the food specials are worth the prices. \n\nSpeaking about prices this isn\'t a cheap place and you can easily spend $50pp BUT I find it worth it. The crostini sampler is a must have for me (love the chicken liver crostimi) and I suggest you try any pasta special they have on the menu. If unsure ask the server for help.\n\nI love their scallops and piccata. The papardelle is a hit as well. Generous portions and attentive service. It\'s a great date night spot or when you want to enjoy a nice dinner. But as others have said it can get loud so don\'t expect soft musoc and roses! Enjoy.\n' u"Our entrance was the first disappointment. Granted when we were approached my first question was about a restroom but the tone and comment we recieved along the lines of....ignoring my question and just asking if we would be dining there was uncomfortable.  Our waitress on the other hand was very nice. We ordered the  \n\nChicken liver & pickled red onion crostini roasted with onion & bay leaf blended with dark rum. The consistency of the liver was not quite mealy or gritty but not at all smooth not at all moist not at all the buttery consistency chicken liver can have. The taste was a bit sulphuric and metalic.\n\nButternut squash ravioli brown butter sage mascarpone parmigiano. The ravioli was decent they were certainly not worth the over $3 a piece that they are priced at when you do the math. They seemed to be served in more of a light broth than a rich brown butter. \n\nCaramel - espresso pot de creme homemade graham cracker whipped cream was the last item. It was the shining star of the evening. The texture was awesome like a sought after pillow at the end of a hard day. The lightly salted graham put the gold star stamp on it. Unfortunately the dessert didn't save the whole experience.\n" u'A hotelie friend recommended me this place. The Crostini Sampler was lovely. I liked the scallops a delicious choice for a person that is on diet XD. I recommended a friend the veal chop which he absolutely loved! I was considering this place for a graduation dinner but unfortunately it was too small. A nice atmosphere for a date though.\n']
176.Friendly‚Äôs,[u"Friendly's on Triphammer always surpasses our expectations -- on cool variety total fun and genuine caring  service.\n\nMy wife is a chef from Le Cordon Bleu in Paris but with 3 girls under 10 years old sometime you just want fun.  This places seals the deal.\n\nIf you want candles and $30 entrees the Heights Grill is 1 mile away and John Thomas is about 7.  But that's not any of us come to Friendly's.\n\nThis is fun tasty non-elitest surprises.  \n\nMy 2-3 dinners on the road each week are usually $50+ but no lunch is as fun and wonderful than eating at Friendly's with my daughters as they drink low-fat mile from a curly straw eat miniature cheeseburger sliders and eat a mini-monster sundae.  \n\nI first  learned about Friendly's when I was a single Professor at Dartmouth.  My acid test as to whether someone was worth dating was whether they had fun if we went to Friendly's.\n" u'Good food. Good service. Excellent ice cream! Only complaint is that this location is in need of some TLC. A minor renovation is in order especially the carpet. You can smell it if your seated in the area with carpet it is really off putting. At the very eat rip up the carpet and give the interior a fresh coat of paint.\n' u"Visited for breakfast while our daughter did her college tour and placement exam the local college (we're from nyc). Took the hostess a minute to greet us and seat us. The restaurant smelled like bleach rags. I know because I worked in a restaurant before! We had a booth which was sticky and had crumbs on the floor but this was the closest place for breakfast and we were starving. Our waitress was very sweet and prompt. She was really busy and seemed to be the only server at that hour (11am). I had eggs and fruit. Tasted fine. And lots of coffee. The other half had the triple slam (I think that's the name?) and seemed satisfied. Nothing remarkable at all about the meal or service. Won't go again when we visit there later this summer.\n" u"Disclosure: This is from awhile back. Also I've never given a 1-star rating or walked out of a restaurant. \n\nMy family arrived 2 hours prior to closing and there were 4 tables with customers. There were at least 4 women working out front and 1 working in back. We walked in and made eye contact with them. Not a single 'hi' 'hello' or smile. We stood there awkwardly and decided to seat ourselves after a while. No one acknowledged us for 5 minutes so we got the menus ourselves. Another 5-10 minutes went by without acknowledgement. As I was getting ready to ask them to take our order another customer went up to the counter expressing her frustration with their horrible service. Apparently she just wanted to get ice cream for her toddler and pay her bill but they kept putting her off. At that point we decided to leave for another restaurant. Again no acknowledgment. Worst customer service I've ever experience. If I had behaved that way at my last job (at a restaurant) I would have been fired. This was a pathetic excuse for a dining establishment.\n" u'This establishment perhaps deserves 2 stars for the simple fact that my experience there has since been a great "horrible customer service" story to tell at parties.\n\nWe went there to celebrate something - I think it was the end of the semester in high school - and just wanted some ice cream cones. They have a window where you stand outside if you want something simple like ice cream. Fast right?\n\nNope. There was a line maybe 3 or 4 deep and after 20 minutes they hadn\'t gotten to us. Truly incredible. There were a few spells where no one was at the window (where the ice cream was) at all.\n\nWe decided we were going to be better off going inside and sitting down for a sundae. Awful decision. We ordered our ice cream and waited another 25 minutes for them to come.\n\nLong story short 45 minutes+ to get an ice cream code. Laughable experience.\n\nAnd it wasn\'t that good.\n' u"While service isn't the best the waiters & waitresses are friendly and try hard. I believe they need to hire at least one more wait staff which makes it management's severe problem not the wait staff's! \n\nHowever I do have to say on the positive side the ice cream menu is to die for!! Their ice cream is delicious!!\n" u'Slow service bad build-your-own hamburger. Even 3 pieces of pickles charge for $0.39. Only three pieces! Taste no better than Mcdonalds.\n' u'Horrible waited 10 min and no one ever came to table for drink or food order. There were three staff who were all too preoccupied to check on any of the customers. To hell with this place.\n' u'Usually rate Friendlies as an upscale diner but was pleasantly surprised by the Pastrami Swiss sandwich today. Looking forward to trying other meat sandwiches like Reuben. Service is slack but the waitresses are nice just not the most efficient so patience is a virtue.\n']
104.Plum Tree Restaurant,[u"My wife and daughter love this place. We've been there numerous times over the years. My wife and daughter usually have a bento box each and always enjoy it. I always have a large sashimi plate which is always good but not outstanding for the price. It's worth a try if you like sushi or sashimi.\n" u"Pretty mediocre sushi in the heart of Collegetown. Definitely not a place for an extravagant meal or date but hits the spot for sake bombs and cheap dinner with a large group. At $10 per the sake bombs are a pretty decent deal. Some favorites for dinner include the chicken katsu and the fried rice which at under $10 each make for a cheap dinner. The dinner bento boxes are pricey but can be easily shared between two people if you aren't too hungry and I believe they're about half price at lunch.\n\nService is reliably average and the restaurant is consistently clean. Typically never a problem getting a table without a reservation but periodically there will be a date night or event at Plum Tree that makes it difficult to get in on short notice especially with a large group. They have a sort of 'lofted' area to the restaurant where they usually seat larger parties. Can be loud on certain nights when there are large parties (usually Fridays or Saturdays at 8 ish).\n\nSplitting a check a bunch of ways can be kind of a nightmare at Plum Tree which is surprising because of how many large parties they do. It's usually easier to just have one person pay and collect from their friends on Venmo.\n\nAll in all places like Plum Tree are a dime a dozen in more metropolitan areas but it's one of the better places in Collegetown.\n" u"It's a good place to get fast Japanese food between classes. Lunch boxes are good cheap and quick. I wouldn't suggest the salmon sashimi since the quality varies a lot each time I visited there. It does not worth the price.\n" u"Unfortunately am basing this on ambiance service and their miso soup. I wasn't too hungry but my friend was so we thought we'd stop in for a bit. He got a salad that he enjoyed it had rice tons of fishes in it. I got to try the miso and it was nicely flavored but barely any seaweed or tofu. The atmosphere was fun it was huge! Lots of college students there being rambunctious. The music was top 40. It was decorated like a sushi place but the vibe was definitely American.\n" u'Plum. The first place i ever had sushi... I was very happy I dared to. Delicious!\n\neverything was good even the seaweed salad. Good service and good food.\n\nCollege town sake bombs\nEnough said\n' u"3.5 stars.\n\nI feel a little bad about giving 3 stars. I enjoyed my meal here it's just the food really didn't quite make the 4 star standard.\n\nFirst of all overpriced for what they offer. Prices are comparable to similar joints in NYC but not quite as up to par in terms of quality.\n\nSome tables were not set and there is the occasional fly. Service is polite and food comes out pretty quickly. \n\nThe special rolls here are delicious. There are many creative choices to choose from and most of them are illustrated in the menu. They're not loaded with rice and are generously filled with fish and veggies-very satisfying.\n\nNow the raw fish: not very fresh. Though subtle the sashimi all had a slightly fishy and unpleasant aftertaste. All were soft and flimsy to the touch instead of firm so texture was also not amazing. Good news: they do give you pretty big slices but in this case I'd rather pay more for fresher sushi. \n\nI'd recommend coming here for lunch as their lunch special bento boxes are a great value at 9.95. Their cooked food (teriyaki skewers) are actually pretty good. Definitely a fun place to go sake bombing with friends- very crowded and loud at night.\n" u"Popped in here for a quick lunch. Got the bento lunch special which everyone in the restaurant also seemed to be having. Had the chicken teriyaki bento box. The chicken was disappointing as it wasn't grilled and seemed to just be strips of chicken heated in the sauce. Everything else including the salad California roll and gyoza were standard. Decent amount of food but felt the price was only okay for the quality. Not sure why their bento boxes are so popular.\n" u'Pretty high prices but I guess normal for collegetown. Pretty good quality sushi possibly best in ithaca\n' u"One of my favorite places in college town. I like the soba noodle Kalbi lunch box dragon roll etc when I'm eating alone. And it's always more fun with a group. The sushi boat and saki bomb are amazing when you have a group. It's good for a lunch alone and a group dinner on Friday night. Besides all the food on the menu are tasty. It's not first class but you'll never get anything taste wrong. =)\n" u"As a lover of Japanese food and an undergrad at Cornell for the past four years I have eaten at Plum Tree a lot probably over fifty times. Not because it is an amazing restaurant but out of desperation as it is by far the best in the Cornell area that one can get to without a car. Plum Tree has OK food. It certainly hits the spot for any who are clamoring for yummy Japanese or Asian food such as katsu chicken takoyaki sashimi etc. One thing to note is that they have something called a Salmon Don which is a plate of only salmon sashimi (10 pieces) but it doesn't seem to be listed on the main menu only menus through Ithaca to Go and such. You can also switch out your salad for a miso soup if you want for free which is really nice. However none of the food is spectacular; most of the rolls are rather overpriced for the amount and quality you get the fish isn't fresh and on some days you may get large slices other days the portions may be very small. Also they overcharge but everywhere in Ithaca does this. \n\nThey do their best at hosting large parties and do seem to have a good system down pat for hosting large parties. However their waiters appear to have frequently struggled getting orders for large parties correct or even parties as little as 4 people...I can remember several times off the top of my head my waiter has brought the wrong thing and even suggested that I ordered something else. That said this usually all gets corrected as the manager is a wonderful lady who does try to do best by her customers. \n\nFor all the dissing I have just done of this restaurant it is a good place to take your family or hang out with your friends. But do not expect anything close to the quality of food you'd get in California or NYC for the price you will pay.\n" u'As a rule food in Ithaca is woefully disappointing and yes as many have noted overpriced. I think Plum Tree is one of the only places where you can get a decent meal for commensurate value. The sushi rolls are simple but fresh and well-prepared. My husband and I like to go there for a light meal; we typically share 2-3 rolls. $15 for dinner for two? Where else does this happen in Ithaca?\n' u"I've been to plum tree a few times and overall the quality is decent but a little overpriced.\n\n\nAppetizers:\nThe sake kama (grilled salmon collar) is really good grilled perfectly with nice char and cooked through but small and overpriced. \n\nThe takoyaki are fantastic! You're definitely going to burn your mouth on the inside. A little overpriced but super tasty\n\nThe soft shell crab is 2 crabs cut in half; kinda fried until it barely tastes like crab. I would not really recommend this.\n\nThere's an appetizer with squid in a ginger sauce that was really fairly priced and large; the squid was cooked perfectly too tender but still tasted like squid.\n\nMains:\nThe tonkatsu curry is decent the cutlet feels thin but it's fried well and not greasy. Not much to say about the curry. \n\nAll of the sushi entrees are pretty good quality taste good tastefully presented but generally overpriced. I've had the sashimi dinner and sashimi lovers dinner. All the fish were cut well and tasted fresh; nothing too fishy or tough.\n\nThe hwe dup bap was quite good; heavy on the small fish eggs and a little light on the fish chunks but can probably serve two people who aren't super hunger. Probably a better deal in terms of filling you up than the sashimi entrees.\n\nDessert:\nThe fried ice cream was downright terrible. Super thick coating very greasy. Icy crystals in the ice cream. The chocolate sauce completely overwhelmed the taste of the green tea ice cream of which there wasn't much to begin with.\n\n\n\nOverall though decent quality sushi and sashimi tastes pretty authentic. A little on the pricey side can get loud so think twice before coming here on a date.\n" u'Have tried Bento box with beef and kalbi. I have to say the sauce for Kalbi is too heavy flavored and makes me drink a lot of water. The price of the lunch Bento box is reasonable while in the evening the prices almost doubles with more food inside. The squid tastes good also the beef roll with asparagus.\n' u"Not amazing but a step up from Miyake.\n\nI came for lunch and got a bento box which tasted good although not as great as the bento box lunch specials you can get at the Korean restaurants in town which are cheaper and have more flavor in the meat.\n\nYou still get a crowd of sake bombers even in the middle of the day on a weekend but I guess that's what happens when there's nothing to do in Ithaca. It makes the place loud but it's not that disruptive.\n\nService is pretty good here. Waiters are pretty attentive so I didn't have to do anything to catch their attention. I guess when they don't have to cater to several groups of kids doing sake bombs they can actually cater to other customers.\n" u"this is a collegetown favorite and a place you would come to have a quality meal. By college standards this place is considered expensive. I have been here on multiple occasions. My family treated me to a nice dinner here freshmen year and I still enjoy it today as a Big Red alum. You can't go wrong with any item at this place. If you are hungry get the Bento Box. You will not be disappointed. I am not a big sushi person but the rolls here seem to be very good and fresh. Plus they can accommodate large groups! Treat yourself well college peeps!\n" u"This Japanese restaurant is supposedly the best around here. Why? Not sure. \n\nThe service was good and the speed of the food coming out was decent. \n\nI ordered the vegetable naruto and it was decent. How can it get bad? It's just sliced vegetables wrapped into a circle. But I do taste a difference btwn very good vegetable narutos and decent ones. What's the diff? Flavor. I guess it's how ripe their veggies are and how they decide to balance each veggie in the roll.\n" u'Service was a bit slow the Coke that I ordered tasted old and the sushi was just so so.\n' u'Good- sake bombing rice dishes\nStay away- sushi\nSushi in Ithaca is not good. I have stopped trying to eat it here altogether. Plum Tree is a fun place to go with friends for a night of sake bombing and a plate of fried rice but not much else.\n' u'My favorite sushi spot in Ithaca! Highly recommend the 007 roll and yaki udon.\n' u'Good restaurant. The edamame was cold and could have been saltier but the sushi and sashimi were delicious. Service could Be a but more attentive but overall good experience.\n']
126.Rogan‚Äôs Corner,[u"Rogan's is a total South Hill landmark. They don't necessarily have the world's most amazing pizza but they are the best source of pizza located immediately adjacent to Ithaca College (I actually dug Franco's sauce a little more)--- which means you're not going to spend 3 hours waiting for delivery. \n\nDelivery cut-off at Rogan's was one of those times that defined your existence like knowing when quiet hours were in effect what time they stopped serving breakfast in the Terrace dining hall on weekends and when last call was.\n\nTheir subs were also pretty good and it's a convenient place to get gas and beer.\n\nRogan's also provided the raw materials for one of the weirdest eating habits I ever acquired -- dipping the crust in the free Pepsi that came with the pizza. Picked that one up from a roommate's friend. Never done that anywhere else or any time since...\n" u'I am so disappointed. Rogans delivery time is generally slow. Today was the worse. I was told it would take 45 minutes to an hour. An hour and a half later I called. We were told we were the next order out the door. After two and a half hours I called to cancel and received no explanation for the hold up. I am not planning on ordering from here again.\n' u'Every time I find myself needing to be on South Hill I always tryto plan it around lunchtime so I have an excuse to have lunch at Rogans. Their sandwiches/subs are great. For those of you who are longtime Ithaca residents the sandwiches/subs are the menu from the old King Sub in the west end.  Big fan of the Eskimo and the King Midas. \n\nI think Rogans also has decent pizza not great bit good.  \nVery reasonably priced especially for lunch.\n' u'I had this thing called a slobberknocker there it was amazing. I need someone to post a picture of one.\n' u'I really wanted to like this place. It has a nice location up on south hill and if you eat outside the parking lot overlooks both Cayuga lake and Cornell a truly stunning view. \n\nI ordered the grilled chicken sandwich "to go" so I could eat outside and replenish all that vitamin D I lost during Ithaca\'s winter months. For $8 the sandwich was quite large a reasonable price point. The bread tasted fresh and the chicken was cooked very well. However when I opened the tinfoil wrapper I noticed that the sub was a hot soggy mess. This was especially strange because there was absolutely no sauce on the sub at all not even mayo or mustard. The warm sub must have sweated all over itself and the excess moisture smothered my sandwich. It was kind of gross. Its too bad because the chicken tasted fresh and the parts of the bread that I could salvage were equally good. The toppings were just OK: while the lettuce was crisp the tomatoes were kind of mushy and the sweet peppers were more bitter than sweet.\n\nMaybe next time I\'ll try their pizza.\n' u'I ordered food here today. This will be the last time. It took over an hour and a half for my subpar food to arrive and when it did finally get here it was cold. When I called the Restaurant I was placed on hold for over four minutes and still did not receive a satisfying reply to my concern that my food had not arrived yet in an hour and a half. I would not recommend this place and I will never be ordering again.\n' u'Good food good beer good service Tully burger needs to be changed back to the original\n' u'best sandwich spot in ithaca. i go at least 2x per week. would highly recommend. and they have $1 drafts all day long\n' u"I'm pretty happy to have Rogan's in my neighborhood. I just moved to this city and somehow having its doors open has made me feel more welcome. It's a pretty lively place with quite a few regulars that hang out at the dining area to chat with coffee or beer. They have a surprisingly extensive menu and serve generous portions. you should try one of Rogan's Heroes. I found their online ordering system to work great and their staff to be friendly. Overall I love this joint and I'm enjoying picking off their menu one item at a time.\n" u'THE WORST SANDWICH IVE EVER HAD! long time yelp reader and this place was so bad that i feel i have to make my first review. Literally DISGUSTING! i ordered the sandwich the far far away and it was inedible. Cold chicken cutlet that tasted like it was 3 days old with some of the lowest quality toppings ive ever seen. i took one bite spit it out and threw out the sandwich. as a senior at cornell i was hoping to find another good sandwich place in the area apart from the regular spots. from now on il stick to whats dependable and be sure to speak negatively of rogans corner to anyone who mentions it. GROSS - if i could give less than one star i would\n' u'Crappy service can\'t comment on the food. We were staying at the Hampton Inn and saw the tempting menu the family was starving and all psyched for the subs. Called to place the order and was put on hold for 10 minutes. Called back "Rogan\'s Corner please hold"  (said as if that was one word) *click* Hold for another 5 minutes. This happened a few more times. Finally called again and this time I talked very quickly over the "Rogan\'scornerpleasehold"....and asked her to please take a sandwich order for 4 standard subs and we would come to pick them up....*click*. Ok Panera it is...\n' u"The food is always great from Rogans.  I love their Philly's.\n" u'It took them 2 hours to deliver a cold sub and a salad. the sub was small and thrown together the bread was the generic kind you buy at the store.\n' u'Go to www.restaurant.com to save on future orders ... Awesome takeout food here ... Ask for the Mike Brained sub too !!!\n' u'There is not much to dislike about Rogans.  This place is awesome.  Dollar drafts for most of the day dollar slices on Mondays and awesome sandwiches.  I recommend the Bomber.  Food is great and they deliver (including beer).  Easy 5 star rating.\n' u"Sadly Rogan's is not what it used to be.  Back between 1988 and 1992 Rogan's was the place to go for pizza and wings and subs and beer.  It was ALWAYS busy.  I can't even tell you how many nights my friends and I ordered pizza and wings from Rogan's to help us get through a night of studying or to satisfy some late-night cravings.  \n\nWhen I was in Ithaca in the fall of 2006 Rogan's was CLOSED.  When I stopped to get a slice of pizza I was told that they were closed for renovations and had been sold to a new owner.  :(\n\nIn the summer of 2007 they were back open but it seemed like everything was missing.  The inside had changed.  It so wasn't what it used to be.  We didn't even order pizza or wings not sure if they even still had any.  We were really disappointed.  \n\nBut at least we have the memories....  LOL\n" u"Given that this is actually a gas station I know I should not have expected much but sometimes hole-in-the-wall places turn out to be the best.  This is not one of those places.  The food is edible but it is dirty and the people who work there are incredibly incredibly rude (The worst I've ever seen).  I would not recommend this place to anyone.\n" u"Rogans is the best! They have the best pizza I've ever had. There open really late and they have low delivery minimums so you can order dinner for one and still get food sent to your house. I love that you can also order things like beer candy soda ice cream milk and whatever groceries that you need and they will deliver it. Other than pizza they have great bread sticks salads and roast beef sandwiches.\n" u"I have to depart from my fellow reviewers here. I'm presently eating a pizza from Rogan's and all I can think about is Dominoes. Seriously greasy. Heavy oily cheese. I simply can't imagine having such strong positive reviews when nearly identical pizza is available mass produced in every town from coast to coast. There is way too much good pizza in this town to bother with this mess. I can't speak to the other menu items but the pizza was a big disappointment.\n" u'I sometimes dream of Rogans double dough pineapple and meatball pizzas along with fifty sweet wings. Eat the wings and then poor the extra juices from the wings on the pizza and add some bleu cheese. Its been a long time... Is Rogans still there?Anyone know their recipe for sweet wings?\n']
36.De Tasty Hot Pot,[u"Unassuming basement restaurant serving authentic Szechuan food. Excellent quality food with mediocre service and atmosphere. Recommended for lunch specials. (12/19/16)\n\nFood 5/5 | Atmosphere 2/5 | Service 3/5 | Value 4/5\nPros: Authentic flavors; great lunch special prices & portion sizes\nCons: Restaurant decor is closer to a nightclub than a restaurant; basement ventilation not great\nTip: Lunch special prices are 1/2 the price of regular dishes at decent portion sizes!\n-----\n\nFood 5/5\nThis isn't your fake American-Chinese food. The chef here knows how to cook and it shows. Meats are always cooked perfectly with delicious flavors. I like to order the Shredded Beef with Chili and Mapo Tofu dishes. \n\nAtmosphere 2/5\nSituated in a basement the decor is reminiscent of a nightclub rather than a restaurant. A bit dim and poorly ventilated the physical space itself leaves much to be desired.\n\nService 3/5\nHaving gone here several times the service is average at best. Language barriers probably have to do with a lot of it. They are generally attentive but don't expect to be treated like anything but paying customers.\n\nValue 4/5\nLunch special value is definitely a 5/5. It compares to other American Chinese food places in terms of price but much better quality (& authenticity). Regular menu price is high.\n" u"This is my favorite restaurant in town. I go there every week. The owner and all the waiters/waitress are very friendly. They serve both authentic Sichuan cuisine and Americanized Chinese food. They also have hot pot. This is the most popular Chinese restaurant in Ithaca there's always long lines waiting for seats during Fridays and weekends. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good place to eat.\n" u'Ok so I got f15 and it was p good would come again on a February break\n\nLike comment and subscribe for more reviews !!!\n' u'This is an unassuming restaurant that is located in the basement of a building near Cornell university with a number of other restaurants flanking it on all sides. \n\nThe restaurant was super busy due to graduation weekend at Cornell but we were seated promptly. It took a long time for the server to approach our table though. They seemed a bit disorganized. For example they returned to our table 30 mins after our order to tell us that the steamed dumplings weren\'t available. \n\nAlso the restaurant was super hot so we had to move a fan directly onto us. \n\nGiven that we make hot pot at home we decided to order some of the other dishes. Also we wanted to minimize the heat on the table. \n\nNonetheless as per the strengths of the restaurant most of the food we ordered was spicy. \n\nOne was a spicy fish dish----delicious with large peppercorns in them. The fish itself was incredibly fresh. We also got the tripe "dry pot" it was good but I was expecting better. The water spinach was delicious. We had mixed reviews on the beef appetizer. I liked it but some of my family didn\'t. The texture was  a bit like beef belly. We also got general tso chicken and it was okay.\n' u"I was so happy when this place opened up. This restaurant has some of the most authentic chinese food in Ithaca. Plus I love spicy food so now I can get some delicious spicy noodle soup.\n\nThe hot pot isn't bad but it's expensive for how much food you get. You also have to pay extra if you want to get a bowl of sauces for your veggies and meat.\n\nPersonally I love their spicy fish and tofu (\u8c46\u82b1\u9c7c). It's tasty and the portion size is perfect AND it's under $10. Another favorite is their beef noodle soup. You get authentic chinese noodles when you order their noodle soups. They're perfectly chewy and taste homemade. So happy that there is a restaurant in college town where I can get some authentic Chinese dishes.\n" u'Not far from Cornell and Chinese food is great. The only bad thing is that they included 20% tips without asking us!\n' u'Real good Szechuan food. Good service. One complaint s I ordered bok choy without mushrooms yet they charged me mushroom price. Not a good way to treat customers.\n' u"I've been meaning to review this place for a long time - simply put I love it but you can't be high strung about the service or you at least have to go in knowing what to expect.\n\nThe bad: Fairly confusing ordering process and the well-meaning waitstaff (at least when I went) didn't as a group speak very great English (there was one guy who spoke perfect English who seemed to be running around extra to help the others) but it was part of the experience. All is forgotten when the food is served. \n\nThe good: Hot pot is fun! You get to add your own ingredients and sauces and cook it on the table. They serve a variety of delicious Chinese foods that are hard to find in Ithaca the space is cool and roomy and the broths are all good. \n\nBe careful not to add too much of the chili sauce to your pot because you can easily ruin the whole thing. Definitely give this place a try especially if you're with a group not in a rush and looking to have a fun experience not just a meal.\n" u"Decent Sichuan food.\n\nGet the twice cooked pork: it's actually bacon pork and delicious.\n\nThe dumplings in oil have a thick cover which is not the style I like.\n\nOtherwise decent Chinese food!\n" u"Back to the time when I was at college friends usually asked me that what do we eat in China. I'd take them to this restaurant if it was opened by then. Actually even in China we don't usually have that quality of food in restaurants.\n\nThey are super strong at Northeastern dishes and Sichuan dishes. And I believe the chef is much more versatile than their two-sided menu. \n\nI can understand those 1-star reviews that are made about a year ago when the restaurant was just started. I experienced the similar service and didn't feel good about the long waitings wrong dishes etc. But after the first taste of the food I gave up any complaints. I've had dishes from some 'super cooks' in China and I could see big potential of this restaurant. They may need to improve on services and the capability to handle rush hours their Chinese dishes are close to impeccable even better than what you can find in NYC.\n\nHere my review is limited to dishes not including their hotpot. Since I've never had a chance to try the hotpot.\n\nHere I recommend two of my favorite dishes Broiled Sour Cabbage Pork w. Rice      Noodles and Hot Spicy Stew. The first one is authentic Northeastern food very well made with home fermented Bok Choy. The latter one is a variation of the original Sichuan dish (kebab style) but has all the flavors I seek from it. Plus its great value (You'll know if you try to make it by yourself).\n" u"This restaurant is amazing. Food is great and service is great. I am a New Yorker who has been to most of the best Szechuan restaurants in NYC and have found this place the best! The taste of each single dishes were fabulous. My boyfriend who studies at Cornell and I have been here for more than five times in the past week. And we tried more than 10 dishes and hot pot.\n\nI would think that the regular menu tastes a little better than the hot pot menu mainly because of its variety. But don't get me wrong the herbal broth here is the best!!! Expect to wait a little bit though  for the regular menu since they try to save spots for people who want hot pot. And just to solve the confusion about combo price the broth price is NOT INCLUDED. So expect to pay $17 for a combo.\n\nI don't write much reviews because I am lazy. But the quality of the food here made me feel that writing a 5-star review for them is extremely necessary.\n" u"Horrible service! The staff didn't understand much English. Moreover they returned back twice after taking the order to tell us that some of the dishes we ordered were not available. And some of the dishes we ordered finally never came. They did charge us for those initially and we had a hard time explaining this to them.\nI would give 2 on 5 for the food but the overall experience would make my rating less than 1.\n" u'The quality of a Chinese restaurant I hypothesize is highly correlated with the number of English words misspelled on the menu. You\'ll have a hard time holding in your laughter at some of De Tasty\'s amusing word choices and spelling mistakes. I couldn\'t wait to try their "secrete recipes" "doodle soups" and "shredded potato shredded potato." \n\nThey specialize in hot pot and Szechuan cuisine. If you have never had hot pot before it is a simmering pot of flavored broth at the center of the  table. You order ingredients off a menu and place them into the broth to cook and eat. As the meal goes on the broth gets more and more flavorful taking on the flavors of the meats and vegetables you cooked. \n\nSZECHUAN MENU and LUNCH SPECIALS: \nThe Sichuan Lunch Specials are the best lunch specials in collegetown. My favorite dish is the twiced cooked pork. I also really enjoyed their Ma Po Tofu shredded potato and their Fish fillet & tofu w/ roasted chilies. The Kung Pao Chicken is also tasty but this dish is better at "Spicy Asian" on Rt. 13 (side note - De Tasty gives you a much larger serving of rice with your meal than Spicy Asian does - a huge plus in my book). The lunch portion serving sizes are quite large and cheap for $7 - $9. The specials come with a cup of soup that is usually clear broth or egg-drop (nothing special but a nice touch considering it\'s free). The dinner portions are even larger than the lunch portions and a good value. On the appetizer portion of the menu the dan dan noodles are absolutely fantastic. Over all if you are frugal the regular Sichuan menu offers more food for your money than the hot pot menu.\n\nHOT POT:\nThe hot pot is good but in my opinion the regular menu offers a much better value. The spicy broth was great with a very distinct clove and chili pepper flavor. You first order broth for $5 per person (or $9.50 per large pot whichever works out cheaper). Then you can either order individual items to add to the broth or purchase a combo to add a variety of items (noodles several veggies and your choice of meat). My suggestion is to only order one combo to share with all the people in your party and then add other items that match your individual tastes. Buying as many combos as people in your party will be expensive. They have many tasty items to choose from: dumplings shell fish different cuts of meat fish balls 25 different types of vegetables and yes they even have "fish tofu". For those who have never tried "fish tofu" it\'s very tasty but just a hint it isn\'t vegetarian and tastes nothing like tofu. For those who don\'t like sharing a communal soup this place has small personal pots. This way if your dining companion is really into intestine but you\'d prefer not to have intestine flavor getting all up in your shrimp well that doesn\'t have to happen. The spice/sauce bar near the counter can help flavor your soup and is especially important if you ordered the chicken or herbal stock as those are less flavorful than the spicy broth. Hot pot usually works out to be $15 - $20 per person without tax and tip.\n\nCONS: \nProbably the biggest downside is the language barrier and sometimes inattentive service. If you don\'t speak Chinese you might have difficulty communicating with them. In addition the hot pot menu is somewhat confusing which can make the language barrier more frustrating than at other authentic Chinese restaurants. Some of the other reviews say this place is pricey given that you cook your own meal. While the hot pot can be expensive that statement is a bit absurd; it would be like claiming you cook your own microwavable TV dinner. All of the labor is in the prep; just because you place items into the pot doesn\'t mean you are doing most of the work. The "cooking" is part of the fun otherwise why are you at a hot pot restaurant. I\'ve eaten hot pot here 3 times and paid about $13 - 20 per person before tax and tip depending on what we ordered. Note all 3 broths (chicken spicy and herbal) used to have a meat stock base so strict vegetarians were out of luck as far as hot pot goes back in 2014 [[ EDIT: a waiter now told me that the "herbal" broth recipe has been changed to be vegetarian as of 4/20/15 ]] . Several of the entrees on the "vegetables" section of the menu are vegetarian. If this place were in a big city I\'d probably only give it 4 stars but I am so excited that a decent Chinese restaurant has finally come to collegetown. They definitely get an extra star given the lackluster options within walking distance from Cornell.\n' u"Just opened in college town it's still super disorganized and service is very very slow because they only have a few employees. Our meal took 2 hours...\n\nSauces are EXTREMELY lacking and portions are very small for the price unfortunately.\n\nGet the spicy broth (it's not very spicy) over the chicken as it's pretty flavorless to begin with. By the end however it was pretty tasty (after adding a lot of pepper some vinegar and a few spoonfuls of the spicy broth).  Maybe the herbal broth would have been better but we didn't try it.\n\nAlso we didn't try any of the non-hot pot dishes but they looked pretty good!\n" u"This place has the most authentic Chinese food in the area. The hot pot is expensive but the actual dishes are reasonably priced and made really well.\n\nIt looks a little sketchy when you first get there since it's in the basement but the inside is clean and well lit.\n" u"I love coming to this restaurant because of the food and memories I get each time.  It's best to come here with a lot of people so you can order more dishes and share them family style. In particular  I really like their beef dishes and their spicy fish soup.\n" u'Bad services and below ground environment. People in the town usually go because it is almost in the campus and a little more traditional Chinese flavor.\n' u"We had hotpot here. Great food and nice staff! It's worth it to drive all the way here from Corning for some authentic yummy Chinese hotpot!\n" u"I've eaten here twice and each time had the same problem. Someone orders a combo carefully describes what they want to the waiter then receives FULL servings of 9 different items instead of one plate of 9 items. \nThe waiter then feigns helplessness refuses to take any of the extra food back and you wind up paying for 5 times as much food as you wanted. \nA ongoing scam or just a really bad language issue? You decide!\nThat being said the hot pot here is delicious. I really enjoy it. There are lots of vegetarian options including a vegetarian broth (previously unavailable).\nYou can expect to pay about $20 per person unless they mess up your order which is always a possibility.\n" u'An excellent restaurant with a large amount of options. There are many (~20) sauces to choose from and a wide variety of vegetables.\n\nUnfortunately when we went we were confused about how everything worked and there seemed to be a language barrier with the staff when ordering.\n\nAlso the restaurant is pretty expensive for the area. However it is very thorough and you get a very legitimate experience. \n\nBe careful - sometimes the waits are very long for the restaurant.\n']
209.Cajun Cafe Grill,[]
165.Jason‚Äôs Grocery & Deli,[u"Great frozen yogurt-it's healthy there are fat free an low fat options as well as a fully stocked toppings bar. It is help yourself as the total cost is done by weight. It is $7 per pound which sounds expensive...but given the fact that its soft-serve you get a lot. I filled a small bowl for 2.25 complete with a scoop (yes a scoop!) of cookie dough. It actually came to about 3.00 but the guy gave me a break since that was all I had at the time.\n\n\nAlso has solid prices for various groceries a good selection for a small gas station sized market. Go there for the froyo if nothing else.\n" u'Ok. Jason\'s. We get it. The only place open late with overpriced everything. But that is not what has made me disgruntled. Every time I buy something here it is expired! In December 2016 I inspected all 9 remaining Ithaca Hummus containers LITERALLY all of them were expired and some had bacteria growing inside the container. I told the staff. They did not take them out of the fridge rather they said "oh thank you for telling us." Today\'s date is January 17th and I just bought ketchup that expired on DECEMBER 26th! This place is gross. I know a lot of food is safe to eat after expiration but the fact that there is FRESH FOOD THAT IS SOLD EVEN AFTER EXPIRATION IS A HEALTH HAZARD. The hummus had expired HAD BEEN SITTING FOR THREE DAYS AFTER EXPIRATION. I am wondering when the next drunkard buys something and gets a bacterial sickness. Anyways that\'s  all. The staff is usually really nice so I can\'t be too mean. Clearly the management has an incentive to sell expired produce to enlarge profits. Perhaps he is to blame.\n' u"Jason's is a great Collegetown store.  It has what you need in a pinch- from food to medicine.  Jason even accomodated for my dietary needs and got dairy-free froyo.  It makes my day!\n" u'I just had a flash back. Going to Jason\'s the day before St. Paddy\'s Day to buy a 6-pack of Guinness. Completely sober 21 year old. I hand JASON my ID. "I don\'t think so" he says. I\'m confused did I hand him the wrong ID? No its a 100% authentic ID with my picture. \n\n"What\'s wrong with my ID?" I ask. \n"No way are you 21." \n"My birthdate is on the ID. Can\'t you scan it or something?" \n"No you look like you\'re in high school. You can leave now."\n\nFlabbergasted that a business owner could be that rude I leave. Stunned.\n\nThen I walk down the street to Wilson Farms and buy the Guinness with no problem. I walk back to Jason\'s to flip him off and tell him I will never spend money at his store again. Someone else is working the counter and they say he left for the night.\n\nI never got to say F*** YOU to JASON because I never bought anything from his shitty store again. But if you ever read this... F*** YOU!\n' u'Really good froyo! Employees are always really friendly. I recommend the Columbo flavors personally but the other stuff is good too.\n' u"Solid place good beer selection extremely friendly staff and avocados available year round. They serve froyo as well but I've never had it\n"]
124.Synapsis Cafe,[u'One of the best on campus cafes. They serve Finger Lakes Coffee which is much better than the Starbucks served by most campus outlets. Additionally have a wide array of delicious smoothies.\n' u"In terms of campus food this is as good as it gets in my opinion. The one drawback is that it is far. And your food can take quite awhile to be made. But their flatbreads/ pizzas are amazing. They're super thin and crispy and a great lunch. The other thing I typically get is the tomato grilled cheese which is delicious and filled with melted cheese deliciousness! Only come here if you're near or you have time though as it can take awhile and is rather far from everywhere else.\n" u'Synapsis is one of the better places to eat on Cornell Campus. They have a ton of Vegan options for those who can\'t eat dairy but still want "cheese" and a very popular smoothie/bubble tea bar. Their salads are tasty but not filling enough for my appetite (I prefer Ivy Room or Trillium for this). My favorite item on the menu is their healthier rendition of the spanakopita (Greek cheese and spinach pie). Unlike most places this one isn\'t greasy (some may find the exterior dry but I prefer it this way). It\'s the perfect snack. The breakfast wraps are also very good.\n' u"An actually decent place to eat at Cornell. And i'm not alone in saying that. The other two reviewers say the same thing yet they give it a 3...? Whatever Their pizzas are flat bread style and my favorite is the Genoa.\n" u'As far as campus food goes Synapsis offers the best lunch fare for a decent price. They offer a variety of flatbread "pizzas" (which can be hit or miss depending on how long it was baked) grilled cheese sandwiches and deli sandwiches. I prefer getting the turkey grilled cheese with a soup (~$10) though sometimes I got an order of potato wedges instead of the soup. They also sell fruit smoothies and coffee drinks but I never ordered those since they\'re a bit pricey. Best of all if you come often enough the staff will remember your name and your order!\n' u'A solid choice for campus dining. They are regularly introducing new menu items (or whole menu sections) to keep things fresh. The joe is good (hot and always fresh) and the sammiches are tasty.\n']
52.Luna,[u"This place is great for those who eat animals and for those who don't. I like the creative things they do here! The chefs have carefully crafted some really tasty foods like the sweet potato kale tacos. Boom! So good! There is a vegetarian menu with even vegan options. \nWhen i had a problem with my order management fixed the situation and made sure I was happy with the place.\nHappy hour 4-6  1/2 price tacos? You can't beat that! Such specials have me not just coming in during those times but appreciating the place in the evening (even late late night too).\n" u"Garbage never tasted so good.\n\nAs a huge fanatic of fried chicken coming from the south it's one thing that's very hard to find done right. Up until visiting Wings over held the best wings (in my limited food experience here) imo but after the legal issues they're having I can't get it anymore.\n\nThe garbage sauce is some crazy concoction of all of their seasonings which combined and it hits something that's amazingly good like a thousand island dressing but with more zip. Definitely something uniquely Ithaca as far as I can tell and needless to say I will be back.\n\nIf price is an issue (it seemed pretty average/reasonable to me) go during lunch. I was literally the only customer eating there. I think wings + fries were $11. Can't comment about the other menu items but they should really consider using the garbage sauce on more of their menu options. \n\nIf you do get wings I'd recommend putting the sauce on the side since it can get a bit overwhelming and the last few bites aren't as crunchy.\n" u"Spending my Friday night studying and I missed dining hall hours so I decided to order the Taco Salad and Smoked Gouda Mac n' Cheese from here. I was worried that the flavor profile would be different than what I am used to however I was pleasantly surprised! The delivery driver was very friendly and the food was very fresh and tasty. The portion sizes were also very big! Absolutely no complaints! Best food I've had in Ithaca!\n" u'Quite possibly the slowest restaurant I have ever been too. I genuinely could have walked to the closet grocery store bought everything needed to make my meal walked back cooked it and ate it in the time it took me to get my food. It is mind boggling how a restaurants service can be this slow. I will never look at this place again let alone eat here. \nPs. The food is okay.\n' u'I used to order from Luna\'s regularly their food is very good. I ordered from them about a month ago and ended up canceling my order within minutes due to them being unable to deliver because of the weather. I realized about a week later that I never received a refund. I called them 4 times total over the course of a month leaving my information each time and each time being assured that my refund was on its way. I called today and immediately asked to speak to the owner i was told by the man I spoke to that he has gotten notes from his employees several times with my information but "notes are meaningless to me". He explained that he had just processed my refund earlier today and it was a huge coincidence that I happened to call. A few minutes later I got an email conformation saying that my refund has just been submitted. So if those notes are meaningless how did you already refund me before I called? Not only did he ignore my messages but he lied to me about having already refunding my money. Now I will have to wait up to 10 days for my refund to process. \nFood quality isn\'t everything Luna work on your customer service.\n' u'Great food! I am very impressed as a vegetarian with the food options including buffalo tofu wings with ranch dressing (so good!)  The fried cookie dessert was awesome too!  Not too expensive either :)\n' u'This is a pretty awesome experience. Located in college town in the back of Lot 10 is a "food window" serving a variety of street inspired foods from across the world - a most excellent menu! A little on the pricey side but the quality is \n\nSmoked Gouda Mac: to die for. I am extremely choosy about my mac n\' cheese and this one exceeded my expectations!\n\nTaco Salad: rather awesome with a nice kick! Greens cilantro lime rice blacks beans smokey salsa cotja cheese and more!\n\nChicken Shawarma Bowl: moist tasty grilled chicken cucumbers tomatoes onions atop greens and triangles of naan bread and a very tasty tzatziki sauce and lemon oil. \n\nThere was ONE guy taking orders AND cooking - he did an awesome job!\nWould come here again and again. Amazing food reasonably priced.\n' u"As so many reviews here have indicated the prices here are very high for such small portions. The demographic may be targeted at wealthy Cornell students who can afford eating at these prices.\n\nHaving said that I've tried nearly everything on the menu. The tacos are small but delicious. I like the salads a lot. The pizza is adequate but nothing special in my opinion. The Only Burger is delicious but very small. The Mac & Cheese is very good and I especially enjoyed BBQ Shortrib Mac Sandwich. I didn't really care for the standard fries but the duck fat fries are better. I found the poutine disappointing. My daughter loves the fried oreos. \n\nI think the wings are some of the best I've had in town. I especially like the garbage sauce.\n\nOverall the menu is extensive and very creative and it changes often. They seem to use high quality ingredients but I believe there may be an issue at times with quality control as sometimes items are hit or miss.\n\nThey have a phone app which is not only convenient it will save you some time ordering if there is a long line.\n\nGenerally the staff is very friendly and the service is good. It may take a while to get your food however. We always called (or apped) in our order ahead of time to save on the wait. However they often missed the special instructions we'd include with our orders.\n" u'I am a vegetarian and I learned about Luna through the Vegan Meetup group. Their sweet potato tacos are my favorite and their taco salad is pretty fantastic as well! The atmosphere is not good so I always take my food to go!\n' u"I love this place having eaten dinner here numerous times. My favorites have been the shortrib chili with great dried chili flavor and nice tender meat and the chicken wings crispy with lots of great flavor options. My daughter loves the incredibly rich smoked mac & cheese. We've also had decent salad fun asian buns and solid vegan tacos. I don't think you can go wrong here especially considering local and vegan options. Delicious fun well-priced.\n" u"I had one bad experience here when my food got soggy after sitting for a while when no one called me up but they offered me replacement and I've loved it ever since. The Korean beef tacos and poutine are my favorite. So flavorful and delicious!!!\n" u'Horrible delivery service. 1.5hr wait no ranch sauce for wings no silverware and napkins although it was requested.\n' u"I wanted to like this place so badly. The ambience decor music all fit with the food truck aspect they are aiming for very well. The guys working there were all really nice and helpful. The menu looked great and it was hard to pick what to order which is always good. We tried the smoked Gouda Mac n cheese Gouda fries Baja fish tacos bang bang tacos and garlic knots. The presentation was great and all the food looked awesome when it came out. However so close yet so far. The Baja fish tacos were freezing cold so I'm assuming that must have been intentional. I've never had cold fish tacos before--which I guess I still haven't because I kid you not it was all slaw and no fish. I'm not someone who demands big portions either it was just odd. Mac n cheese was bland fries were decent garlic knots below average however the bang bang tacos were good. Two mini tacos for $7.49 is bizarre though. The portions for a half order of fries and a half order of Mac n cheese were really really big a generous size for the price. Again I wanted to like this place so bad definitely a lot of potential it just didn't come together for me.\n" u'I have ordered from here twice both times it took over 1.5 hours get have my food delivered. I\'ve called them to ask for clarification of where my food was and they couldn\'t even tell me if my food had been made was out for delivery or was still being cooked! Additionally the delivery driver was incompetent and rude calling and saying "I can\'t find it" but not giving any indication of where they were or what was around them. Additionally the food is pretty mediocre and quite overpriced for the portion size.\n' u'The lot 10 location is my new favorite late night french fry spot everything else i have had there is great.\n' u'They delivered to our hotel pretty quick too. Duck bacon wontons were incredible. All three tacos were good but I wanted at least 12 more Korean BBQ tacos. \n\nOverall the flavors are complex and balance each other well. Well done sir well done.\n' u'This is a pretty average place. Small portions at high prices. I went here closer to when they opened and the same issues existed. But gave them a break as they were new. Returned recently and its still not good enough. \n\nThey claim that the prices are high as they use "local organic  ingredients". No offense but that is a bunch of bull if they cannot put out a quality product. I\'m glad the food is organic but a 3-bite taco for $6 is just dumb. And the meat is salty and chewy. $4 for a slice of pizza....and the toppings are scarce. Their pork belly bao bun is really good but you need to search for the pork belly in the bun. And you need 4 to fill up at $5 each. Its kinda sad as the taste is solid.\n\nBottom line - You can easily spend $15 and walk out looking to buy a snack somewhere else. Their high prices are not due to "high" quality. They are due to the fact that they need some basic f&b training.\n' u'Tasty but super expensive for the amount of food. $3.50 for a bottle of iced tea? $10 for a sandwich? Not truck or street food prices. Overpriced by any standard.\n' u'Was very excited after reading other reviews... While the ambience was neat the menu written on the wall was overwhelming. Looking over that fact the menu sounded interesting and eccentric. We ordered "only burgers" and the "duck fat fries" after waiting for a longer amount of time than we should have being the only people in the place I\'d have to say we were less than impressed. We received slider sized burgers that were the price of regular burgers at any other restaurant the toppings just didn\'t mix. As for the duck fat fries the taste of the fries were mediocre the texture being on the soggy side. The redeeming feature of the meal however was the chipotle dipping sauce that came with the fries. Mediocre not sure I\'d go for another try.\n*alexis\n' u"VEGETARIANS/VEGANS BEWARE THE TOFU WINGS\n\nI was taken aback by the fact that all of the sauces have animal product in them. I am vegan and was asking for clarification regarding the ingredients in the sauces. They told me that even if the sauces did not have dairy in them they were not vegan because they use a pork(?) or chicken (?) glaze as a base. I told them that they should probably mark that especially for the tofu wings which they mark as the vegetarian wing option WITHOUT HAVING A VEGETARIAN SAUCE OPTION. when i brought it up it almost felt like they were getting defensive. this I found to be the oddest part. Its okay if the sauces all have meat in them but people just want to know so they can make the choice not to eat it. If you don't mark your sauces as having a meat base especially when using them to provide a vegetarian option (??) its going to bother people.\n"]
48.Taverna Banfi,[u"Service - 5\nI'm not sure if the servers are all Hotel School students but they do a great job. Very professional in handling stuff they mind their business and they are friendly. Food can take awhile to get there depending on the size of your party. This is probably a function of their kitchen more than servants. \n\nFood - 5\nI ate several times here and their appetizers and antipasti are awesome. Lots of different menu including a buffet. For the most part food is very good. \n\nAtmosphere - 5\nThey have a variety of spaces from private rooms to small tables to cozy window single tables. I love the feel.\n\nPrice/Value - 3\nI've never paid out of my own pocket while here. I can imagine it is somewhat overpriced given limited amount of competition and plenty of customers with deep pockets. However the quality is definitely high so even if a bit overpriced at least you are getting a good experience.\n" u'Had the homemade pappardelle with sausage and peas and it was delicious. My teen kids both had the chicken scaloppine and loved it. Glass of the Riesling was perfect. Overall a very pleasant evening.\n' u"Meh this place was ok but WAY over priced for what you are getting. The service was super slow too for being one of maybe 4 or 5 parties in the whole restaurant. Got the salmon dish which was pretty good. The truffle sauce really made it better. I DONT recommend the Brussels sprouts. I love good roasted brussel sprouts and will try them wherever I go but there's were soggy and bland. Tiramisu was pretty good though! Very soft and spongy with a good coffee flavor.\n" u'Sunday brunch... overall a great selection of food and everything was prepared well and tasted great. Service was hovering for beverages or anything we may have needed. Nice to see specific diet ingredients called out on certain foods -- like contains eggs vegan etc.\n\nSeating was roomy and the only real downside as others have noted is the pricing. As good as it is it just feels expensive for the overall location and value.\n' u'Had a great dinner with friends here-food is good but somewhat pricey. Our server was very attentive and polite.\n\nI had the scallops with angel hair pasta in caper butter. Delicious and richly indulgent. Dessert was a very good chocolate tort.\n' u"We came for a graduation dinner. The location was a little confusing. It's located in a building that looks more like apartments and there isn't clear signage. The food was delicious but we had someone in our party who was allergic to almonds and rosemary. Unfortunately almost everything had either almonds or Rosemary on it. It's especially bad because we had called ahead and pre-arranged a prix fixe menu so they knew about our allergies. We had a tense dinner because the mama bear in our party was not happy about our menu. The manager gave us half off the bill which was appreciated. I would have given them more stars because the staff was friendly and the food was good. Unfortunately allergies can be life threatening and are very serious.\n" u"As a parent of two Cornellians I have been coming to Banfi for years. The experience has been consistently good. The service and the food are great. And I like the list of finger lakes wines by the glass.  My favorite entree is the short ribs which are unparalleled. \n\nI love to see the students working every aspect of this restaurant. And it is interesting to see the diversity from Hotelies to engineers. And they are all committed to delivering a quality experience. I have several stories to support this but they are too long to mention. Suffice it to say that you will be well fed and well taken care of. I can't wait to go back!\n" u'At $45.00 per adult and $22.00 for kids with breakfast and lunch buffets in two different rooms the set up was all over the place and a bit cumbersome. The food was fine and plentiful and the service was adequate. However when it is pretty much self service and pretty pricey\n except for clean up and beverages suggesting tips is pretty tacky. I was put off.\n' u'Brunch is the best in town. Fresh food well prepared professional service.\nPlease check out their menu before make a reservation because they rotated menu  every weeks (they have 4 menu). I am also like their smoked salmon too and also salad.\n' u"Taverna Banfi is A-OK. We entered on a Saturday morning after spending the night in the Statler Hotel. We just missed the breakfast buffet and honestly breakfast but were told we could order off the regular menu. The host was not terribly hospitable really but perhaps our arriving as the buffet was being broken down was frazzling her. No matter we got a terrific seat and were treated like royalty by the servers tending to our needs. The servers each would receive five stars if they could be rated separately from the restaurant: they were working hard courteous enthusiastic and clearly A students.\n\nWe ordered buttermilk pancakes with blueberries which came (slightly overdone and too brown hence dried out) beautifully displayed with plenty of hot and juicy blueberries and a lovely arrangement of fresh fruit pieces and Cornell maple syrup; and a garden frittata nicely done with garden goodness basil and mozzarella cheese mixed together for a delicious combination. The potato of the day though sorry to say gets two thumbs down. They appeared to be shoestring potatoes but alas they may well have been actual shoestrings. Beyond crispy not good. Could be the slim pickins this late in the morning (11 o'clock-ish). Tea was very good I add this because often tea drinkers do not get proper service. The tea came with a darling little individual bottle of honey very nice. Coffee was just what you might expect at an upscale restaurant.\n\nNow the music: the blasting hideous piped-in music was awful to have to listen to. Really wrecked the atmosphere and beauty of a couple on a weekend get-away. Understandably it was supposed to be in keeping with the Italian theme but it did not make the cut. Something more subtle - and quieter - would have been a better choice. Perhaps it was more suitable for happy hour?\n\nIn conclusion while in Ithaca I would suggest a different restaurant than the Statler Hotel's for breakfast. You can surely find breakfast for less than $40+ for two. The money you'll save can go towards a nice dinner somewhere else.\n" u'If you come here for the breakfast buffet you will really enjoy your meal. If you come here any other time you will pay a lot of money for mediocre food.\n\nBreakfast Buffet: For around $13 you can get the "on the lighter side" buffet. Now this is actually a pretty good deal because smoked salmon is in the "on the lighter side" section. Now the salmon is served in small portions on individual plates so you might feel self conscious if you take say 6 plates of salmon but I am not a self conscious person when it comes to enjoying myself at a buffet. Of course you should probably eat something besides smoked salmon (or not ... I won\'t judge) and yogurt pastries fruit and various other "cold" items are also included in this less expensive option. If you fork over $20 you can add eggs bacon all sorts of sausages potatoes blinis and other hot items which are all quite good.\n\nDinner: The gnochi is greasy and the sauce lacks the right balance of salt acid and sweetness. The actual gnochi itself is heavy and not the right texture. I have ordered a fish dish here that was over cooked and bland as well. I really have never been satisfied consuming any dish a la carte from this restaurant.\n' u"Ate here for a group meal where I didn't pay so take this review that way. I had chicken scallopini over mashed potatoes that was delicious along with some good red wine. It seems like a typical nice hotel restaurant. Good food nice atmosphere but likely pretty pricey.\n" u'Best focaccia on earth! My friends and I worked here as students at the Hotel School so we had a chance to try everything on the menu. Great for brunch and dinner!\n' u"BREAKFAST.  The breakfast buffet here is phenomenal.\n\nHigh-quality and locally-sourced ingredients.  Savory bacon...baaaacon.  The sausage is special and the eggs are fairly good.  Particularly impressive is the smoked salmon.  I always go for smoked salmon when I'm anywhere in the great State of New York it never disappoints.  A good selection of fruit and plain yogurt to accompany it.\n\nAt around $20 (less if you stick to cold items) this is one of the best breakfasts I've had anywhere.  The fact that I get to enjoy it every single day I stay in Ithaca?  Priceless.  I went out on a later flight home just to enjoy one last meal in the city that is just plain gorges.\n\nI'll admit I haven't been here for lunch or dinner in a long time so the review doesn't factor that into account but given my success breaking my fast in the morning I would expect them to be superlative at satiating someone any time of the day.\n" u'This restaurant was so accommodating. We came here three times on our vacation not only because it was convenient but also because they were so good. The food was delicious the servers were on their game and kind etc. They accommodated my gluten-free friends so well. All the food is great and I recommend the buffet if you eat breakfast there.\n' u"As a student I was really excited to get the chance to eat here for free when an employer hosted a dinner.  The service was absolutely fantastic but the food did not live up to my expectations.  The fried calamari had too think of a coating on it and it's sauce was not as flavorsome and spicy as the menu made it seem like it would be.  What disappointed me the most was the beef short rib.  I barely ate it!  I've had many short ribs at this price point and this one was by far the worst.  It was literally sitting a pool of its own fat.  It was soft but its flavor could not come out because of how it dripped in fat.  If I was not with an employer I would have sent it back.\n" u'Delicious weekend brunch stocked with everything from pancakes to mini yogurt parfaits. My only reservation is Banfi is overpriced for the quality capitalizing on visitors. Still it is one of the best restaurants in Ithaca and has very fresh and delicious fish dishes to indulge in for a classy dinner.\n' u"Good food and good service but high prices. If the cost was lower I'd give it 4 stars for taste and creativity. I appreciated that the server knew which entree was vegan and which dishes could be made vegan upon request. I had a crespelle - basically a black bean crepe with quinoa and bean filling and some pesto and pea shoots. Good but not amazing.\n" u"First off the only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the price.\n\nThe food here is amazing seriously amazing and the lunch buffet is awesome! I love eating here but for someone who is always on a budget this is not a place I usually go if paying for a group. It was $18 for the lunch buffet. I've been to Florida resorts and paid less than that for just as good buffets if not better. So that was a surprise but if you've got the money I'd definitely hit this up as it is one of the best places to eat on campus!\n" u'Excellent NY Strip steak and even better dessert menu\n']
26.Ithaca Beer Company,[u'Recommendations: Green Trail IPA Cocoa Ono stout Winter Smoke porter Flower Power IPA.  \n\nIthaca beer company is located a quick drive away from downtown five or so minutes from the Commons or either of the colleges.  They\'re set back from civilization basically in the woods-- yet frankly only a tiny leap away from the city.  \n\nThe Cocoa Ono stout which I believe is only a limited-time Winter 2017 variety is dark full-bodied caramely robust and unapologetically bold. It has orange peel added that gives it a certain kind of zest and if you\'re into darker stouts this is one to definitely try.  Malty with a taste like coffee.  There\'s a subtle sweetness as well.  My one complaint with the beer is that it does taste a bit syrupy but this is common with the terrain.  \n\nThe Green Trail is a lighter easy-drinking IPA that\'s nowhere near as bold as some of its hoppier IPA cousins.  It\'s smooth simple intelligible.  If there\'s anything negative to mention it\'s a bit timid compared to other beers I\'ve tasted here.  \n\nThe Winter Smoke porter was merely okay.  I mightttt try it again to get a better profile? It\'s also temporary for the current season so it won\'t be around much longer.  It\'s made with juniper berries.  The bartender told me it\'s reminiscent of caramel and "baked bread" but I wasn\'t tasting it.  \n\nInside it\'s simply gorgeous: an "L" shaped bar with a variety of beers on tap lots of tables a beautiful patio outside where they have cornhole in the summer and plenty of standing room and sidetables to sit down at.  It feels like a Wegmans outpost.  Lots of natural light wood in the interior.  Everything feels real sturdy and not... plastic.  \n\nIt was busy when I came through on a Friday night with lots of chatter and conversation and a light buzz of energy circulating through the open high-ceilinged room. As the night went on it got sort of loud but definitely not in a way that interrupted our night. \n\nService was kind friendly informative and warm. I didn\'t talk much to my bartender but I did notice him talking to others so there\'s that. \n\nI had a great time here.  I\'ll come back especially in the summer.  A GREAT Ithaca place that has a truly unique and local feel.\n' u"Really great brewery. 50% of the beers we tried were delicious. The other half were not our personal preference. Overall a great experience with wonderful staff and a great environment.\nA member of our group had a problem with their order (too spicy) and tour server went above and beyond to remedy the situation. \nWe got here late Sunday afternoon and there was a 15 minute wait which was fine because you can have drinks at the bar while you wait. In warmer months there's a great outdoor seating area.\nMy husband enjoyed the burger so much that he had to order a second one because of how delicious it was. \nMany local and organic items featured on the menu which I really appreciate.\nThis is a great place to stop if your heading to or from the finger lakes region.\n" u"Flower Power the name of one of my favorite beer and this company makes it. So I decided I'll swing by at the brewery and have fun up there. Near 5 hours drive I arrived to the city of Ithaca. If you never been there I tell you this is an old Greek town as you can see it from its name. The city has a good vibe probably because of the colleges a  very cool farmers market by the river of Linderman Creek and one of the best Brewery in the state.\nSo I visited the brewery and I found out it has a restaurant with a little garden. I tried different kind of beers and food and just loved it. I had awesome I mean awesome pizza so every day till I was in this town I ate and drink here. \nYou should try if you haven't yet. Its a nice trip up there the Finger lakes area is gorgeous and worth the trip\n" u"Stopped here for dinner after a day of exploring Ithaca. It was packed on a Saturday night around 6:30pm. There was a 30min wait for a table so we got a flight of beer from the bar and found a seat outside while we waited for a table. \n\nThe atmosphere is awesome both inside and out. There's a full bar inside with 10+ Ithaca beers on tap. High top tables on one side and regular tables on the other. Outside there's a fire pit with chairs tons of seating with umbrellas picnic tables and a tent you can purchase chips and salsa all overlooking a beautiful field. It's also very family friendly. There were a few little league teams having dinner and kids playing in the field while we were here. \n\nI ordered the white pizza. Garlic herb oil fontina cheese wood oven roasted broccoli & banana peppers. The pizza dough is made with NY organic flour and cooked in their wood-fired oven. It's a small pizza but can easily be shared by two people. It was delicious. You can not go wrong ordering the pizza! My friend got a burger and said she was a little disappointed. I mentioned to the waitress it was my friends birthday and she came out with a bowl of icecream with a candle. It was a nice touch! This is a must if you're around the Ithaca area and have some time to kill. We will be back!\n" u"Ithaca Beer Company is what a craft brewery could and should be. I had high hopes after drinking their beers for years now when I visited the beer company during Ithaca's graduation weekend and wow was I blown away. The place was packed at 12:30 1 o'clock when the place only opens at 12! That's how you know your in the right spot. \n\nWe had 6 in our party but only 4 of us arrived early so we put our names down for a table of 6 outside and got some beers at the bar. We each started with a pint and headed out side to play some corn hole. What a great idea to have tailgating games in this picturesque backyard where you can see they growing hops and the mountains behind. \n\nThe beer is priced how a brewery should price! Pints range from I believe about $5-$9 depending on alcohol content and availability. Where else can you get their famous Flower Power for $7-8 bucks. Flights are priced under $10. Yea its that good. \n\nAfter a a few games of corn hole we received the text from the beer company our table was ready about 45 minutes after we arrived. We were seated with some more beer and looked over their amazing menu. Before I get into that a big shout out to the amazing staff here. The bar staff the bus boys the waiters and waitresses all top notch attentive and friendly. \n\nSo to the food. We started with the fries flight a must for the table served with three homemade sauces and their daily special bar pie with 6 slices. A perfect start for a party of 6. The special pie had bacon and asparagus on it. It was so good I can't even explain especially since the beer was starting to sit in. We all ordered our own and shared a bit. I tried some of the white pizza again amazing. I personally ordered the cheddar burger with a side salad. The side salad was dressed perfectly and had fresh beets which was a nice touch. A great combo to go along with a cheddar burger cooked perfectly with bacon. This was a dish you get at a specialty burger bar not a brewery. \n\nFrom the environment and staff to the beer and food Ithaca is one of my favorite breweries I have ever visited ( I have been to at least 50 at this point) and I didn't even get a chance to tour. Next time I might end up spending an entire day here it was that great. Make sure you visit this destination completely worth every penny!\n" u"If I could give this place 10 stars I would!! We were here for graduation weekend with my boyfriend and his family so we stopped in for lunch. They don't take reservations and for a party of 6 it was about a 30-45 minute wait. It sounds like a longish time but it goes by quick when you have corn hole to play and beer to drink!\n\nThey have a fantastic lawn area in the back as well as a large patio. They have fire pits for when it gets cold and for the nights and Adirondack chairs to hang out in while you wait for a table or if you just want to take in the scenery while drinking a cold one.\n\nWhen we sat at our table our waitress Randy was quick to come over to us and get our orders. For the appetizers we got the special pizza which has bacon and asparagus on it and the fry flight which is a must. The pizza was delicious with the thin crust charred lightly just the way I like it and the dipping sauces for the fries were yummy as well. For dinner I ordered the white pizza which was amazing as well. My boyfriend ordered a burger which was cooked to order and tasty too. Overall the food was great and the whole local ingredients thing is a nice touch. And of course to wash all the food down I got the flagship flight of beers. \n\nThis place is amazing and I wish I had more places by me like this. It seems like a good environment where people weren't drinking to get trashed but to have a good time. But it may have been different since like I said it was graduation weekend and a lot of families were occupying the area. The food is good and the prices are very reasonable which goes a long way for a college students budget. If I'm ever in the area again I plan to return which I hope is soon!\n" u"A great brewery in the outskirts of Ithaca. The staff and ambiance was amazing shuffleboard and beer while you wait for a table great music playing on the speakers... and great local hand made food!!! And I didn't even mention the beer yet!!! They have over ten beers on tap at one time including root beer and cider ! Make the trip and give this place a t\n" u'This is a well-known NYS brewery. I expected it to be phenomenal but it didn\'t really wow me. It was pretty busy on Saturday and there was a 20-25 minute wait for the patio (which is totally worth the wait). We could have sat inside right away but preferred to enjoy the nice spring weather. They have corn-hole boards a fire pit picnic tables and a view of a big field. I can see where living in the Ithaca area this would seem like an oasis. However it\'s pretty standard for a brewery in the more rural areas. Very family friendly.\n\nThe inside area has a big bar and some bar top tables along with the indoor dining space. When we arrived the bar was packed. I\'m giving them the benefit of the doubt that they are more engaging with customers if the place isn\'t as busy. Not one of the bartenders said anything more than "what can I get you". Since it\'s a brewery (I\'ve been to my fair share) I expect more of a informational approach. Maybe make some suggestions? Maybe go over your offerings? Is that old fashioned now?\n\nThey do have a nice variety. I (accidentally) tried their root-beer and it was good. To be honest I thought it was alcoholic root-beer like Not Your Father\'s. So maybe I\'m just writing this review completely based on my embarrassment of ordering the drink that all the children in the place were sipping on. I really didn\'t realize it was non-alcoholic it was listed above the bar along with all the other beer. So I\'ll once again point fingers toward the bartenders and staff for not clarifying or educating. Once I downed that delicious soda I did try a flight of their beer. It was good. \n\nThe food was just okay. My party of 4 shared the cheese plate and each ordered our own meal. Cheese plate was super small for the price. I also had a burger and fries. Pretty average. Didn\'t care for the fries and the burger was small for the price. To put it in perspective one person in my group had grilled cheese and soup and it cost $12.\n\nI wouldn\'t argue about returning someday but I won\'t drive out of my way to get here. Also I would definitely eat somewhere else in town. Side note: I refuse to believe I\'m the only person that has made the root-beer mistake!! Any other idiots out there??\n' u"Really good beer and delicious pub food.\n\nIBC offers several ways to enjoy their fine brews.  Get a flight and try as many as you can.  I particularly recommend the Hellish Lager for as long as they offer it.  This is a superb helles a wonderful warm-weather beer.  When you find a variety that you like you can order most in 8- or 16-ounce servings for $3 and $5 respectively.  Where I come from there is no such thing as a five-dollar pint anymore not for quality craft beer.  And if you're not much of an imbiber or need to drive afterwards the half-pint size is perfect.  You don't see those very often in the U.S.\n\nExcellent value for a quality product!\n\nThe pulled pork sandwich and french fries are outstanding.  If you prefer they will substitute a nice little salad with a couple of slices of red beet on top.  But let me reiterate that the fries are excellent particularly with the house ketchup.\n\nTop notch service too.  This place gets busy at dinner time but it's worth a wait or an off-peak visit.\n" u"Good beer tasty burgers great location. \n\nI was starving when I came here and I left happy. My burger was well cooked and very very satisfying. I also really enjoyed the fries. Their farm to table sustainable food philosophy is appreciated. Their property has a nice and spacious outdoors space where they were setting up for some kind of show. Beer truck included. \n\nIf I lived in the area I'd definitely be a regular.\n" u"I wish I could go back and eat my entire meal again! Got the flagship flight and I enjoyed it-nice variety of different types of beer. But the star of the show was the Italian roast pork sandwich-lost my mind. I've had similar sandwiches at Italian markets and delis but nothing came close to this sandwich. Also got their apple pie special for dessert-delicious! My friend also got the apple pork sandwich-quite tasty! Overall delicious and will be stopping back whenever I am in the area!\n" u"They make a good dark brew. It's hard to pick up on the chocolate nodes they describe but it's still a good beer. The cider is a bit strong but also good.\n" u'Outdoor seating is the best on a sunny day with a cool breeze. They have umbrellas and heavy tables (tried to move one andbit was very stable.  Staff is fast friendly and knowledgeable.   Had a burger made to order and it was juicy and made with lean meat.  It came with lots of fresh cut french fries which were prefectly seasoned.  I had a nice fresh root beer on tap.  Hope to return to try some of their other burgers.\n' u"I really love how family friendly this brew pub is. This was our second visit. We were one of many family's dining on a Friday night around happy hour. It's a large enough place with plenty of outside space that everyone can find a good spot to drink their face off eat a meal with their family play bocce read a book and drink wine sit by a fire pit stand and stare in anticipation at the pallet wood Bon fire area. You see there was a lot going on but something for everyone. The pizza is amazing the French fry flight is fun and the beers are WOOOHOOOO. I had the poster child and the underdog. Husband had a bent nose because he was the DD. Awesome. My kids had locally sourced hotdogs pizza and cider and ran like hellions with a pack of other children in the field and around the trees. It was really a nice stop.\n" u"Great spot. I always enjoy coming here with friends. Having the cornhole outside and ADK chairs makes it really fun. The beer is some of the best I've had. I always enjoy every one I try. Even brought my friends here for a bachelor party. Definitely recommend!\n" u"What a cool spot! This was our first time here since they moved from that small little shop on the side of the road.  We went on a cool fall day so outside seating wasn't really an option but we got a table inside for lunch.  The food menu wasn't anything expansive but for a brewery it was perfect beer soup grilled cheese burger and fries- couldn't ask for anything more.  We ordered 2 flights of beer to try as much variety as we could.  We had some favorites and not- so favorites (but hey its all personal preference).  \n\nFrom there we went on the brewery tour.  Our guide was amazing! She was fun knowledgeable and vibrant. It was cool to hear how Ithaca makes beer learn about their history and some new features coming soon.\n\nAfter that we bellied up to the bar had another round and bought some swag.  I'm not much of a beer drinker but I did enjoy their pumpkin beer while my fiance's favorite is their flower power. \n\nOverall experience was great for a Saturday afternoon nice atmosphere mostly friendly staff (hostess seemed like she hated people lol not really the right profession for that) good food and brews!\n" u"Just a tad beyond the business retail strip Ithaca Beer Company is a nice option for a brewpub drink or meal.  A variety of beer flights and many food choices with locally sourced ingredients.  We enjoyed the soup salad special and 2 different pizzas.  The menu is certainly upscale from standard bar food.  Service is good.  While it wasn't warm enough to sit outside it looks like Ithaca Beer has a great outdoor patio.\n\nIt's a bit hard to find.  Once you exit from Elmira Road you need to drive down the hill and around the back of the building immediately in front of you.\n" u"A hot summer day a flight to Ithaca with towering cumulus clouds all around; the Ithaca Farmers Market Ithaca Beer Co and flying back to Buffalo. That was my Sunday and it was pretty glorious.\n\nIthaca Beer Co. is a little outside of the small downtown area but the area is huge. It feels like you're parking on a farm somewhere but you walk into a huge building with a large restaurant room/bar outside patio and the closed off production facility. We asked to be seated outside and there was about a 15 minute wait. They had those vibrating buzzers ready in hand and the wait was welcome while my friend enjoyed a beer and we played some shuffleboard.\n\nYes they have shuffleboard! Bars/breweries with shuffleboard definitely get an extra star in my book (and as I wrote this I just increased Ithaca Beer Co from 4 to 5 because come on -- it's amazing!). When we were finally seated outside I ordered a soup and a burger. The soup was a summer chilled beet/yogurt mix and it was the most delicious chilled soup I've had all season. My only regret was ordering a cup instead of a bowl. It was so glorious.\n\nThe burger came fairly soon after. It looked small but elegant and crafty. Probably 6-8oz. The roll was delicious and locally baked a few blocks away with some farm fresh meat cooked medium rare to perfection. It was a really satisfying burger with lots of flavor and not so huge as to totally knock you off your wits (after all we had to fly back to Buffalo!). The fries were crispy and right and even the ketchup was housemade (it was a lot sweeter and tangier and seemed like it was made with some fresh tomatoes although I didn't confirm).\n\nOverall the service was amazing. The food was glorious and SHUFFLEBOARD. How do you not give 5-stars?\n" u'Love this brewery for so many reasons! Great place to bring the family or venture out solo. Wonderful food with a seasonally rotating menu and lots of local fare! Rotating selection of small batch beers intersperse the classics-- Green Trail Flower Power Super Stout... Not to mention the amazing outdoor space!\n' u"Found this place while looking for a farm to table option for burgers etc. A little outside of town this was perfect after a long day at a Cornell class and touring around town in the August heat. The AC wasn't working and it was clearly tough on staff but our bartender was extremely patient and good natured. He was obviously passionate about locally sourced foods and the good beer being produced there. \n\nClassic cheddar burger was awesome. Get a side of garlic or chipotle aioli and pair with a refreshing Hopkist session IPA you won't be disappointed. Would definitely go back! \n\nIn case anyone is wondering they claim the meat is sourced locally on the website listing Autumn's Harvest farm (Animal Welfare Approved- http://www.autumnsharvestfarm.com/beef.htm) but not sure if this rotates. Either way they expressed a strong commitment to this kind of sourcing. Enjoy!\n"]
203.Blimpie,[u'it is a sandwich shop in a Hess station.\n\nGiven that it was 3 in the morning I just got out of a work emergency and had no excuse otherwise to pick up a sub at a Hess station but I did anyway ... and I am ashamed ... but on the up side it was not as bad as it could have been!\n\nAll in all it was not horrible. The veggies where okay the meat was ... probobly oscar meyer ...\n\nbut it cost me like 3 bucks so that is my excuse. \n\nI did not expect much and I was not dissapointed.\n']
107.Sahara Mediterranean Restaurant,[u"So the only negative thing I think one could say about this place is that it is not cheap.  However no place downtown is plus you get a delicious salad with your meal so I actually think it's better than other places downtown.\n\nOn to the positives this pace is delicious and authentic!  Since traveling to Greece years ago I have been looking for an authentic spanakopita this is the ONLY place I have been to in the states including NYC and San Diego that have it!  The pastry is light and flakey oh my god it is sooooo amazing!!!!  I always order whatever specials they have and man it is ALWAYS totally worth it!  Now this IS authentic if you are looking for the American Version I can't confirm you'll like it though the ingredients and flavor combinations are phenomenal!  This is my favorite place in Ithaca.\n" u"I wasn't disappointed at all while with my experience at Sahara but the food and service could have been better. \n\nAlso pricy for the size of their entrees but again typical for Ithaca. I got the Sahara combination plate which included three skewers of the kabobs they offer: minced beef tenderloin and chicken. It was somewhat dry and too salty for my taste. They don't have many servers it seems and I wished I had  my water filled more often. Again not bad at all would still recommend for decent Mediterranean food.\n" u'Went for lunch on a busy Saturday afternoon. All the area restaurants had a long wait for our group of 5 adults and 2 kids except this one. Food good but the delay between ordering and getting our food was pretty long. Server was overwhelmed and kept forgetting things. Food itself was decent-hummus and babaganoush were standard Spanikopita tasty but small-portioned and buttery/greasy whole-wheat pitas were a bit dry/burnt Greek salad with chicken had sort of burnt chicken on it but the beef kebabs were quite delicious. Bathrooms clean though. Overpriced ok service decent food.\n' u"I now know how Chinese Americans feel when visiting your standard take out place. This is far from being authentic but I guess that is what happens when you cater to the American palate and call yourself 'Mediterranean'. You will like this is place if you are from the North East say hum-iss and think that tzatziki is better than tahini.  The food is bland the tahini is watery and the use of naan/gordita bread instead of pita is unforgivable. The labne tastes like philadelphia cream cheese and the kofta is missing the parsley and onions that it needs.The prices are also unwarranted given how small the dishes are but as others have said its standard for Ithaca.\n\nI might be a bit salty due to seeing 'dolmas' instead of 'warat'. It isn't bad food and chances are the standard consumer will find it enjoyable Just don't expect actual middle eastern dishes.\n" u'We were at Sahara for an early dinner and the place was empty.  Despite being one of the only two occupied tables service was a bit slow.  The food was not bad although probably a little overpriced.  We shared a spanakopita appetizer and a combination plate and we were satisfied.  We were never asked for our drink order.\n\nOverall I think you will find similar food quality perhaps with less of the ambiance at one of the smaller quick stop Mediterranean restaurants around town.\n' u'First impression is very nice nice lighting ambiance etc; however food is average...soups above average. Hoping I just wasn\'t hungry enough to rate higher but I\'ve been there three times now and....well just average. Intimate little bar that could be nice..if I drank but gave that up several years prior-had plenty. On the upside price was very reasonable service was pleasant and genuine. Dang I hate having to chastise a hometown restaurant when they\'re working hard to contribute to the great "post-graduate street-feel" of Aurora Street in Ithaca New York.\n' u'We waited for more than 35 minutes for our order. We never got it. We saw her walking around the restaurant catering to other people. We noted that she didn\'t put our order in the system. \n\nWhen we asked another waiter about our orders he went to the back to inquire about our food. We told him we decided to cancel our order. After a couple of seconds we figured we will not be getting our orders anytime soon.  We saw our waitress coming from the back of the restaurant with her hands FLAILING  in the air. As if to say she forgot about us. The other waiter approached us calmly and said "you guys taking off?" We said yes. \n\nOther customers noticed that we decided to leave. \n\nNo apologies. \nNo excuses. \nNo telling us when our food will come. \nWhat type of service is that?\n\nWe saw other customers who came in after us got their orders before us. \n\nSo what happened? No answer. Right. Do yourself a favor and pass over this place like what they did to us.\n' u"No kidding and non-trivial: Among the greatest French fries I've ever had. Falafel pita sandwich and falafel salad were outstanding too. Excellent service and thank God adequate air conditioning on this brutal August afternoon. Strongly recommended.\n" u"I've lived in Ithaca for years and like Mediterranean food but never made it to Sahara until today for lunch.  I had previously looked at the menu and thought it was pretty pricey. I was surprised there was no lunch menu.  While waitress was pleasant the service was so slow I had to rush to make it back to work.  The food was average $11-$12 for a simple felafel wrap. I thought about getting a plate but $18-24 is just too much for lunch.  The outdoor seating is nice but for most of the time we we're the only ones there while others restaurants on the street were mostly over half full.  I think that is telling.\n" u"Food was overpriced and mediocre. I got the chicken kabob pita sandwich which was DRENCHED in tahini sauce and I mean drenched. Not only was it dripping off the pocket there was a pool of the sauce on the plate. And the sauce wasn't good at all. There was hardly any flavor and just not good. \n\nThe wait for the waitress to ask for our order was very long despite only 3 other tables being occupied. Also a very long wait to get our food (chicken kabob pita pocket and a falafel sandwich) which seems like it shouldn't take so long to make. A couple who came after us walked out because the service was so poor. \n\nOne positive was both of our pita pockets were big and filling. I had several big pieces of chicken in mine and it was very full. The fries were good too. \n\nBut ultimately I would not come again or recommend this place.\n" u'Had Sunday afternoon lunch at the Sahara when visiting Ithaca.  Nice setting attentive waitress generous portions well-prepared food.  80s soundtrack was a weird vibe but everything else was enjoyable.\n' u"Me and a friend were seated quickly. I ordered a gyro and waited more than a half hour for our food to come out. My gyro wasn't made the greatest (lacked cucumbers onions and lettuce) and the sauce was poured only on one end of the gyro when it should have been distributed evenly throughout the gyro. Other than that the restaurant has a very calm and relaxing atmosphere with very friendly staff.\n" u'Friday night.  Got seated promptly though the three of us were crammed on our intimate 2-topper table.  This would not be a bad thing except...\n\nWaiter: Bored attitudinal hipster guy could barely be bothered.  This did not help the tiny table covered in dishes so we kept creating piles of plates just to make room.\n\nFood: Baba ghanoush was excellent.  Falafel portions were small and over-fried.  Companion had some kind of strange Greek-ish salad.  "It\'s not bad it\'s just not the Greek salad I\'m used to."   The kafta had nice flavor but was excessively dry.  Kafta jerky.  And the $7 bowl of lentil soup?  Total fail.  Thin anonymous broth with some lonely lentils tossed in.  $.07 of ingredients.  Hint from this bachelor cook:  Salt can make stuff taste good. \n\nMy wife gave the soup to the waiter and politely explained its limitations.  Did I mention his disengagement from his job?  Oh well at least it didn\'t appear on the check.\n\nSummary: Far too much money for far too little.\n' u"Server took the drink order from one person in our party. Left and came back with the drink. And never asked anyone else for their drink order. Off to an odd start. \n\nMediterranean platter (Appetizer trio) is a great deal. Choose any 3 and you nearly have a meal. \n\nI also ordered the lamb chops medium and they came out well done and dry. 2 of the 3 lamb chops were inedible. $24 for barely any meat is a complete rip-off. My server told me that they were cooked medium. \n\nBrought out the check without us asking so I guess we can't have coffee or dessert. \nTotal check came to $89 for lunch. Don't waste your time or money.\n" u"It was severely understaffed or maybe we caught it at the wrong moment. But it was one waitress with 8 tables half on their way out. She took our order. I started to see people who were seated after us get served. After a half hour I told a waiter who just came in we wanted to cancel he told the waitress and it appeared she didn't even give our order to the kitchen. Anyway the price point for the place looks pretty bad. I saw what was coming out of the kitchen. Nothing to note of the quality cause I never got served but it looked like food truck items for fine dining prices.\n" u'I had a fantastic meal at Sahara\'s and was surprised to see the mediocre reviews on here. The trick is to get lots of small plates to share which is how they are meant to be eaten. We ordered dolmas (very good) with Baba Ganoush (excellent) the mince meat kebab(best kebab) and gyro salad and shared it all. The gyro is unlike the Greek gyro I\'ve had in the past but is still tasty in its own right and far better than some other "gyro" I have encountered. Skip the pita bread and eat the hummus or baba alongside the kebab dolmas or falafel. The favors go perfectly together. A great place for healthy food even the most basic lemon and olive oil salad dressing is delicious here.\n' u'The Foule (a fava bean/lemony appetizer) was unique and healthy and delicious.  I will eat it for a mid east breakfast tomorrow.  The lentil soup was also quite yummy more on the thin side then on the chunky side of the soup spectrum.     The pita bread the tahini sauce the Greek saladthe chicken skewers were all good but not memorable.   We ended up here because Moosew ood had an hour wait (though it looked empty) and so I think I might carry over some of that disappointment into poor innocent Sahara.\n' u'Beautiful restaurant pleasant service. \nThe food was OK but not impressive. \nGet the fries instead of the salad.\n' u"We had lunch here - a Greek salad and a gyro. The wait was really long. Both to order and for our food. \nOur waitress was horrible ...my Greek salad came out without olives as well as onions.  I asked her why they weren't included on the salad. She tried to tell me that the olives were there and onions aren't included on salads. This was all wrong. I finally got what I wanted. But it's a little frustrating when you have to negotiate with your waitress. She also charged for a refill on my diet coke which I at least expected her to tell me there are no refills.\n\nThe gyro was just ok. Our salad was good once We got all the ingredients.\n" u'Though the food I have had here is decent I really dislike the fact that the management routinely obstructs the PUBLIC sidewalk with their restaurant tables chairs and chain posts. \nI have asked the servers/staff about this and they seem ignorant that pedestrians need space on the sidewalk and have been very defensive about their encroachment onto this city public sidewalk as if they can just set up their tables wherever they feel like. If you stop by here be sure to ask the management to stay inside the painted white lines and keep the public space open for people walking in wheelchairs with strollers i.e. open for the public.\nIf the tables and chairs are offered on the public space it seems they are free for the public to use--without ordering anything.\n']
136.Jimmy John‚Äôs,[u"I LOVE JIMMY JOHNS!!!!\nEverytime I'm in town this is where I come first. Here and Wegmans.. but Wegmans is a whole other story/category.\nI really wish there were Jimmy Johns further west than Colorado... \nI need a Jimmy Johns in LA post haste!!!\n" u"These guys are the unsung heroes of my life. Every time I go in they're smiling helpful and fast. They have turned around some of my worst days with their speed and enthusiasm. I have eaten countless #12s and my friends owe me quite a lot of money for the tuna clubs and Italian nightclubs (with peppers!) I have bought for them. Sure it's not fine dining but I have enjoyed every sandwich I have bought. I have converted to being a JJ's devotee after many years of Subway as my fallback lunch option. Thanks Jimmy; you keep me going.\n" u"I ordered a sandwich a drink and chips and waited over 20 minutes for delivery. I get a call saying that Cornell university was too far out of their delivery range so they can't deliver my sandwich. Wouldn't have been a problem if I was told this on the phone but I didn't appreciate how long it took them to realize that a 10 minute drive was too far. \n\nAnyone at Cornell don't order delivery!\n" u"My best friend hyped and raved about JJ's A LOT so when I stumbled upon this place after a pleasant dinner next door with my siblings I was most definitely excited!!\n\nI live in Long Island and there is not a JJ's nearby at all. The shop looked quite desolate with only one customer at a booth but it was pretty late at night. I ordered the Beach Club and asked if they could toast the bread. No can do. What? Awman. :( \n\nA little bit miffed I paid for the sandwich and as soon as I got back to my brother's house I immediately turned on the stove heating up a pan to a low heat. Yep. I toasted the sammie myself. That was just a *bit* annoying. \n\nThen I saddled the complete sammie on a plate and voila! http://bit.ly/14F15fB Yay I still couldn't wait to bite in! http://bit.ly/16PzD1x This delectable sammie included turkey breast avocado spread cucumber cheese lettuce tomato & mayo. The whole wheat bread was nice and thick. \n\nIt was decent but nothing jaw-dropping amazing. It was a good sandwich though....a sandwich I could make myself...and I almost did. Jeez. \n\nEhh. No matter how many sparkles and rainbows thrown at me it was pretty much just an average joe sandwich.\n" u"The delivery was fast I'll give them that but everything else was terrible.  I ordered a #4 that arrived quickly but when I opened it up it was just bread a small bit of avocado and a couple pieces of turkey no vegetables at all. I called and spoke to a manager who agreed to replace the sandwich but then it never came. Or at least it's been two hours and I haven't seen it. Will not be ordering from here again.\n" u"It's been -years- since I'd last been to Jimmy John's.  Having gone to undergrad in Evanston I remember all-too-frequently late-night meals here while working on one team project or another at ITEC (nee BIRL).\n\nIt's only appropriate that my most recent Jimmy John's visit was similarly with age-old college buddies also engineering majors and for a quick grub-and-go bite en route from one adventure to the next.\n\nAdmittedly I don't typically get stoked about going to a chain sandwicherie (unless it's Potbelly) but I'd forgotten just how much I liked Jimmy John's subs.  I mean... for the price it's a pretty good deal.  If you're a meatophile like I am you're likely to also love the #9 - it's chock full of salami capicola and ham.  And take their suggestion of adding hot peppers.  With plain oil and vinegar it's adds a nice little kick to the sandwich.\n\nBright clean and airy... they either don't intend to do high traffic here or people just grab-and-go because seating's pretty limited.  Definitely smaller than the Evanston shop I'm used to.  Still the decor's just as smart-ass and saucy as I remember; it's just my style!\n" u"I've dismissed this place as just another chain Subways or Quiznos for the longest time until I was told I was making a terrible assumption it's actually really great for grabbing a quick cheap and tasty sub sandwich.\n\nThe 8'' sandwiches are a bit on the small side if your getting a normal sized one but its certainly delicious who would of thought something as simple as a ham and cheese sandwich could be so good on a simple french bread. Start simple with the Pepe and work your way up.\n\nBest thing about this place is they deliver late too but running in and grabbing a sandwich takes less than 3 minutes. Win.\n" u"Not my favorite sub and for the price not the biggest nor does it have the most ingredients. But for $5.75 delivered to my work in usually under 25 minutes this cannot be beat. I love the flavor of the sub don't get me wrong but if I had time to run to Wegmans let me tell you I would. This place is great when you've got 30 mins for lunch and no time to pick anything up. They are FAST and the subs are good but like I said a little pricey. It works out in my mind though because they don't charge for delivery. So if the $5.75 sub was only worth $4.50 in my opinion I am paying $1.25 to have it delivered which justifies the purchase every time. I've ordered countless times from then for lunch at work and continue to do so and will continue to do so as they are the best for a quick lunch at work!\n" u'Sandwiches are super FAST most of the time. \nIf you are in a hurry and lazy these are the way to go.\n\nIn fact you probably already ordered and have your sandwich before you even read this review.\n\nLot of bread and lettuce not a lot of meat which is paper thin. \nSandwiches usually made the same but sometimes vary on level of condiments - sometimes they forget the mayo (or maybe they put way too much on sometimes and very little other times). With all that lettuce and little meat sometimes I feel like I am eating \n\nStill I eat there once a week!\n' u"JJ's is a pretty standard sub shop ... that I happen to enjoy very much.\n\nThe subs are always good consistant and I always get exactly what I ask for.\n\nWhilst a little pricey they are worth every dime. I have never had an issue with them making exactly what I ask for.\n\nThe #6 Veggie sub is my go to always consistantly made never over or under stuffed.\n\nJust good consistant not exactly cheap food.\n" u'In-store service is very good never long wait for the sandwich it is often done by the time you have paid and walked to the pick-up window.\n\nDeliver service is very unreliably and often awful. Their "freaky fast" service must only apply to the sandwich-making process because delivery often takes over 40 minutes to arrive.\n' u'Awesome little sandwich shop! Fresh bread delicious fresh ingredients and cheap too! Very courteous staff. Also very cool that they deliver. Even one sandwitch!\n' u"I came here about 4-5 years ago and I remember it being really good. Its deffinitly better then subway. Next time I'm in Ithaca I'm going to stop here again and I will update my review. I live on Long Island and there are none down here :'/\n" u"It's shocking when the sub shows up from across town five minutes after you get off the phone with them. Their delivery is fast.\n\nThe subs themselves kind of suck but it's hard to complain when they only costs $5 and the phone people and delivery people are great.\n" u'Considering I can get a delicious sub and chips for $7.00 within 60 seconds of walking in the door is amazing.\n']
173.Ithaca Diner,[u'Has always been a place to get very basic food- little effort to impart flavor into anything Was hoping for a slight elevation in the food quality upon the re-opening but alas no such luck. The only elevation was in the menu prices.\n']
14.Thai Basil,[u"This place has just gone through a mini renovation and looks so much more inviting. The food is wonderful and the service is great. The prices are very reasonable as well--another Thai place in town had raised their prices so much it wasn't a good value so I started coming here more often.\nI love the vegan and vegetarian options in the menu there are so many I keep forgetting which my new favorite item is!\nAlso the place is BYOB so coming in with a couple of brews or a bottle of wine complements my spicy meal very well!\n" u'DO NOT ORDER THE PAD THAI. It is horrible: mushy thin noodles very over cooked incredibly salty bad flavor little chicken.\n\nspicy udon is ok but AVOID THE PAD THAI\n' u'Ordered delivery from here. It was timely and hot upon arrival.\n\nI felt indifferent about everything we ordered and left more to be desired. \n\nMaybe an off day. Next time!\n' u"WE went here for dinner. It's  a cool spot in Ithica. I recommend the dumpling appetizer! Superb!\n\nMy wife got pad Thai which she said was great. I had the Red Drum 3 Rod. Basically a fish with veg and rice. It was so good! Sauce was outstanding. Highly recommend.\n" u'This is a good restaurant with varieties of delicious food. Service is fast food is great prices are good. The best thing about this place is they let you bring your own beer and drink.\n' u'First time visiting Thai Basil in Ithaca (usually go to a different one but based on honest reviews from my fellow Yelpers we wanted to try somewhere different). Glad we did as it was an excellent experience! Finally some authentic Thai food! I am a HUGE lover of Thai food and living in Corning you have to drive to Ithaca or Rochester for good authentic Thai food. I\'m just not a big fan of the Thai food served at the "Asian Fusion" places locally - it\'s not bad in a pinch but in no way compares to the Thai cuisine elsewhere.\n\nThe restaurant is not large but a nice combination of booths and tables and a pleasant atmosphere. We were greeted right away and sat at a booth.\nBEVERAGES: FYI- There is NO alcohol here (the front of the menu said BYOB?). We did not know this before we came and I had been looking forward to a Singha beer but we were fine with it as I was more excited for the food! I did order a Thai Iced Tea which if you\'ve never had one you should try it at least once in your life. I love Thai iced tea - it\'s a strongly brewed Ceylon tea sweetened with sugar poured over ice and topped (usually) with sweetened condensed milk before serving. \nAPPETIZERS: We had Thai fried spring rolls which were delicious and the Chicken Satay which was marinated and cooked perfectly. The cucumber and peanut sauces delicious.\nSOUP: I ordered the Tom Kha soup with tofu and vegetables (can get with meat also) which is one of my favorites. It was creamy and flavorful and tasty with nice chunks of mushroom tofu...etc. Excellent!\nENTREES: 2 of us had the Red Curry ordered extra spicy. Wow! It packed a serious punch! If you don\'t like super hot just order it regular. We\'re hot and spicy food fans so we loved it. Flavor was superb portion was very adequate. Chicken Fresh string beans red pepper..etc. Hubby had Nam Prik Pow with beef. He took one bite and was immediately sold. Nice spicy kick and the flavor was amazing! Daughter order chicken Pad Thai and she said it was one of the best she\'d had and she was definitely a fan. The presentations were beautiful the portions were plenty and the flavors of the dishes met and even exceeded our expectations. \nThe service was very good friendly and attentive. Always made sure our water glasses were filled plates cleared and check was promptly received when we were done. I have no complaints with our experience at Thai Basil. Wish they had a liquor license but that certainly would never stop me from visiting there again.\n' u"Have now had dine in and take out and can say this is unequivocally one of the best Thai restaurants I've eaten food from. The papaya salad is top notch bright and spicy with the right amount of juiciness and crunch. Their curries are perfectly seasoned and portioned with and this is rare and important lots of fresh delicious vegetables. Not just protein and a sad green pepper but lots of peppers and snappy green beans. This is true for both the green and the panang. The Thai basil stir fry is very special as well again because of the brightness and freshness signs of care that are reflected in the flavor.\n\nThis is where I will be eating Thai food from exclusively from now on for some in and delivery (which was super fast and delivered hot!)\n" u"We stopped here while visiting Ithaca last week. It was the best Panang curry I have every had. My partner had the pad Thai. He said it was the best he has had since working in a Thai Cafe. \n\nI felt really bad for the staff. There was a family with toddlers there that told them that the food was too spicy (if you don't like spice why are you eating Thai?). The staff kept asking everyone else there if the food was too spicy. We tried to reassure them that the food was delicious. I hope they don't change anything!\n" u'Thai Basil is one of THE best Thai restaurants I have ever been to. Food service presentation -- everything was excellent! \n\nThe Thai Iced Tea was delicious. It was just the right amount of sweetness after I stirred in the cream on top. I liked that their Thai Iced Tea is not the typical bright orange color you see in many restaurants. My only quip is that the straw was a little too short for the tall glass it came in. \n\nThe shrimp pineapple red curry I got was the most wonderful blend of flavors. Just the right amount of spicy and it had generous amounts of shrimp. I highly recommend it. My friend loved his chicken with oyster sauce.\n\nSuper fast service!\n' u'Very friendly staff family owned and operated.  They are happy to explain the dishes & offer suggestions. I enjoy spicy hot food and often order "hot" or 4/5 but here a medium or 3/5 is just right for me. \n\nI have enjoyed their Green & Panang curries the Emerald Salmon and their Drunken Noodles is excellent. My last time here I got Garlic Stir Fry and loved it! I feel the same about their Tom Yum Soup it has a very nice balance of lively flavors. You need to bring your own alcohol if you want that with dinner. The Thai Iced Tea is what I usually get. \n\nOverall the food is very good and it is very reasonably priced; it\'s now my favorite Thai place in Ithaca.\n' u"We went for a late lunch and it was incredible to say the least. The service was quick even though we ate at an awkward hour. \nWe wanted boba tea but when we found out that they didn't serve it there we settled for Thai tea and were not disappointed. \nI ate the crispy duck curry that was on the specials menu the spiciness scale goes from 1-10 and the 5 that I ordered left my mouth tingling but my eyes not quite watering.\n" u'I was craving for an authentic Thai food and what better dish to have than the most popular Thai steet-food Basil Pork. I ordered a lunch special Thai Basil Pork (Kra Prow) and made a special request for an authentic one. I also added a Thai-style fried egg which is normally served with Kra Prow in Thailand. \n\nThe food was delicious. The spicy ground pork meat infused with aromatic Thai basil and the crispy over-easy fried egg really reminded me of the food I had back in Thailand.  I personally recommend this dish to everyone who wants to try an authentic Thai food. \n\nOverall delicious food nice presentation great experience. The servers were also really welcoming and service-minded. Best Thai restaurant in Ithaca in my opinion.\n' u'I\'d be ok bumping this to 2.5 stars but I was mostly disappointed so I am choosing to "round down" my rating.  Spring rolls were blah. Tom kha soup was possibly better than average.  Pad Thai was heavy and me and my fianc\xe9 independently debated the true identity of the supposed "beef" in the pad thai.   Now pad Thai can often be heavy because it\'s a rich dish but in the end I still walked out knowing that I\'ve had much better.  \nThis place may suffice for a region deprived of great food choices (yes I can say that because I grew up close to Ithaca) but if you have eaten great food in major US cities you\'ll likely be disappointed with Thai Basil.\n' u"This was our family's first Thailand food experience and I was bit hesitant to try something new but that apprehension quickly faded! Once the food arrived at our table I knew we made a wise choice to dine at this establishment. The food was top notch as was the service.  One of our children was celebrating a birthday and the staff made it a very special occasion.   I would highly recommend this restaurant. Excellent food and excellent service.\n" u'Overall a good experience. Busy place! BYOB is a plus. Lots of vegetarian options. \n\nWhole red snapper (fried though you can order steamed) with basil was delicious!! Would come here again just for that dish. And reasonably priced at $22. \n\nDisappointed in the glass noodle pad Thai ($10.95). Not flavorful and very little chicken. Would not order again. \n\nVeggies and tofu in garlic sauce was delicious ($10.95) though the portion seemed smaller than other dishes. \n\nAppetizers: \n\nFresh summer roll was ehh - mostly iceberg lettuce but good mint flavor came through. \n\nFried calamari was good crispy coating and tender calamari inside. \n\nSom tum papaya salad was very good. Well seasoned good portion size of the vegetables. papaya seems to be mixed in with a lot of shredded cabbage and daikon. Comes with only two grilled shrimp though.\n' u'I was pleasantly surprised to find a Thai restaurant that truly is authentic and doesn\'t just say it without backing it up with taste. I\'m skeptical on finding a good Thai place with somewhat authentic food it\'s not easy especially in this area.\n\nSo so happy I found this place!\nAny Thai restaurant with Som Tum on the menu is already on the right track for me. If you like spicy and fresh "salad" this is something you MUST order. It\'s a spicy papaya salad with shrimp and it is one of my favorite dishes in Thailand. It taste like when I was visiting there so WOO HOO. \n\nI ordered Pad See Eew and yay yay yay! It tastes amazing! It is perfect like I was back home and had my mom cooking or I was in Thailand getting street food. If you don\'t like spicy and you enjoy sweeter tasting this is the dish for you. It\'s sweet flat noodles with tofu (or meat) Chinese broccoli and all sorts of yummy flavor. Others ordered the Pineapple curry and could taste the hint of pineapple with the medium spice (which is hot) and another friend ordered the Red Curry. All great meals.\n\nTons of seating and nice staff. They\'re actually Thai they speak Thai! It\'s a miracle to find it up here but now I know where to go. Thanks for making great food.\n' u"I thought the food was just ok not very spicy (I asked specifically for a spicy recommendation) and I actually didn't think it was very authentic\n" u'Sweet neighborhood family- run restaurant. Good ambience. Possibly under staffed as servers seem overwhelmed sometimes. I had the green Curry which had really good flavor. I was disappointed that it said it included eggplant but did not include eggplant. (Actually ordered this dish twice and neither time did it include eggplant as advertised.) My husband got the traditional Thai basil. He thought it was amazing. My son got the pad Thai and was very satisfied. The Tom Kha soup is also lovely and just what you expect.\n' u'So glad we found this spot for dinner!!\nFlavors were great! Mild still has a little kick to it.\n' u"Amazing food and service. Super authentic and fresh. This place was full the entire time I was there and several people waited for seats. That should tell you enough.  If you're in town eat here. Also there were MANY vegetarian options!\n"]
69.Gorgers Taco Shack,[u'Tacos are very good ... lunch special is total with it. . Lemonade plus 2 tacos and nachos for around 9 dollars !!\n\nPricing is reasonable .\nShop owners are friendly too and they have a wide variety of tacos\n' u"The folks behind Gorgers try their hand at tacos and burritos. At $8 for a huge burrito it's good value but flavorwise they're pretty meh. Better to head down the street and get a sandwich.\n" u"Just stopped here for a quick bite before ending our trip in the Finger Lakes.  Wow!  Really enjoyed the blueberry chipotle quesadilla.  I've lived most of my life in CA and AZ and this matched up with any of the mexican/southwest food they have there.\n" u'This place has amazing tacos. So underrated. My favorite is the pineapple taco. I would highly recommend it if you wanna grab a quick snack and then sit outside enjoy the atmosphere of the Commons. Staffs are super friendly and one of the nicest people.\n' u'These tacos are amazing & creative. They offer corn tortillas now for gluten-free customers and are actually transitioning to only corn tortillas for the tacos. Awesome!\n' u'Great tacos! Suer nice guys behind the counter. Great custom taco for my little one. Blueberry chipotle sauce is so so good! They manage to pull off the unique and it actually tastes great\n' u"I like the pineapple chipotle taco with pulled pork. Gorgers taco shack is fast and convenient especially when it's night time and I'm looking for a nice tasty and inexpensive snack. \n\nHowever: 2.70 taco is not LA prices. And please for the love of god Tacos do not belong on limp flour tortillas. They should come on a nice warm corn tortilla. This does not take a genius!\n" u'Tasty tasty tasty tons of taco and burrito choices I reccomend the corn relish taco great limeade.\n' u'Got fun and tasty 3 tacos for $7 - 5 stars\n\nGot some generic chips and a tiny cup of really good pico for $3 - 3 stars\n\nSo overall 4 stars when I go back I will skip the chips and salsa and just get another taco.\n' u"big fan 9 of the sub shop. hadn't been to the taco shack since it opened. originally had a few rotating options. now several taco choices nachos burrito bowls. fast good pretty cheap.  tacos much bigger than expected.\n" u"The upsides: really friendly people healthy fresh ingredients like spinach & cilantro unique & tasty salsas like blueberry chipotle. \n\nThe downsides: $8+tax for a VEGAN burrito (no meat no cheese no sour cream though it was quite large). The tortilla fell apart on consuming. \n\nThere were only two tables inside both in use (fortunately it was a nice day for eating out on the commons). \n\nWe'll try again though 'cause they were super nice & I like a place with fresh veggies.\n" u'I LOVE THIS PLACE and they know it. When you show up thrice a week people notice. The burrito bowls are outstanding and my favorite thing on the menu is the K tacos. Cilantro and peanuts? Weird but so incredibly tasty. And plus the guys behind the counter are kick ass and super nice. Dont leave without trying the ginger lemonade!\n' u'Gorgers is absolutely my favorite late night dining experience. Since I live a block and a half away from the restaurant whenever I am feeling late night munchies this is where you will find me. I love the quesa fresco nachos with pork - because sriracha and pulled pork make everything better. My boyfriend always gets a medley of tacos based on his mood and is always satisfied and loves them. From working at a farm to table burrito shop at home I can say that this is some of the better gourmet mexi-Cali in Ithaca and for reference I will always prefer over chipotle/moes/etc. My only complaint is not something easily changed by the restaurant. The location is across the street from moonies/other nearby baes which means every time I go there the workers are harassed by  drunk college students- which is hard to watch. Regardless gorgers tacos is definitely worth a try!\n' u'Fast fresh great tacos.  Enjoyed my creative take on a taco - chicken with sesame ginger peanut dressing with fresh cilantro.  Would Appreciate some beef options.\n' u'Just went down to gorges to try out one of their supposedly delicious burritos--I\'ve enjoyed the tacos there in the past and was excited to try a burrito.  For $8 I was literally handed a tortilla full of rice beans and nothing else.  The items that were supposed to be in the burrito were such a small representation that I couldn\'t even taste them.  The two gentlemen behind the counter seemed "to cool for school" and I had a terrible experience in lui of this all.\n' u"Exactly what I wanted. Well priced and delicious why are awesome little places like this so hard to find? Shout out to my sister Maddie for bringing me here I'll be back next time I'm in town for sure.\n" u"Really good tasty food. Wayyy to much food in the nachos for one person I definitely suggest sharing. Bummer how they don't have to go containers. Otherwise very good food. Wish they had more seating in doors. Fast service was a bonus too\n" u'This is a fantastic place for tacos in Ithaca. The food is good (fresh ingredients) and the service is fast. The prices are very reasonable. This is nothing fancy but it\'s good food at a fair price. Lots of options on the menu but I really like the "Option F" tacos with green onions cilantro and salsa verde. Very satisfying food! Definitely check this place out when you\'re on the commons. I would add a photo but it would be of an empty dish because I already ate them all...\n' u"This was a surprisingly bad place to eat. Like one bite and we're outta here bad. To me it seemed that someone used the meat from a can of Campbell's soup and stuffed it in a taco. Sauces were sickly sweet save for the pico which was pale tomato water. It has been a very long time since I've had a meal this poor and I was not going to force myself to finish it. Out ten bucks but I suppose it can serve as an example to others.\n" u"I dig it. They've got a ton of really creative and delicious creations here. \nI tried 3 different tacos. All were tasty. Apples in one. Blueberry BBQ sauce in another. \nI ordered mine vegetarian which means pinto beans instead of meat. I actually liked the beans. I also like that not everything relies on cheese to have flavor. \nI for one don't have a problem with the flour tortillas.\nPrice is good. $2.50 for one or 3 for $7.\n"]
23.Ithaca Bakery,[u"Menu on the board vast and impressive the various bagel options were amazing order taker - great service personality and helpful in making selections - disappointment was the delivery of a special order - sent it back and they just basically threw food differently on the plate; side of salmon was very small for the price paid - meal tasted delicious so my advice is stick to exactly what they have on the menu and don't try asking for anything special then you wont' be disappointed.\n" u"A large diverse selection of baked goods and foods to choose from.  Their bagels are stellar.  I bought one for breakfast and ended up going to get one to eat later that afternoon.  The jalapeno bagel is my recommendation.  A nice spicy flavor but not overpowering.  Paired with one of their carefully-crafted cream cheeses... yum.  \n\nThey get three stars because my dad didn't exactly care for his breakfast platter that he got from the buffet.  He ended up eating everything but was generally disappointed.  \n\nI'll re-visit and give it another chance but for now I left with mixed feelings.\n" u"Honestly Ithaca Bakery was kind of disappointing. Perhaps it was the overhyped reviews that did it for me. Also I rarely trust places with an overly extensive menu.\n\nI ordered J's Meal a breakfast sandwich with scrambled eggs portabella mushrooms and goat cheese among other things. I'm super disappointed that the eggs seemed like they were from a carton - the easy pour already whisked milk carton eggs. Also has the cook heard of salt? Nothing was salted! A huge nono according to the judges of Chopped. There was too much goat cheese in my opinion. Or maybe it was the lack of salt that made the goat cheese seem too overpowering. \n\nWe also got a pizza bagel. I don't know why that was a good idea at first. It's something I can make at home. It's something Bagel Bites does pretty darn well already.\n\nFor coffee I got the Cocoa Express. It was nothing special. It was pretty yummy though.\n" u"I have a love/hate relationship with Ithaca Bakery. Their selection of sandwiches and bakery items are hard to beat and the soup and hot bar selections can be pretty delicious... \n\n...that said there are two big cons: price and service. The sandwiches on the menu are pricey for what you get. Also it takes for-freakin'-ever for your food to get prepared even when there's barely anybody in the place. I'm not sure if it's because they're disorganized or just not effectively prepared for service on a regular basis but be prepared for a wait whenever you visit (even worse if it's at one of their prime service times). \n\nThere's also not a lot of space from which to wait for a takeout order unless you want to go wait at a table... and waiting at a table can be hit-or-miss because sometimes I'd had my name squeaked out so lightly into the microphone once my order *is* ready that neither my friend nor I heard it. \n\nAnd yet I still have favorite items from Ithaca Bakery (the Lindsay West End Melt or Stewart Parker among them...as well as the groundnut stew available from time to time as a soup option). I even stopped at this location once before heading to the airport to catch an initial flight for a trip to see my grandmother. My grandmother had worked at Cornell for years and she and her colleagues had been obsessed with the Southwest Sourdough bread. For my first trip to visit after she moved away from Ithaca I took a loaf of Southwest Sourdough down with me on the trip and she was giddy as could be about having one of her favorite breads from an Ithaca staple. \n\nTL;DR  I avoid it unless I have a very specific craving...that's the only time the price and wait time seem worth it.\n" u'My homie who lives in Ithaca told me that they had a bakery that had vegan options. I was excited to go and check it out for myself. Their have plenty of parking so you should not have any problems. When you enter one side has the seating area and the other side is separate into parts. \n\n\nPastry\n\nThis area has your typical bagels rolls and cakes. For vegans they have smoothies and fresh fruit juices. I try to see if they have vegan non dairy cakes but didn\'t see any. \n\nSalad \n\nYou can make your own salad or choose some of their delish options. Next to it their is a buffet section with hot and cold food. \n\nWraps \n\nFrom breakfast wraps to dinner. You will find it all. Next time I am here I will try one of their vegan wraps. \n\nSandwich \n\nI got the "Susie sandwich" it consists of seitan "chicken" slices tomatoes non dairy cheeseavocados bean sprouts on a oatmeal bread. Its pricey almost $9. When I went home to eat it I realize why it was pricey. The sandwich was big and fresh ingredients. The tasty was on the bland side. I had to put some sea salt on it. \n\n\nOverall it\'s a hip cool Bakery. I ask my friend how often she comes here. She said barely due to how pricey it is. But whenever I come to Ithaca I\'ll be coming here to try their different vegan options.\n' u"GREAT sandwiches. I had the turkey BLT but on French bread which was a winner substitution. The bread was sooooooo good! BF had the pulled pork which he loved as well.\n\nOnly downside is that the sandwiches don't come with any sort of side which makes them a little pricy for what you get I thought.\n" u"Great lunch spot just at the edge of downtown towards the lake.  Lots of great options here many fresh sandwich soup and other options. It can get a bit hectic but it's worth the wait. After the pretty good BBQ chicken sandwich The peanut butter chip cookies were really good.\n" u'This was one of my favorite spots in college and is one of my favorite spots to visit whenever I return. Ithaca Bakery has the BEST sandwiches in Ithaca hands-down and mic-drop. They are made fresh and their endless chalkboard of options and customizations allows for limitless opportunities to eat your heart out. Vegans Vegetarians and Carnivores can all find something to nom on. \n\nThere is tons of seating inside and a few tables available for outdoor eating. Parking can sometimes be a bit tricky but patience is well worth the wait or the walk.\n' u'Tuna melt was amazing\nEveryone at the table was very happy with their sandwich. Amazing place casual busy and not overly noisy\n' u'I pre-ordered an 8" half & half cake for my mom\'s birthday. The cake looked great and was ready when I came to pick it up but we ate it just a few hours later and it was super dry. The frosting fell off in a solid layer since it couldn\'t stick to the cake. I was very disappointed since Ithaca Bakery had such great reviews but I\'ll be going to back to Wegman\'s for cakes from now on.\n' u'Awesome bakery/market filled with all kinds of goodies! You can get everything here: coffee breakfast sandwiches grocery items baked goods local purveyors food items etc. It offers a bounty to choose from. We came in for breakfast and it was great. Our breakfast sandwiches were cooked to order. Extremely fresh and flavorful. The focaccia bread was perfect. The service was quick. Definitely would have been back here if we had another morning in town. Highly recommend anyone visiting the area.\n' u'I really really liked this place! If I lived in Ithaca I imagine I might come here a lot. So many yummy sounding menu items I\'d never get bored. And they had a fresh looking salad bar soups two cases chock full of treats and fresh baked bread! \n\nI had a hard time choosing what to order but felt like a hot sandwich so I chose the Parisian Panini. It did not disappoint; it tasted really good and was a satisfying lunch. The 3-fruit chutney was light and its  sweetness complemented the Brie spinach and turkey nicely. My teenage son ordered the West Willow BBQ & gobbled it all down in a hot minute. He topped off his meal with a key lime bar which he really liked. I tasted it and thought it was a little gelatinous  (thick solid texture vs. light) for my taste so I gave him the rest of my half. Their other bakery items looked good so I\'d probably choose something chocolate-y next time. If I\'d enjoyed the "treat" part of the meal more I\'d have bumped up to a five-star. \n\nWasn\'t too crowded when we came for lunch around 1:45 on a Thursday in early June. Friendly quick  service. Highly recommend if you find yourself in Ithaca!\n' u'Got the veganic wrap and it was just okay. Not very well seasoned and the portion was extremely small despite it being higher priced than an average wrap. I wanted to like it but two bites in I gave up.\n' u"Induces instant paralysis in newbies at least it did for this noob :) The Ithaca bakery makes hot fresh meaty (or vegan!) sandwiches brews great coffee drinks with Cayuga beans sells hot fresh food by the pound on a steam table makes cakes and pastries and oh yeah bakes a variety of rustic breads like a rosemary salt focaccia. Also offers many NY state cheeses plus an entire cold case dedicated to cream cheese for all kinds of College Town bagels! \n\nThe zillion sandwich choices are spread across more blackboards that I could count that's where the paralysis really set in but I finally chose a fine one: smoked salmon capers sprouts cream cheese and egg on pumpernickel bread. Outstanding but a tad spendy at $9. \n\nIf you're lucky you can grab a table and linger. Surprisingly quiet inside considering how busy it can get. Staff is young friendly and a bit disorganized but they hunt you and your number down eventually and bring food & drinks right to your table. \n\nVegetarian rating: solid five stars they have many veggie and vegan sandwich choices either on bread a bagel or a wrap.  The hot food bar has more choices including a bean burrito when I visited. \n\nHas the look of a food co-op that kind of crunchy granola feeling but they don't sell bulk grains or beans LOL.\n" u'Amazing sandwiches. Especially love the sandwich of the month with seasonal ingredients.  Pastries are good too and hot bar is convenient. Warm and friendly environment.  Not cheap but not outrageously priced either. Staff is friendly.\n' u'This should really be a 2.5....it all depends on what you hope to get here which depends on whether or not you would enjoy this place.  \n\nThe staff are all pretty nice.  I like being treated like a human being.  \n\nThe coffee is good.  Not too strong and not too watery-like.  I hate drinking burned coffee and many more places than Starbucks serves burned coffee (industry dirty secret).\n\nThe food:  depends on what you want.  Bagels w/ various toppings are excellent w/ lots of choices of cream cheese if that is your thing and they have nice looking lox.  \n\nThe breakfast hot bar.....I passed on this but my partner got it.  Everything is hard.  The problem of maintaining a hot food bar is to make sure the eggs are not continuing to cook and the potatoes don\'t get hard and form a rubbery crust.  We were too late getting here (9:20 a.m.).  The two types of local turkey and pork were flavorful but tough to eat.  The egg fritatta was hard and dried out.  He got the cold German potato salad and the potatoes weren\'t cooked right (hard) and the dressing on it was basically oil and fresh herbs but it was lacking seasoning.   \n\nI ordered the Melissa\'s Egg (egg/cheese on bagel) but substituted a croissant for the bagel.  I think the cheese is supposed to be cheddar but I got Swiss on mine for some reason.  The egg looked like an egg product - light yellow and lots of air pockets in the egg that looked like it was poured into a round small waffle press (the indentation of the egg on the top looked that way).  A bouncy plastic hard egg on a beautiful nicely made croissant.  I ended up tearing the egg off my second half and tossing it.  I have a stomach issue that makes eating well done eggs hard to get down.  I usually make soft scrambled eggs.\n\nMy partner remembers coming here 3 years ago and we enjoyed our lunch here.  We are wondering if this little gem was bought out and now become more corporate like.  It just doesn\'t seem the same now.  Think we\'ll try to find another breakfast place that is open on a Sunday (which is hard to do in this town) next time we\'re passing through.  photos to come soon.\n\nUGH....my fears confirmed thanks to a local long-time resident Laura who shared this about the so-called "local" food supporter Ithaca Bakery...."Sysco eggs that come in a god-knows-how-old-gigantic container!?  Ithaca Bakery I beg you get rid of this crap.  I can\'t be the only person this bothers."       thanks Laura should have dug more into the reviews before visiting again today.  Hope my egg sandwich doesn\'t harm me.\n' u"yummy cookies and breads!  I stop in every time I'm in Ithaca!\n" u'The book is still open on this place for me.  There were a lot of great looking menu items.  I am a sucker for a hot corn beef sandwich so that is what I had.  No frills just grain mustard on rye.  It was good but a little dryer and tougher than I like though seemed cooked fresh.  I like my corned beef steamed and juicy.  Since I am in town working near here I will try tomorrow.\n\nOne other thing.  You may want to check out the menu before you go.  It is substantial with coomplicated and interesting choices.\n' u"This bakery is possibly the most over hyped disorganized and slow place I've been.\n The menu creatively written on the walls is more arty than functional the racks and displays of various packages food items clutter the space. Combined with several places to order and little direction as where to wait for your order - its a veritable cluster to try to get food. \n\nAlso It shouldn't take 15 minutes to toast a bagel.\n" u'If you are looking for local and freshly baked bread .... they got it. Check out their site\n']
123.Five Guys,[u"It's not the most mind-blowing hamburger ever to exist in the universe but when you take what you get at Five Guys in a nice little package (the food the service and clean establishment) and consider the price for which you're getting it I'd call this a 5-star experience all day long.\n\nOnce you order from the almost-overwhelming list of toppings and remember not to over-order the fries (they give you huge quantities of fries) sit back and enjoy a fresh burger that's among the best you can find in Ithaca at any price. I don't have any complaints about the food other than that sometimes the cheese isn't melted on the burger... they just need to put it on the patty a little bit earlier in the process. At least you know your burger isn't going through an automated conveyor like at McDonald's.\n\nThe staff is always courteous and friendly... I don't see why it matters that they are younger and part-time as another reviewer pointed out. I don't know a lot of people whose career goal is working full-time at Five Guys. They are nice and committed to customer service--that's all that matters.\n" u'The food is great and the staff is literally the best. This is my favorite fast food spot in Ithaca.\n' u"These are the best burgers in Ithaca but that's not exactly a hard to get crown.\n\nFive Guys on Elmira Rd. is pretty much the only major burger-specialty place in the area that isn't a fast food joint so like many other Ithaca joints it kinda has a monopoly.  All the same it doesn't really abuse it - it's just as good as any Five Guys in any other area meaning you're guaranteed a pretty darn good burger a whole huge helping of fries and a decently clean restaurant.\n\nIf you want a good burger and don't want to slum it in a restaurant that doesn't do burgers regularly or that does them in a fancy manner (see: Stella's) this is your place.\n" u"Delicious. Truly my favorite burgers. They give you plenty of food I mean the fries are a meal themselves. I like crispy fries not necessarily the ones they serve. However fries are great in general and the burgers here are made to order.\nI discovered how delicious bbq sauce on a burger was at this restaurant. I hear they have milkshakes now. I am going to have to drive over sometime and have a full meal. Anyway stop in when you are in Ithaca and don't feel like going to downtown.\n" u"I mean it's five guys so it's obviously good right? This location is super speedy and has tons of seating - I've never had a problem getting a table or waiting too long even when the line is almost out the door. I always get my usual cheeseburger and add all the toppings because I can and its delicious. Plus they have free unlimited peanuts! Also you can flavor the fries which is delicious!\n" u"Ever so very ~meh~. First visit to a Five Guys wished I went to Wendy's instead. Overpriced and average. Fries were almost burnt. Won't visit another 5 guys.\n" u'So good. Not good if you are allergic to treenuts. But if you are blissfully able to eat treenuts you must have these delicious cheese sandwiches. A longtime vegetarian this is my favorite place to get burgers/sandwiches with my meat eating friends. Do yourself a favor; spend 6$ and get yourself a combo delicious peanut infused meal.\n' u"The burger quality here is somewhat inconsistent.  Sometimes they're bitter and dry and sometimes I can't put em' down.  Nonetheless I'd say Five Guys makes the best burgers you'll find in Ithaca.  Doesn't compare to a certain other regional burger chain but if you need your fix in CNY there's no better place.\n\nAs for the fries some people swear by them but I'm not a fan of their style.  If you like softer oily fries then these are for you.  They taste homemade I'll give them that but in my opinion that isn't always a good thing.\n" u"This is by far my favorite place to get a burger. Consistently friendly service great food and cleanliness. A person can not ask for much more in a fast food chain. I love that this place is located where it is. It's not too far away and the environment is welcoming.\n" u"Five Guys always serves great food. The hamburgers are so... homemade. Everything there tastes homey which is why I love it. It tastes very genuine and just DELICIOUS. I am seriously craving Five Guys as I'm writing this.\n" u"Greasy goodness tossed with all the ingredients you love onto a great thick wheat bun. Wow I am from Cali so I wasn't phased by all of the hype (there's now a 5 Guys where I live  too woohoo).\n\nI am so impressed the quality of the burger and fries is definitely in its own category only eclipsed by Inn-N-Out. Although a lot of people will argue they're too different to truly compare I think 5 Guys just doesn't have that specialness of Inn-N-Out and their animal style-ness. \n\nI had 2 burgers in one sitting :) I WAS FAMISHED. For something pretty special try bbq sauce + hot sauce it tasted great. Also they give you huge servings of fries. Get the cajun fries and stick those bad boys in some ketchup and vinegar (I know weird right? It tastes great though). \n\n5 Guys is a cult favorite that you have to experience in Ithaca. For a nice greasy experience go here. Just make sure you head to the gym afterwards.\n" u"I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else for a quick burger ... I'll even dare to say that it's better than Shake Shack in NYC [to the potential horror of all the students in Ithaca that are from the city]!  Mainly because less than $10 will get you plenty of food for one person w/tons of delicious fries left over. =)\n\nI was so excited to try Five Guys for the very first time - right here in Ithaca on their opening day!  I heard some mixed reviews from friends about this place in different cities but I was quite impressed with the quality of their burgers & fresh-cut fries!  For the cost ($8-10 for a HUGE one-person meal) I think it's a really good deal: you get to choose whatever toppings/condiments you want (and as many as you want) on your burger from jalape\xf1os to grilled mushrooms. Plus a regular sized fry could very well feed 2-3 people ... especially when you have a giant burger to finish!  The Cajun fries had a kick but were even good as leftovers for the next week!  A regular burger comes with 2 patties but I thought the mini (one patty) with all the fixings + sharing fries with my other two friends and a drink was more than enough for a meal. \n\nI'll be back there soon since all my friends keep wanting to go!\n" u'So overrated. All the hype to which the place doesn\'t really live up to.\n\nFirst of all ... what kind of burger place serve their customer their burgers with SOGGYbuns? Opening the wrapper within 5 min of leaving the shop we came across with  quite mediocre SOGGY and all-around disappointing burgers - I didn\'t really think there was anything outstanding about it. OK yes it\'s maybe just *slightly* better than McDonald\'s but wow - the difference is really paper-thin.  \n\n(My son reading this review exclaimed "What? I think McDonald\'s better!"  He couldn\'t finish the burger.  This is a tell-tale sign of failure. But I give it that FG is ever so slightly healthier than McDonald). \n\nI also should mention that whoever packed our bag put the fries in a cup UPSIDE DOWN - well thank you.  A nice touch.\n\nI think Glenwood Pines Restaurant by Taughannock Falls serves a burger x15 times better than this one - and the price is not all that different as I remember. \n\nAnd potatoes from Idaho? C\'mon - that sounds so fresh local and sustainable - that this sound enticing to most people with poisoned mind is the problem of the  world today we need to all think about. \n\nThe cashier and the guy who handed me the burger were young part-timers - just like McDonald\'s.  I find them sort of rude especially the guy when he refused to take my receipt since I didn\'t need it any more. I also wonder if the same guy put our fries UPSIDE DOWN.\n\nThumbs down all the way.\n' u"I have been to Five Guys joints across America and I have to say that the people who are working at the Ithaca Five Guys Burgers and Fries are the most friendly of any I've ever met. They make me want to come back to the place. Of course the burgers are awesome and the fries are to die for. I only wish it wasn't right by too busy busy busy route 13.\n" u"I lived in NYC for many years and was a regular at Shake Shack; I've also recently experienced Byron in the UK. Five Guys falls somewhere in between them - which is to say it's probably the best burger chain in the US right now and among the top in the world. Sure there are independent restaurants where you can get a better burger but (in Ithaca at least) not as fast food unless you order take out. That said it's unfortunate this location is located out in the suburban sticks beyond Wegmans and not in a space accessible via public transit or foot; I'm sure they'd get a lot more business from college kids with cash to burn if it were in downtown Ithaca or Collegetown within walking distance of Cornell.\n" u'Some of the best burgers in ithaca. What can I say? Its a 5 Guys its a franchise and its standardized as to what they serve and how things will taste. Health is not a factor in this review obviously.\n' u'So just an update on the franchise as a whole...I went to Five Guys at LaGuardia airport last week and thought "it\'ll be good but probably not as good and the prices will be higher most likely"...First off they weren\'t higher and secondly it was just as good as every other five guys which let me tell you surprised the heck out of me! They continue to be the best anywhere I go and it just reaffirms my position that Five Guys is one of the BEST places to get a burger. Keep on keeping on Five Guys cause you rule!\n' u'I was lucky enough to have a friend invite me to the Five Guys "Friends & Family" training night right before Five Guys opened in Ithaca and they\'re off to a fantastic start!\n\nFive Guys focuses on just hamburgers hot dogs and french fries and they pride themselves on quality and fresh ingredients. There\'s even a sign to tell you where today\'s potatoes came from. (Tonight\'s were from Sugar City Idaho.)\n\nThe burgers are all in the $3-6 range a large fries will easily feed three and it\'ll be easy to feed the family for $5-8 per person. For a meal at fast-food prices this is outstanding. The burger\'s top-notch and the hand-cut fries are hot and crisp. (The Cajun ones have a real kick too.)\n\nI\'ve written more at 14850 Dining and definitely encourage everyone to visit Five Guys.\n\nhttp://dining.14850.com/reviews/r_fiveguys.html\n' u'The only "fast" place I\'ll order a burger aside from In-n-Out. Delicious quality every time. Well done and juicy just like the sign says. Very enjoyable. I always order a little cheeseburger and share a regular fry no soda. The peanuts are super especially when the line is long. Definitely kid friendly too.\n' u"This is like any other Five Guys restaurant: fresh burgers insane amount of fries and peanuts everywhere. If you like the kind of burger they make then you'll like this place.\n\nThere are a few things different form this one than the one I went to in NYC. The staff seem to do a better job at keeping the place clean; a staff member is out frequently wiping tables returning the condiments back to the serving table and picking up trash. \n\nAnother thing is that you can request that you don't get a topper of fries. It cuts back the amount so instead of 3 meals worth you only get 1.5 which for one person cuts down on the amount of food you have to save or throw out when you're done eating.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is that there are no trays at the Ithaca store; everything ends up in a bag. I really like that because it makes it easy to get the malt vinegar distributed on the fries. \n\nA decent place to eat. Nothing really notable but nothing bad either.\n"]
101.Star Truck,[u"My favorite lunch spot. Everything on the menu is delish but the garbage dog is my favorite. You definitely don't need to be vegan to enjoy the food!\n" u'Garbage dog all the way! Veggie dog coleslaw cauliflower bbq soy curls and  vegan mac and cheese? Yes please! This truck saved me at Grassroots was eating too much fried food but still wanted something comforting and filling. I told my spouse the mac and cheese was vegan she made a scrunchy face then tried it-- she was impressed! Hope to catch them in Ithaca sometime or maybe at Grassroots again next year.\n' u'With zero vegan restaurants in all of Ithaca NY the Star Truck has become a regular outing for my family of four vegans! We love the dogs and burgers and nachos and always look forward to any specials Tammie and her crew have cooked up. \n\nI highly recommend stopping by and "engaging" your taste buds to warp speed 11. Make it so.\n' u'What is there not to like? They serve plant-based foods at a reasonable truck price. My son and I had garbage nachos and scorpion sandwich both were delicious! Live Long and Prosper!\n' u"Friendly service nice vegan fare. They have a limited menu which I think is an advantage - I prefer when places do a few things well rather than offer a lot of mediocre options.\n\nWe really liked our mac-n-cheez bbq soy tacos and buffalo soy burger.  We were also pleasantly surprised by the prices - $5 each for the tacos and burger and $6 for the mac - which are lower than other vegan trucks we've been to around the country.\n\nThe food was lovingly made and the service was friendly. Bonus for being the only vegan establishment in town. I'd definitely come back if I were in town again.\n" u"I was visiting the Finger Lakes for wine tasting for my birthday and specifically chose to come to the Cayuga Lake area because of the vegan options available in Ithaca. There aren't many but compared to where I come from the few are more than I'm used to. I saw the reviews for the vegan food truck online and visited their website and loved the idea and everything about it so I put it on my list of places to eat. I went there today and shared a plate of the garbage nachos and a small side of Mac and cheese with my girlfriend. Both of us who are coming close to being a year vegan absolutely LOVED it. If you're looking for a fancier healthy version of vegan food this probably isn't for you but we aren't vegans for the health benefits we are strictly vegans for our love of animals. If that's the case with you I would absolutely recommend it! It was fabulous. I love the idea of a quick easy stop for vegan meals. I wish I had one of these lovely cruelty free food trucks in my area! \n\n* I would rate it a 4 1/2 but my phone seems to only let me do full star ratings so I rate it a 4 because I wish there was a small seating area to eat outside the truck. Even if it was just a fold up easy to store chair and table. We had to eat our food in our car with our pup. He got to lick the leftover cheese sauce though and absolutely loved it!\n" u"Star Truck is some of the best food in town. \nI very much enjoy their 'comfort food' approach to vegan food. Meaning their focus is on making the food super delicious.\nI've eaten there probably 5 times and have never gotten anything I didn't like. \nEveryone should check it out weather you're vegan or not.\n" u"Such great food! There is of course the basic Mac n' Chee but there are so many other options including grilled cauliflower or the nacho platter. Don't forget about your greens! You can even get them with some Chee on top!\n\nI love your variety of Plant-based Foods!\n" u"Holy balls! I got a wrap from there guys (the special two days ago) and it was one of my favorite wraps of all time. I'm a meat eat so I was really skeptical about this place. Then stopped by randomly when I got out early from work (honestly forgot it was vegetarian until after I ordered) and got this little $5 wrap. Not expecting much I took a bite and it knocked my socks off. Keep up the good work and don't be afraid even if you are a avid meat lover like me!\n" u'What a wonderful place! Love the garbage dog and the vegan mac and cheeze. So many condiments to flavor your food with that the mind boggles. Everything fresh made to order and delicious. Also the idea of supporting this Enterprising young woman really appeals.\n' u'I love everything I\'ve had so far but our family favorite (we have a toddler) has been the delicious mac and cheese we got with the sauce poured on top instead of mixed in (clever). I also really dig the cheeseburger which is like a fast food burger in the best possible way - the crunchy pickle the sauces everything about it is so authentic minus the animal lover\'s guilt I had when I last ate the "real thing" over a decade ago. Yum.\n' u"Visiting Ithaca once a year I was happy to find a vegan source for food by GreenStar market.  Super fab nachos!!  Can't wait to try the other food options.\n" u'I\'ve eaten at the Star Truck 4 times and was so excited to hear that an all-vegan food truck was in Ithaca!  The possibilities are endless!  The first time was definitely the best.  They were serving a great veggie burger that was absolutely perfect. \n\nSince then I\'ve been consistently disappointed.  Everything is under-seasoned.  Food often tastes on the edge of being raw especially things like griddled cauliflower or kale and cabbage.  The "mac-and-chee" (sidebar: I hate when vegan food have cutsie fake names for dairy or meat substitutes ... pet peeve of mine) is a bland gummy sauce over boiled and quickly-heated-up-on-the-flat-iron elbow noodles. Their BBQ taco was overloaded with so much sweet sauce I couldn\'t even taste anything but that.  Their garbage nachos and garbage dog are the same ... you\'d have to be drunk to appreciate it.  The last time I ordered when I was on lunch at work I ended up bringing home two sides in order to incorporate them with something I was cooking for dinner so I didn\'t throw them away ... talk about a waste of time and money considering I had the same ingredients at home but was looking for a quick meal.\n\nThey also don\'t consistently use Facebook to post what their specials are ... I\'d be much more apt to visit if I knew ahead what was in store.\n\nIf you\'re absolutely starving then this will do.  Otherwise I\'ve had much better vegan food.  Sadly this all-vegan truck is not worth the traffic to visit.  Unless they have their veggie burger on special!\n' u"The 1 star that I give them is for the great service. I would rather go to McDonalds and eat hamburger buns than this. I've eaten here 3 times now hoping it will get better but never does usually the experience is worse than the prior time. I love the idea behind a vegan food truck but I'm looking for food not garbage.\n"]
108.The Rose,[u"We were hesitant to visit The Rose because of the hit-or-miss reviews but we've been there twice now and had great experiences.\n\nThe food is pretty good and I'd say it rises above the level of national chains that serve burgers and steaks. The menu is a bit of a conundrum as it also contains a few Mexican dishes some pasta dishes and many other things. This is probably a place where you need to know what to order as they probably don't knock all of those things out of the park. We've stuck to burgers meatloaf and other typical American food and been rewarded. \n\nThe servers are also very nice and generally fast. The place is actually quite huge but has never been crowded any time we've been there. There is a large bar area where a lot of people seem to be hanging out on any given night so I assume they have their regulars.\n\nIf you're in the Triphammer area and in the mood for a burger or steak definitely try it out.\n" u'Forced to go here on lunch through work and it was very sub par.  The ambiance is dreadful with decorations going back to the 80\'s and it also appears to not have been touched since then.  I had the lunch buffet and it was underwhelming.  It included a few pieces of dried out pizza some sort of chicken "fingers" (might actually be a finger) bland pasta murdered veggies and stale tater tots.  The salad bar consisted of standard lettuce many salad fixings and a bunch of dressings.  Items were included on top of the sneeze guard which sort of defeats the purpose. It was acceptable due to the low price but very standard and no inspiration.  It\'s TGIF\'s ugly little stepsister.\n' u"Can't speak to the sit-down/service part of The Rose but ordered fish & chips to go and it was excellent.\n" u"This was probably the worst meal I've had in Ithaca. The French dip was 11 dollars and it tasted like it was something from a microwave. Buffalo cheese dip is hard to get wrong but they managed to get this wrong as well. My wife's tacos were not good as well. Cabbage not fresh sour cream was old.  We didn't complain but we sure will not return next visit to Ithaca.\n" u'They overcharged me.\n\nI am a 3 years customer. I went there for lunch all the times also dinner. But last time they overcharged me 15.99 for fish and chip but on the menu is 14.99. You get it and you will understand how I feel. It was not about money and it was about trust in this restaurant in the whole picture.\n' u"This is one of the few good old-fashioned restaurants left in the Ithaca area.  I've got nothing against all the various ethnic and specialty restaurants in the area but The Rose still has a very diversified menu.  And all of it is good.  I have dinner there several times per year.  Never a disappointment.  Staff is prompt and courteous.\n\nIt is very popular make a reservation for any night but especially Friday and Saturday.\n\nOnly one problem...they seem to shift back and forth on being open on Sundays.  The last time I tried to go on a Sunday they were closed but just a few months earlier they were open.  So if you want to go on Sunday call them first.\n\nRegardless of what day you go you won't be disappointed\n" u"I have had a few bad experiences here and reluctantly went back again tonight with my parents. The place feels really dirty. It's dark and the decor looks ancient. \n\nThe food is also uniformly bland. I haven't had a single enjoyable plate there. Today I just got the classic chicken sandwich hoping that they couldn't mess up such a simple dish. However it was really tasteless and there was something that appeared to be a piece of plastic in the sandwich. Disgusting. \n\nThe service was unnecessarily slow considering how few people were there. I asked for ranch dressing for my fries and never got any. My parents and I sat for ten or fifteen minutes with empty plates before our check was brought to us. Save yourself the trouble and go to Ithaca Bakery which is right next door and knows how to make a chicken sandwich.\n" u'The staff is always pleasant. My kids love the Hammy Mac & Cheese along with the salad bar. My favorite there is steak mashed potatoes and chunky homemade apple sauce. Overall great place.\n' u"Well the place was open. The staff wasn't rude. I had my choice of places to sit. The beer was wet. That's about all the good I can say. If you have no other choice then it'll work.\n" u"So to start off the visual appeal of this place needs to be revamped. I felt like it was just run down and forgotten so to say but the server was very nice and we had a 10% off coupon so why not try it.\n\nWe ordered our drinks and were brought them very promptly. The menu was good but I feel like it was out of place. They have pub type food then restaurant type entrees and then 4-5 Mexican offerings? What? I totally question why they have this part of the menu as it really does not go well with what they are trying to do but hey whatever. \n\nWe ordered the buffalo wing dip and 12 honey mustard w/bbq sauce wings for an app and they were both pretty darn good! The dip was good the chips were going stale but weren't there yet so it was still good. The wings though...man they were good.\n\nLots of meat on these with lots of flavors and they were big! The price was only 8.99 for a dozen. This was crazy good. Honestly this is my new favorite place for wings.\n\nI ordered the burger my wife ordered the chicken fingers and my friend ordered their pot roast. The burger was good nothing great but better than I thought it would've been. It's got some good seasoning to it cooked perfectly. Plenty of lettuce and tomato and mayo and genuinely was a good burger definitely not a top 10 though.\n\nThe chicken fingers I tried and really it is hard to mess this one up but they were pretty darn good. the Fries were pretty darn good too better than a lot of places. My friend said the pot roast was okay but it was just beef and gravy. Usually you would expect carrots and celery or some sort of veggie with it but it just came with meat gravy and potatoes which isn't bad.\n\nOverall I would come back for the wings and fries again and again and again but that's probably it probably would get the dip again too as for entrees probably not so much. Definitely hit it up of your looking for good wings in Ithaca though!\n" u"I've been to the rose before and was somewhat satisfied with the food. Just visited today to have lunch with my brother for his birthday. Horrible choice. His fish sandwich was disgusting. He had one bite and was done. Our waiter was horrible. Didn't come by our table to ask how things were even once only to get our orders and give us our check. I got the shrimp and scallop fettuccini alfredo. My food was so hot that I couldn't eat it until after everyone was almost done with their food. So I had about two bites before we got our check and left. I won't be coming back. Horrible service horrible food.\n" u'Stopped in for a late lunch today. It was very quiet so we got to pick where we sat. Our food was good but average. Everything was hot and served in a timely manner.  Our server was nice but would forget things leave the table come back and ask what we had said. Probably should have been more attentive since it was so slow.\n' u"Relaxed small town atmosphere. If you're looking for very reasonable drink prices this is the place. They also provide basic munchies which higher priced joints don't since they want you to buy their expensive apps.\n" u"There are zero reasons to eat here.  The food is uniformly bad and the place feels dirty.  At least the service was usually fine.\n\nIf you want a burger go to Ruloff's or Glenwood Pines.  If you want comfort food go to Moosewood or Joe's.\n" u"Food is okay--  Ruby Tuesdays or TGIFriday's type of place but not as good.  Don't go expecting anything wonderful.  Salad bar is nice clean and a good value.  I like it because it's never loud/crowded and convenient.  Wouldn't go out of my way to go here but it is good when you just want a burger sandwich or salad and not a lot of hassle.\n" u'I go here for the salad bar.  It\'s the only place in Ithaca with one (that I know of).  It\'s clean and kept fresh even though just about everyone goes to it.  If my rating was on the salad bar alone I would give it 5 stars.\n\nThe rest of the food is average.  Their "comfort food" is better than their attempts at higher end food like the scallops.  Their desserts...I learned my lesson long ago and never order desserts here and I have a MAJOR sweet tooth.  They are just not good.  \n\nBar area is nice.  A few tv\'s around so you can watch what you want without too many problems.  Bartenders are nice.  It\'s not so loud that you can\'t hear people you want to talk to.\n\nService is good.  Friendly staff and doesn\'t seem like a lot of turnover.  They recently got rid of the ancient fake-newspaper table cloths and the table underneath are beautiful!!  I don\'t know why they didn\'t do it sooner.  Lots of framed newspapers on the wall which I personally don\'t like but I suppose it\'s to show the length of time they\'ve been there and connection to the community especially Cornell men\'s ice hockey.  But what\'s with the bobble head looking things above the tables??\n\nOverall good place to go for a beer salad burgers sandwiches.\n' u"My wife and I LOVE The Rose. Hit it up on a Wednesday night treat yourself right-2 for 1 wine night. The people couldn't be more interesting the music is KILLING nice selection of beers on tap. Salad bar is nice burgers are good. We love the atmosphere of the place. Friendly waitstaff the de-facto sports bar now that Benchwarmers went MIA and Uncle Joe's is NOT somewhere I'd bring my wife.\n" u'Meh is right... Meh food Meh Service Meh cleanliness Slightly not Meh Salad Bar.\n\nWe eat here once a year and when we leave we always remember why we only eat here once a year.  I cannot imagine how old the fake newspaper tableclothes are I remember them from when I was a kid...\n' u'The bar tender was very helpful but the food was not good burger was WAY undercooked but burnt on the outside.  The crowd was also an interesting hodgepodge of people.  All in all at least they were open vs a lot of other places in Ithica that close before midnight.\n' u"Well I'm full. The rose attempts to do it all but none of it well.  I ordered a steak. It was cooked medium as I had ordered. It was not seasoned at all. The scallops were okay. The potato salad was bland as hell.  Ack.  My wife salad was cold tiny steak strips limp bacon she was not impressed.   It was food.  I am here on a trip.  Locals maybe you know better.  The rose needs to focus. It was a Friday night and the dining rooms was rather sparse.  The bar area was busy.\n"]
142.Chinese Buffet Restaurant,[u"i'm not a snob when it comes to chinese food. and seeing as how i'm american i don't mind the americanized version of chinese food. breaded and fried chicken in a sweet/spicy sauce? hell yeah! this place has a lot of that to offer. well actually that's about 80% of what they have to offer. this place is kind of funny like that tons of chicken dishes a couple beef dishes and not much pork. i think there was some sushi there but i don't pay attention to that. \n\ni liked the coconut chicken the honey chicken and then there was another one i liked but i can't remember what it was. the emporers chicken general tsos and sesame chicken were all pretty medicore i didn't even get those the 2nd time i went. the sweet and sour chicken was average. they have a BBQ chicken as well but i don't know why they call it that because it's not smoked and there's no bbq sauce on it. i liked the chicken dumplings too and the meatballs in garlic sauce were ok as were the pork eggrolls. the wings were different both times i went the first time they were big and breaded and the 2nd time they were small and breaded. also this is the first time i went to a chinese buffet and didn't see any pizza which is fine by me because chinese buffet pizza usually sucks. the desserts are kinda funny they have cheese puffs and cool ranch doritos out but they also have the standard cakes cookies jello and pudding. they also have hard ice cream and soft serve. i went with the soft serve in a cone and i thought it was pretty good. \n\nboth times i went the service was pretty good they were polite and quick to refill my water and take away empty plates. i didn't notice anything unsanitary like some of the other reviewers and so for just over $10 for a dinner buffet this place is worth going to if you're looking to stuff your face\n" u"The food In a word- disgusting. The staff- rude. If it were this or a gas station it'd be a toss up.\n" u'Despite being a Chinese buffet only about half the food is actually Chinese. The counter has lots of American stuff (potato wedges mac and cheese etc.) sushi and the typical unauthentic Chinese stuff which is catered to Americans. My friend said he once saw pepperoni pizza served in one of the trays?\n\nFood is mediocre at best but the buffet is ridiculously cheap. I gave them a generous tip (the service was pretty good to our group) and it was still just $8.50.\n' u'To start out most of the food is typical food-service grade Chinese buffet stuff. You\'ve had this sesame chicken and lo mein before many times over. Everything is served at a disgusting luke-warm temperature which I can barely fathom even being possible considering how fast they seem to rotate through dishes on the buffet line. That means nothing is being cooked fresh and that it\'s all sitting lukewarm in the kitchen for god knows how long before they bring it out. None of it is really... awful... but it\'s just barely warm and therefore unappetizing. The sushi is so low-grade it\'s not even funny or worth calling sushi. \n\nThere are some head-scratching oddities here. A metal tray of Doritos? Bottles of hand-labeled mystery substances named things like "hand-made sauce". I mean really? Are you going to pick up a bottle of that and actually put it on your plate? I did sample the "wasabi sauce" and the "hot mustard sauce" since lacking even a courtesy bottle of sriracha might have lent some flavor (and heat) to the food. But these were not in color taste or texture anything resembling wasabi or hot mustard.\n\nI don\'t know what I put in my mouth and that is something you should never be saying after going to a restaurant.\n\nCleanliness is a serious issue here as well. Some lady with a wet hacking cough was carrying buffet trays into the kitchen which means at some point she was surely carrying them out full of food. Getting a plate or bowl is kind of a Choose Your Own Adventure.. 1 out of 5 is what I would consider even passing cleanliness the rest have food still on them and don\'t look like they even got washed with water let alone detergent. And woe be to the person who gets a look at the bottom of the tray where the "clean" dishes are stacked. I think I saw food remains from 1979 down there.\n\nJust don\'t go here unless you can mindlessly stuff food in your mouth and ignore all the red flags around you and someone else is paying.\n' u'After hiking Watkins Glen on vacation we were hungry- buffet hungry. So we searched high and low for a buffet while we drove back and this seemed like the only option.\nWell maybe we should have been more patient and eaten at any other restaurant that serves Asian food. It was like the other reviews say: ordinary at best. The service was freindly. The place was about as clean as most strip mall buffets. They had sushi American and Chinese food.  It was all just run of the mill saucy salty buffet food. The honey chicken and the seafood delight were the best. Some parts were mismatched. For instance they had lettuce cucumber and five bottles of ranch dressing but no other salad toppings. It was ok but the saving grace was that it was only $20 for both of us to eat.\nWe agreed that buffets are just too hit or miss on vacation. This one just was a miss.\n' u'I have been to this buffet many times since it opened 25 years ago (see my previous review of 10/27/15) and most of the time it is pretty good.  The last few times I\'ve been there for dinner it\'s been iffy.  I was there on July 20 2016 and it was a severe disappointment.   It was a Wednesday night and very hot and humid outside.  There were very few people there and it was prime time for dinner a little past 6:00 PM when we arrived.  Of the many dishes they had few had been refreshed or replenished in hours.  Many were lukewarm at best.  It was like they saved it from lunch.  I was hungry when I left because there were so few things to really eat.  We stayed for over an hour until past 7:00 and it only got better marginally.  When they did upgrade a dish or two it was a small quantity.  The dumplings which were cold and hard had about seven new ones added to it.  They never added more to the Mei Fun.  The Tofu dish looked old crusty and unappetizing. I heard people behind me complaining about the food as well. Now I realize that sparse attendance on that night might have been responsible (they didn\'t want to make a lot of new food and have it go to waste I suppose) but the owners should have been ashamed of themselves.  It wasn\'t like it was 3:00 in the afternoon or 9:00 at night...this was prime time for a dinner buffet.  To top it off I witnessed something very disgusting which I should have reported to the Health Department but didn\'t.  I had to use the Mens Room shortly before I left the restaurant.  While there one of the kitchen staff a man in his  50s or 60s with a kitchen cap on his head was using the urinal.  When he finished he turned the cold water on in the sink while walking quickly past the sink let a few drops of water hit a couple of fingers on one hand and took off back to the kitchen.  There was no soap used and the amount of time he "washed" his one hand was less than five seconds.  He didn\'t even dry his hands.  That was it for me.  I told my wife who was eating with me I won\'t be returning for a very long time.  It\'s really a shame this was once a great place to go.  You could count on the food being good (admittedly the food seems to be better at lunchtime when there are a lot of people eating on their lunch break from work) at dinner.  There is a new buffet in town that opened last year Spring Buffet down the road closer to Downtown Ithaca.  Frankly I don\'t find the food at the new buffet to be better than the older buffet(when it\'s been good there) but it is always plentiful and the place is clean. Spring Buffet has been very successful and I\'m sure they have taken away business from this old buffet.  This old Chinese Buffet (known as Main Moon)  has lowered their prices to compete but unfortunately they have lowered their standards as well.  I won\'t be going back there soon if at all.\n' u'This place is great for the price. This review is only for their lunch menu:\n\nIf you like chicken this place is pretty good in that most of its meat dishes are chicken- coconut chicken sesame chicken emperor chicken bbq chicken honey chicken sweet and sour chicken braised chicken...\nOtherwise the other meat is mainly pork. Not that much variety of meat.\nFor me being a chicken fan it was great. However my friend did not like it.\n\nThe sushi here however is pretty low end. If you want sushi this is probably not the place you should come; even though it is a buffet believe me it isn\'t worth it. \n\nAs for american fare they have like a pie of small pizza (looked like the one you get frozen) potato wedges and mash potatoes (that\'s all i remember).  If it\'s for american food this place probably isn\'t a good choice.\n\nSoup.. they had wonton soup hot and spicy soup and egg drop. I only get the egg drop and add green onions in it. Its sweet and tastes like sweet chicken soup.\n\nIf you want dessert... this is one of the worst place to get some. Either canned fruits fresh fruits about to go bad jello or dry cake. Maybe the soft serve ice cream is good but I can\'t judge because I did not try it.\n\nThere\'s also fried rice lo mein and rice noodles. I only get the rice noodles when I come. It\'s pretty good.\n\nAs for vegetable selections aside from spring rolls there\'s some stir fried broccoli and zucchini with pork stir fried broccoli with zucchini mushrooms fried tofu and baby corn (vegetarian option i suppose) and some crunchy sauteed string beans.\n\nI came here twice (two Saturdays) and the food options are pretty much the same Compared to the first time the second time had a few more sushi roll options and a chicken option.  \n\nIn addition their takeout menu (which also advertises it\'s buffet) it says that they "use 100% vegetable oil" so that we don\'t have to "worry about counting calories when eating chinese food". They definitely have no clue what they are talking about. Their stuff are pretty oily.. and if you are looking to eat healthy this is probably not the place.\n\nThe thing I don\'t like most about this place is the service. Aside from seating you and asking you want you want to drink there is basically no service. Well.. I guess that is expected of a buffet place... They do come pick up your plates once in a while. First time I went they took my fork! (so I could not eat anymore.. but I was about done so i didn\'t complain). In addition what i DO NOT LIKE is that they give you the receipt when you are still eating! Both times I went they did this. I did not even stay there long.. Also they also take about you to their co-workers not only behind your back but also in front of you. I am Chinese but i do not speak their language (mandarin) but I can understand it so it was disturbing to listen to the things they had to say first about the person before me and after me! RUDE! \n\nSo all in all if you don\'t mind having bad service cheap food which is not sushi desserts or anything not Chinese and a chicken fan this is a great place to go. Otherwise choose something else...\n' u"An Americanized version of Chinese cuisine it's comfort food. In that respect it does the trick. Good for families with children and those who don't have exotic tastes. I was disappointed by the little things: wasabi from a squirt bottle have to request chopsticks and lack of spicy food options.\n" u'Bugs in my soup and the manager verified it and agreed. She removed the pot of soup and we still had to pay after just eating a bowl of buggy soup. I will never come back. Before this incident I was a loyal customer as I had many memories with my family eating here. Never again!\n' u"It was probably one of the worst buffets I've ever been to. The food was cold and lacked flavor .The service was terrible they did not even bring drinks or straws for 15 minutes. All in all not worth the trip!\n" u'I dont think i can even give this place one star i walk in and the cookies are stale. The chicken wings are greasy the price is crazy. And to top it off there was a cockroach climbing around on the wall in there. Lost quite a few customers. What a nasty place!!!\n' u"Well where to begin? I am from the West Coast and love to travel & eat out  so I've had experienced my fair share of Chinese buffets. This one is probably one of the worst ones that I have ever been to. The food is very subpar. Very few varieties of meats - if one can even call it that. The sushi was gone when I went in and they did not replenish it quickly. When they did come out it was obviously made very fast lacking in quality. Even the rice was gross - and how the heck do you mess up making rice in a rice cooker?! At one point they ran out of bowls so I could not even get some soup / ice cream.  The only reason(s) I gave this restaurant two stars is because it is practically in the middle of nowhere in upstate NY and their spicy mayo sauce was actually quite delicious. I put some in my rice in order to make it at least somewhat edible.\n" u"The food here is very average but there's a lot of food so you get a lot of bang for your buck. Their dessert section is a bit lackluster they have a softserve machine select Hershey's ice cream flavors stale cookies and cut fruit. Everything served here is Chinese-American food not authentic Chinese. The servers here are really nice.\n" u'Why even bother five stars... Terrible service sad looking food on the buffet trays... They could have done much better.\n' u"The name of this restaurant is actually Main Moon and it is hands down the best Chinese food experience in Ithaca.\n\nAlright I may be exaggerating a bit but the folks at Main Moon came to know me very well. The buffet is cheap - two can eat for $20 flat including hot tea and it offers a variety of soups appetizers entrees and desserts. I love their sweet and sour chicken - a staple in all Chinese restaurants but their style stands out among the rest. \n\nThe servers don't speak the best English but they are all kind and welcoming and very attentive. If anything is ever low on the buffet just let your server know and they'll have it freshly filled in a matter of minutes.\n"]
22.Sunset Grill,[u'Waiter was friendly and attentive.  Dinner was everything we expected.  Basic American fare but hot and tasty.  Money paid well worth what we had to eat.\n' u"We really love this place for an early Sunday breakfast. I've never been in when it starts getting crowded (seemingly around 9-10am) but it's quite peaceful and friendly on the early side. The staff are always super nice the service is top notch (fast refills efficient ordering and arrival of food fast payment) and everything we've ordered has been excellent. They tend to have awesome specials on weekends like eggs benedict and biscuits and gravy. Check it out!\n" u"Kind of pricey but love the food and the view.\nDon't forget to get a jar of coffee for your table - the best coffee I've ever had in Ithaca!\n" u"Great service. We were treated when we walked in seated on the deck that has a view of Lake Cayuga and got our coffee and omelette scary fast. We both had the bacon and mushroom omelette which comes wrapped in the bacon. If every omelette with bacon came that way the breakfast world would be a better place. The coffee was a little weak but typical for a diner. \nI can imagine this view as sunset wince we were on this side of the lake last night and it was lovely. They bring in a good crowd. Since the colleges were out getting in at 915 wasn't a big deal. Next week it'll be a different story.\n" u'Good food served quickly. I only had the breakfast items and it was all good. \n\nFriendly and efficient service. \nReasonable prices. \nGreat views. \n\nIf I lived in the area I would definitely be a regular.\n' u'Best French toast! But if you want something heavy dipped in egg batter you may not like it.\nCinnamon roll excellent! Very sweet though\n' u"Quick easy breakfast spot that's decently priced with large portions. I had the omelette that came with toast and it tasted good. Nothing out of the ordinary or exceeded expectations but it's a good place.\n" u"Second time here for breakfast. My husband and I love this place. Great view of Cornell and Cayuga Lake. Staff is friendly kitchen has enough cooks that food comes out fast hot and tasty. We've never been here for lunch or dinner but we will be back.\n" u'Really delicious brunch food for a decent price! All the omelets were under $10. My friends and I got a corner seat next to the patio so we got a beautiful view of the lake and Cornell. I did the make my own omelet and the food came out within 10 minutes. I will definitely come back again! One of the best brunch places in Ithaca.\n' u"Easily the best waitstaff in Ithaca.  All servers I've had are attentive and kind.  Great option for breakfast and overlooks the lake.  Despite being on a busy road and the entry looking a bit suspect the atmosphere is really great  - a cross between a solid country restaurant and a diner.\n" u"Don't let the fact that the Grill shares a parking lot with a gas station and a liquor store cause you to go elsewhere.  Went on Sunday afternoon for a late breakfast.  It was still a 20 minute wait.  Food was excellent.  My son loved the bacon waffles and said the cinnamon role was fantastic.  I had the corned beef hash and I have to say that I have had better.  But the eggs were perfect and the blueberry pancake was really good.  In the warmer months the view from the porch must be awesome.\n" u'Average diner/family restaurant. Wide selection. Bottled beer $4.75 each for a Bud Light is steep. The view from the porch is gorgeous. Service is slow. The biggest and most confusing part is the pricing on eggs? $9+ for a 2-egg omelet (which is weird onto itself since it is typically 3+) but I digress... $5 for 3 eggs in any style. So I am paying $4 for my cheese and mushrooms? Take a look and maybe I am not getting it...\n' u"Here's the thing. I love sunset grill. This was my go to throughout all of college. I went there every other weekend and they have great diner food. BUT I have had two terrible experiences which have completely ruined my good times there. Yesterday I went with a group of 6 people. It is the day after slope day at Cornell so we knew it would be busy. We were told it would be a 25 minute wait. We waited over an hour to be seated. When we were finally seated we were ignored for 15 minutes before a server came over to us. We were so frustrated that we just left. I really hope that the wait staff can pull things together so I can go back and enjoy it again.\n" u"Super long wait on Sunday morning. Even after being seated nobody came to take our order for a long time. It's been 45 minutes since we arrived and we are still waiting for our food. I hope it comes soon!\n" u'Subpar diner food.  The food comes out extremely fast.  Fantastic view of Lake Cayuga and Ithaca.  Pancakes tasted like an Aunt Jemima mix.  Omelette was tasty and very standard.  Breakfast potatoes were not good at all.\n' u'Loved this place!  Went there two mornings in a row for breakfast.  The portions are large service is good and friendly.  This is a hometown diner.  No grease! The homefries were potatoie and delicious.  Western omelet was fabulous.  Pancakes were huge!  Wish they had real maple syrup! I will go back again and again.  The diner is right near Ithaca College on South hill.\n' u'Waited a bit to get served but once we ordered our food came quickly.  We all ordered egg dishes which were all delicious.  Defiantly recommend for breakfast.\n' u"This is a great find during our visit to Ithaca.  It is on a hill so you can see Lake Cayuga in the distance when you sit on the deck.  The food was very good.  I especially loved the Duck Wings with the Asian Sauce.  It is more meaty and flavorful than chicken wings and I loved the  crispy skin.  The portions are huge!  For our family of 2 adults & 2 kids - 10 & 8 year olds we probably could have ordered 3 entrees instead of 4.  My steak tacos were filled with rare steak and a cilantro vinaigrette slaw.  My husband's Gyro was more like a gyro salad with lots of lettuce and feta cheese.  Even the side salad is more like the typical full-size salad at other restaurants.\n\nNote this restaurant only serves breakfast and lunch.  That's a shame since you can catch a beautiful sunset on Lake Cayuga from the deck.\n" u"Great ffod. Friendly service. A bit tricky to find - it's behind the Sunoco gas station ip on the hill. Bacon blue cheese burger was great. My friend loved the meat loaf.\n" u"Situated by Ithaca College this place has an awesome view looking out over all of Ithaca. I would say it is more like a diner than a grill though. They make decent omelets cinnamon buns waffles pancakes etc. Nothing is great but nothing is bad either. They also have standard dinner fair such as salads entrees and various fried foods.\n\nIf it weren't for the view I would probably not come back but its a cozy place to hang out with friends over a no frills weekend brunch.\n"]
182.McDonald‚Äôs,[u"Opened during the first snowstorm of 2014 with no delays! McDonald's is one of the most consistent franchise chains there are.  This particular McD's was very much like most every other McD's you've gone to.  The staff here were friendly and engaged which give it a plus.  The food was exactly as ordered and expected.\n\nIf you want McD's don't shy away from this location!\n" u'Absolutely terrible experience. I driving by like shit I could go for some Mcd\'s right quick.  Turns into a 20 minute ordeal.  Some fat bitch in the car behind me screams to move my "fucking truck"\n' u'I went there 5 times during June 1 - 12 and it was awesome. I stopped being there customer for couple years because at drive through I ordered one thing and got other thing different from what I ordered with bad service I complained them and they didnt care.. But I tried at this location again and not see those people this year it was way much better than other fast food and I can say it was better than some fine dining restaurant in town too. Great food great service nice people great atmosphere and I would recommended this place for everyone.\n' u"I have no idea why these guys are giving 5 an 4 stars but this place is the worst! I travel a lot and frequent plenty of McDonald's and this place is by far the slowest. I've been to places that boast their 20 second serve time and they aren't kidding! This place your lucky to get your food in under 15 minutes with only a small handful of people. You'll save time driving to the one in downtown Ithaca this one isn't worth your time.\n" u"This is a regular McDonalds but I've never experienced such slow fast food except for once in a Baltimore McDonalds. The food is fine but really quite slow. It took them almost 10 minutes just to get my yogurt and that was all I ordered! You'd do better speed-wise going by the drive-through then eating in.\n"]
118.Trillium,[u"This is my favorite place to eat on Cornell's campus. They have a great variety of food and are pretty fast unless the lines are out the door. \n\nI love getting quesadillas Chinese food or the Asian noodle bowls. The noodle bowls are now the cheapest thing on the menu and are really filling. This year they started offering veggies as an option which is actually really good. $4.85 for the veggie noodle bowl. \n\nThe one annoying part is that the quality of food can change quite a bit depending on who makes it. Consistency across the board is lacking. What changes the most is the portion size depending on whoever makes it. \n\nOverall is is the most convenience location for the Ag quad and it has some great options.\n" u'Honestly the only reason I go here is because it\'s within quick walking distance. Especially if Manndible Cafe (which is the eatery closest to my office) is crowded (or they don\'t have much in the cooler) I\'ll walk down to Trillium and grab something. \n\nTrillium is never going to be a location where I really enjoy going though. The food is generally more expensive than it should be the food from the Chinese food bar is overly salty their burgers are mediocre at best and just... blah. \n\nIf anything I\'ve just decided it\'s easier if/when I get to Trillium to just grab a pizza or some soup or even something from the cooler section and then get to a cashier ASAP. This place can get really crowded and I rarely end up eating at one of the tables because they\'re usually pretty gross (people leave trash in/around tables don\'t wipe up spills etc.). \n\nI know it\'s a campus location so I try to generally lower my expectations. I\'ll meet people here for lunch from time to time (it\'s convenient when meeting with friends or colleagues who may work down campus) but it\'s rare.\n\nTL;DR  Not my first choice. Generally just consider this place to be pretty "blah."\n' u"Trillium has the best variety out of all the cash eateries on campus. The salads are huge here. If you just want a normal salad you get more for your money at this location than the ivy room. However the choice of ingredients is far better/fancier at the Ivy room. \n\nYou will probably enjoy the heating bin chinese food station if you prefer deep fried chicken in generic gloppy sweet sauce (orenge sesame general tso). I you prefer chinese food that doesn't fit that description you should probably stay away. \n\nThe noodle bowl station might just be one of the best values on campus; these bowls consist of noodles (wheat or rice) choice of beef chicken or tofu and comes with scallion cilantro and a soy sauce based broth. The tofu bowl is $3.99 and a meal in itself!\n\nThere is a station that gets you a drink hot entree and two sides for 6.99 and this food can vary depending on the day of the week. I absolutely loved the Mediterranean theme one week but was disappointed to see it go away. I find the indian food and the pulled pork options sub-standard at this station. Other stations include your standard wraps burgers fries etc. and in my opinion all of these stations are just OK.\n" u'Their salad burrito and pasta are fine. Avoid Chinese food. They are salty and taste like plastic. I also find their burger to be mediocre. Line is very long during rush hours.\n' u'Best on campus dining location. Morning yogurt bar is a great healthy option. For lunch salad bar remains a quintessential favorite but the new advent of pasta by design is similarly noteworthy. Prices are high and will eat BRBs like none other but worth it!\n' u'Another one of my favorite lunch spots during college! Get the chicken fajita quesadillas. So spicy and good!!\n' u'Overpriced food Chinese food is hella greasy unless you get dibs on the first batch of whatever is cooked at least then it is edible and has not been marinating in itself forever.\n\nGood variety but place is way too packed. Turkey club is good so are the quesadillas. Water was sometimes charged for getting the cups...which is ridiculous but whatever. Overall decent food too high of prices.\n' u"Pretty good food but not great and it's usually pretty crowded. I like their make-your-own breakfast parfaits and the omelettes look good. Not a fan of their chicken tenders...for that you'd be much better off going to the Terrace in the Statler Hotel--Mac's is also good for sandwiches.The Statler is soo much better and the Terrace's fries and salads are also way way better. The Chinese in Trillium is kind of greasy but I don't mind it. I used to like the Mexican pizza but I think they stopped making that. Trillium's better for breakfast I think which ends too early for me. I don't really like the wraps and I've heard bad reviews from friends of the Meditaranian? section. There's this noodle dish you can get in the Asian corner but it's only ok and it makes me feel kind of sick after awhile.\n\nIt's easy to spend a lot here in BRBs (Big Red Bucks) and a lot of students end up adding more BRBs later in the semester so I'd recommend saving the money to eat on campus if you have a meal plan or just going to the Statler or even the Ivy Room in Willard Straight if you're too hungry to wait. Definitely much better food there but still just as crowded in between classes.\n" u"I actually didn't really like much of the food here besides the salad bar and breakfast.  Everything else was average or forgettable.  The location was perfect for me though as I am in the Ag school.  The grill was also decent.  The Mexican and Asian corners were just not up to par at all.  Also it always gets really crowded so you end up sharing a table with other people or having to wait really long to find seating.\n" u"Best curly fries ever.  I would've trekked over here even if I wasn't an aggie!\n" u"the most convenient dining hall for ag kids trillium. but even if it weren't for the convenience factor i'd still find my way there for their single winner of a lunch plate the seafood platter. fried fish and shrimp and clam strips with tartar sauce. this was my introduction into the scrumptious world of fried clam strips. and i've been on the hunt for more crispy meaty clam strips since leaving campus.\n"]
91.Solaz,[u"I have to admit that these are the best breakfast burritos I have had in Ithaca. I moved here a year ago from Southern California where I tested numerous breakfast burritos. Honestly Solaz's burritos are even better than the ones I had in socal. It's usually tough for me to get anything done on my weekend mornings but I will drag myself out of bed to get one of their burritos. \n\nWhy is it so good?\nWell I tend to love when the ingredients in a breakfast burrito are so mixed up that every bite has each delicious ingredient. It is a true pet peeve of mine when I bite in and get a mouthful of potato. Solaz's breakfast burrito doesn't do that. It is so well mixed up that every last bite is a perfect blend of flavors.\n" u"This place makes breakfast burritos with your choice of fixings. People go crazy over this food stand and the lines are incredibly long but I don't really understand what the big deal is. Coming from LA where the breakfast burritos are fantastic and having experienced Austin TX's famous breakfast tacos I can't say this place fills my need for Mexican inspired breakfast options. The breakfast burritos at Mexeo's are far better. There are other fantastic food choices at the Ithaca Farmers Market; Don't waste your time here.\n" u'The breakfast burritos at this place are superb! While the prices for a burrito might be steep they are worth it. Once you get over the Cambodian food at the Farmer\'s market (and some people never do) you will find that these burritos especially the "special" hit just the right spots. The salsa is delicious and comes in a variety of heat levels the tortillas are also solid and he must something very creamy in his eggs because they are fluffy and moist.\n']
115.Jack‚Äôs Grill,[u"Jacks is awesome!!!!\nThe garbage sauce on the wings is fabulous.\nMight just be the best cooked burger I've ever had besides my own of course.\n" u"The service is absolutely horrible. Cashier person didn't show up for about the first 20 minutes. We ordered online about 30 min ahead of time and we still had to wait another 30 min at  the restaurant. Server wouldn't tell us when order would be ready. Save your time and order somewhere else\n" u'I ordered delivery and there was a mistake with the first order the manger was very nice about it and promptly sent a new order out that came perfect the wings are always delicious defiantly the best chicken in town\n' u"The food is fresh and delicious but this may be the slowest restaurant in the world. Ordered online multiple times arrived when they told me to and I still wind up waiting for more than 15 minutes. That's unacceptable especially for grilled food that should be quick to prepare.\n" u"Although Jack's has improved greatly in the quality and the pricing of their food in the past year it now takes 30-60 minutes for food to to be made and orders usually do not come with the correct toppings. Ordering online is a gamble as Jack's has removed the estimated time when the order is ready as they don't even know when it will be done. If I order a burger or sandwich toppings are usually not added. This is especially infuriating when adding premium toppings which cost $1.00 each. Eating at the location is also not so great as orders are backed up even when the place isn't packed and staff argue loudly sometimes over orders. This review is sad because I genuinely like the food at Jack's but everything negative about the place is really holding it back.\n" u'Strong menu plenty of choices. Worth a visit. A bit on the pricey side for lunch and a 20 minute wait for a burger seems a bit long.\n' u"4 of us ordered lunch from then yesterday and it was a disaster. \n\nThe food arrived roughly when GrubHub said it would but that was the only highlight. \n\nAll of our fries were soggy as if they had been sitting for some time before getting to us. Most notably our 2 cheese dog combo arrived sans cheese. \n\nI mean just wow. \n\nWhen I called the person taking calls apologized and said he'd send the cheese up right away with some new fries. \n\nWell almost an hour later we received some more soggy fries and a cup of cheese. \n\nNeedless to say if I could leave a zero star review I would.\n" u'Love this place. The food is great quality and if you are a student such good comfort food! The portions I think are spot on. I love the milkshakes. They have options for burgers for vegetarians and the black bean option is delicious. The fries are good and the shakes are yummy. Only downside is the price as it is pricey.\n' u"Jacks Grill has just recently redone the menu (and the space) AND ITS AMAZING!\n\nI came in recently because I heard it was all redone and I was *so* happy with my food! It was easy to order came out fast and hot and just tasted delicious!\n\nI highly suggest the cornbread deep fried pickles (that wasabi dip tho) and especially the waffle iron cheese - it's incredible! Top it all off with a red velvet milkshake and you'll be set for the night!\n" u'Decided to try something new what a find. Very unassuming from the street but the food is awesome. The mac and cheese is to die for just come hungry the portions are big. The burgers are out of this world. Let me recommend the Pacman burger.\n' u"Jack's used to be pretty good. Used to come here a lot for the weekday deals. Felt obligated to write a review now because of all these awful changes they've made. \n\nOverall everything is more expensive (nearly 4 dollars for a side order of plain fries?) All the original weekday deals are terrible now as its priced at $10 by including fries/drink or a milkshake which doesn't feel like a deal at all.  Their interesting and creative burgers + chicken sandwiches are no longer on menu and instead Jack's has opted for overpriced common ones with the option to add your own toppings at high surcharges.\n" u'Very good quality food which is reflected in the price. You get what you pay for which in this case are very good burgers chicken shakes cheesesteaks. We have been very happy so far. We have done delivery and the service has been good with considerate drivers though on Fridays delivery can take a while which I expect is due to volume. Definitely becoming one of our go to places here. \n\nUpdate: I have stood up for this place before but is am done with them now. They keep getting the orders wrong. I Called a few days ago to let them know about the problem. They sort of hemmed and hawed and blamed it on the delivery service. Happened again today. Called the restaurant and spoke to a manager named Steve. Told him the order was wrong again asked for the charge to be reversed and said it needed to be addressed or we wouldn\'t be ordering again. He said and I quote: "Well don\'t then. See ya" and hung up. \n\nDon\'t care how good your food is: if ok can\'t get the order right and your staff are jerks you don\'t deserve to be in business.\n\nUpdate: The manager called back to apologize which I appreciate.\n' u'I could fucking raise a chicken cut it up into little pieces and fry it before these fuckers give me my wings\n' u"I went to Jack's Grill for an early dinner and ordered cheeseburger with regular fries and drinks. It took about 4-5 minutes for my meal to come. Very freshly-made burger and fries although the patty was quiet thin. 3 stars because I expect more from the $10.XX I spent.\n" u"Sigh Jacks wednesday half priced burgers was one of my favorite deals at Collegetown (especially since you really cant get a burger anywhere closer) but now they don't have the deal and many of their burgers are gone (you can order the toppings of previous menu items like the Drunken Cowboy but they're all extra which makes an already overpriced burger even more expensive). I wish they would bring back their menu but for now their prices and lack of options don't motivate me to go again.\n" u"The food here is solid! Good burgers great chicken sandwiches and crispy well seasoned fries. The only downside is that they are a bit pricey compared to your typical burger joint - expect to pay around 10-12 dollars for a sandwich and fries. But otherwise a decent restaurant that's great for a quick meal.\n" u'I\'d have a better impression of this place if it weren\'t so overpriced. The patty\'s are tiny 1/4 lb patties (think McDonalds patty size) and are definitely not worth $7.69 (price of most of their burgers unless you want a plain burger). That\'s not even including fries.  $3.99 for a side of fries which aren\'t bad but they give you such a small portion and definitely aren\'t $4 good. $1.50 for a drink. $7.69 + $3.50 + $2.50 = $13.50. The owner claims this is a result of it being of higher quality burger than a fast food burger. Okay. The buns a little better. But $6 better? Nah. Think the patty is too thin? "Then get a double" says the owner...yes we get it. We pay more money we\'ll get more food. The point is that $7.69 for a 1/4 lb patty just isn\'t reasonable. Want sauce? Pay $1.00 and get a portion cup of ranch.\n\nMy guess is that extra money is to pay for the new bar they added and the rent that comes with that. I mean I get it it\'s Collegetown.\n\nOther people bitched about the service. I never have had a problem with it. Delivery has always been reasonable.\n\ntl;dr: foods fine but not worth the price. fine service in my experience.\n' u"Jack's Grill has TERRIBLE customer service. Waited two hours for my delivery meal and called four-five times. I was met by a very rude waitress over the phone that gave me attitude and hung up the phone on me when the restaurant was the one who took a very long time to make the food and get the right contact info down to notify me. When the food finally came it was cold and hard. Never will order from Jack's again.\n" u"No bang for your buck. The food is good nothing spectacular but you aren't getting what you pay for. The cheesesteak is $8 and not a substantial amount of food...and adding fries is an additional cost. It doesn't fill you up and certainly is not what you think you're paying for. The food is average in taste but quite overpriced. Not worth the $$$\n" u"I gave this place a few more tries and it earns an additional star on top of what I gave it before.\n\nI tried their loaded fries which is a plateful of fries with bacon cheese and sour cream. It's sufficient as its own meal if you're eating it by yourself. I've ordered it several times and it hasn't come out bad at all.\n\nAlso on Thursdays they do ten chicken wings for $5 in the bar which is a crazy good deal. It was always a pretty good choice for an early meal last semester since the bar would open around the time I left campus and you could just sit and watch some early football or basketball games.\n\nThe wait for your food is still outrageously slow. Cash only for under $10 is quite a nuisance when most of your orders are gonna be for under $10.\n"]
40.Bandwagon Brew Pub,[u"My new favorite place to hit up in downtown Ithaca!\n\nWe ordered an Orange Julius and a Pirate IPA. The julius in particular was outstanding.  Light easy and well-mixed with an orange peel on top. \n\nInside there's a bar and a variety of tables to choose from in two separate rooms.  It doesn't get too loud in here so it's an ideal place to meet friends for drinks at. Conversation is easy here as it's a very relaxed waiting staff and atmosphere.  I felt no pressure or anxiety asking about drink contents here.  My bartender was very informative when I asked for a recommendation.  After asking what I valued in a beer he matched me with their only IPA (February 2017) a hoppy bold robust Pirate.  I'll order it again and highly recommend it. \n\nYou could read a book here or even get some homework done during the day.  It feels almost like a cafe or coffeeshop though obviously there are excellent beers to try on tap.  A quaint atmosphere with an ambience of local friendly warm conversation.  Also- a great place to talk with strangers.\n" u'Was in Ithaca on business and decided to have dinner with a coworker at Bandwagon. It was wing night but strangely empty. Wings were OK. My friend ordered Mac And Cheese and it came out covered in fries ! She found only a small lump of the mac and cheese at the bottom of the bowl of fries. Not great. The in house brewed beers were fine. The space has potential. Maybe we were just there on an off night.\n' u'A pleasant surprise! We looked for a brew pub for some local beer and a nice meal before a Cornell hockey game and we definitely found it. A nice selection of beer on tap including their own and other local favorites. And the food was excellent! Locally sourced when possible.  We shared the local cheese plate with the house-made tomato relish as an appetizer - an explosion of flavors together with some nice fresh bread.  My husband had a burger and I had a half portion of the Pork & Pomme pasta.  Sausage cream sauce sweetened with cider apples and tortellini. A really nice sweet and savory combination - after my husband demolished his burger  he helped me finish because it was SO good.  Service was fast and pleasant too. Definitely recommended!\n' u"This was a nice little gem we came across while spending the night in Ithaca. Just follow the stairs down and you'll enter a little space with some big food and brew.\n\nThe food here is extremely fresh! They use local farms for their meat an veggies! The French fries are made from potatoes in Interlaken NY and ohhhhhh my gosh - SO good!\n\nI had the Chipotle Chicken sandwich which was delicious. the chicken was juicy tender and blackened cheddar cheese chipotle aioli and some free lettuce tomato and onion. It was very flavorful. I chose Mac Salad for my side and it was different because it didn't just taste like it was mixed with mayo - very herby and light which was awesome!\n\nGet their Bandwagon Flight - lots of variety on the taste of the beers. It's $12 and you'll be feeling nice after you finish! \n\nService was fast and friendly - can't go wrong!\n" u'Elegant atmosphere for first dates and getting to know people. The dim lighting and color palettes make me nostalgic for Manhattan... Great beer and interesting fries.\n' u"Asked the bartender for a drink and he said that he's got it. He walks over to someone he must know (a customer) and stands with him making him a couple drinks. 20 minutes pass and I still don't have my drink. I ask again for the drink he continues to talk to his friend. I ask what I assume to the owner for the check and he asked how it went. I told him I asked that bartender twice for the same drink. He had a talk with the bartender and he offers to make up for the never served drink with a couple free shots. I say yes. He walks away and never returns with said drink... \n\nUnless you don't want to be served alcohol at a bar after asking many times avoid this place.\n" u'Great food great beer list. Get the waffle! Chipotle chicken sandwich was also excellent.\n' u"At first I seen the sign out front but wondered where's the bar!? Well look down the steps and you'll find it in the cellar. \n\nI liked the art work on the walls as well as the adjacent lounge bandwagon has. This is beyond a doubt a laid back place to order a drink or brew and just kick back and relax. The beer selection is good here and I did try the udder milk stout which was creamy with a touch of cocoa tastes as milk stouts should be. \n\nWe did order some loaded fries and they do claim there the best in town and they where crispy and fantastic I did enjoy those! I also heard the burgers here are fantastic and the next time I'm definitely going to have to try one of these out for sure as well as trying a selected flight of brews!\n" u'My afternoon snack was absolutely phenomenal! Me being a traveler was looking for that "moms\' homemade cooking" and this was definitely the place. I order The Other Breakfast Sandwich" with a side of bacon and their hash brown casserole. I must say I have no complaints. Also their bloody marrys are on point (taste like they make their own mix from scratch).\n' u"went in on a saturday at 2pm. walked in and greeted by a bewildered and clueless millennial. when asked if she was closed she responded i don't know. when asked who would know she was further confused. it turns out the place is closed for what looked like filming( who films on a saturday afternoon).\n" u"Visiting the University we were recommended by students to eat here late on a Sat night.\n\nGood hamburgers good beer good atmosphere kind of help yourself place--they will bring the food out to you after you order and pay.   It's downtown where all the stores and shops and bars are.   \n\nIt's not a cheap place to dine--beer and burger will run you approx. 15 a head but I think most people will be satisfied with the quality.\n" u'We have been here a few times but not recently. Had dinner here the other night. Nice cozy place underground. They have expanded since we were last here. Now there is a lounge area. Brew their own beer as well as have a nice selection of other local brews and ciders. Good quality bar selections. \n\nFor food I had the Big Kahuna Burger. Burger with local ham and a slice of pineapple. It was quite tasty. May have been better if I knife and forked it as the sandwich failed to maintain its structural integrity about halfway through between pineapple juice mustard and beef juices.  This did not diminish the taste though. \n\nMy wife had fish and chips. There were enough fries for both of us and my wife said both were quite good. \n\nThe best thing we had though was a brussel sprout appetizer/family style side. This was amazing. I could have just eaten this and big perfectly content.\n' u'We love the ambiance here. The food is great and the beer and wine flights are significant. Fair prices.\n' u'Update- November 2015. Changed from 5 to 4 stars. Brought out of town friends. Everyone ordered a burger but me and everyone agreed: "Meh"- nothing special about the burgers. I got the Vegan Coconut curry (the only dairy-free option on the menu) and the spice totally over powered the other flavors. It was not labeled as "hot" or "spicy" but the dish was very unbalanced. I couldn\'t taste the sweetness of the coconut after the first bite and every bite tasted the same. I got the fried chicken on top and it was very mediocre and overcooked. Still a fine restaurant with good service and nice ambiance but there was nothing special about the food on this visit.\n' u'We picked this spot to celebrate a birthday. \n\nWe started with a beer flight and a 14 year aged scotch. They have lots of interesting craft brews. Good times. \n\nReached out to the server to ask about our appetizer. He assured us it should be coming out shortly and ran to the kitchen. He walked out holding our entrees instead. "The kitchen lost the ticket.." he claimed. This is usually code for "I forgot to put in your order."\n\nThe curry was a boring bland mush. Colorless and lacking flavor. The presentation was decent but there was almost no flavor. I wouldn\'t order it again.\n\nThe waffles entree is the standout dish here. It\'s a cornmeal waffle cooked crispy to hold up to the amazing sauce. Shrimp andouille sausage spinach onions and tomatoes in a red pepper-chili cream sauce. The flavors popped and the presentation was excellent. A real winner. \n\nThe steak course was a ribeye with combination butter garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. The mashed was boring but the steak had flavor. \n\nTo finish our meal we ordered the apple & pear crisp on the recommendation of the server. The fruit tasted fresh and wasn\'t overcooked as is common. The taste of cinnamon really came through but wasn\'t overpowering. Light and tasty. A nice end to the meal.\n' u'Mediocre service obviously untrained and uncaring. Food was ok chicken strips overcooked blue cheese funky flavor burger undercooked menu inaccurate. Beer was great. Stick with Beer skip the food.\n' u"Service was great very friendly and quick. Nice atmosphere. Drinks are good (not watered down or filled with ice) and not overpriced. The burger I ordered was literally one of the best burgers I've ever had. Has that nice charcoal fresh & smokey taste. They also don't skimp you out on the fries! Definitely worth trying.\n" u'Gotta say after last years chilifest I did not ever want to come here as this was the worst chili of the day for me but I am glad I stopped in!\n\nThis little hole in the floor pub is amazing. Walked in got seated immediately and ordered drinks. I got the ginger soda which was amazing. They brew it in house and it tastes better than any ginger ale I\'ve ever had. The ginger flavor is that of real ginger and it\'s not overpowering and the sweetness level of this is spot on! Definitely can\'t wait to come back and try this again!\n\nAnyways one of the specials was house made poutene with curds house made beef gravy and their fries.\n\nThis poutene was off the hook. The beef gravy was flavorful the fries salty crunchy and we had a large portion and the curds were great just wished there had been more.\n\nWe followed this up with their burger.\n\nThe burger here has pretty much become my favorite in Ithaca but it had one caveat. \n\nSo it seems that many restaurants love to use Ithaca Bakery for all their bread needs because Ithaca bakery. Just because we have this place doesn\'t mean it\'s the best and doesn\'t mean you should use it. Personally I think their bread is overrated and honestly people come on make your own rolls in house because you certainly can do better.\n\nThat\'s the caveat here. The roll. It was dry flavorless and just unappealing which upsets me because the beef patty here win\'s me over. The beef here is not just flavorful it\'s FLAVORFUL! You can tell they not only season the burger before hand but also when it\'s hit the grill. The patty is a great size and it was cooked perfectly to my liking. This beef patty I could\'ve just taken it off the darn roll and eaten it alone! The lettuce tomato and onion were definitely fresh and there was a great amount of them too which I loved. Everything about this burger was amazing if it just had a different roll!\n\nI know I keep harping on this but if you get down here and try this burger I know you\'ll say the same thing.\n\nThe bacon cheddar and dressing on the sandwich were amazing too! I had a thick piece of bacon on this thing and it was awesome. I definitely tasted this as part of the burger. The cheese was great too a nice thick cheese that didn\'t overpower but added it\'s flavor into the mix and the dressing was great. The Tarragon Russian dressing was great! Perfect lather for this burger!\n\nThe reason this place get\'s knocked a star isn\'t actually because of the roll (yes surprising I know) it\'s because of the price.\n\nThe plate of poutene cost us $9.....NINE DOLLARS!\n\nGranted I knew this when I ordered it but had there had been more cheese curds I probably wouldn\'t have complained. For fries gravy and curds the size of what they gave us it was a $6-$7 dish not $9.\n\nThe Burgers were $14. Now I understand you use fresh local meat and I understand this is not a chain and things are pricey but seriously? $14? Stop using Ithaca bakery make your own rolls and drop the darn price to $11-$12. Ithaca Bakery is overpriced anyways.\n\nNow okay your thinking "you\'re complaining about 1-2 dollars on both items" but seriously that add\'s up! For two guys that would\'ve made our $40 dinner $34. $34 is reasonable for two apps and two burgers but $40 makes me question whether or not I\'m going to return.\n\nI understand this review is long but it\'s only because I want to love this place so much and I hope they read this and take what I\'ve said into thought maybe.\n\nI\'ll definitely come back as it was still a great experience but I\'ll choose the ale house over this for my go to burger place even though they make a killer patty here.\n' u'A gem of a pub and eatery located in a garden level space with tremendous character.  The owners brew their own beer and if you have difficulty deciding you can either sample or have a flight of beer to really get the full experience!  Great customer service excellent food.\n' u"Love this place. When I was in college Bandwagon was me and my friends' favorite bar in town. \n\nWe always liked Bandwagon because it had a kind of low lit basement feel that made the place homey and warm a place where you could kind of just chill with friends. However because of the bar's layout and size it was also a great place to party a little bit! There's lounge chairs little nooks in the wall traditional dining tables etc. I've had mixed experiences with their beers but the staff is alway super friendly and they don't have a credit card minimum! Also their fries are legendary in Ithaca. \n\nIt's always a good time for me at Bandwagon.\n"]
127.Capital State Kitchen Incorporated,[u'I organize a group that has been going to Capital State Kitchen & it\'s former location Capital Corner once or twice/ month since 2004. For 57 reviews on our website it has received 4 of 5 stars average.\n\nThey are always able to accommodate our group whether we have 2 people or 25. Our average group size is 10 people. They are always prepared and set up for us. They leave water pitchers on table for us. They give us all separate checks & never mix up customers or our dishes. The Chinese Food is as good as any other typical Chinese Food. The Sushi is usually very creatively plated and exceptional in taste.  \n\nThe Staff has always been extremely polite even when some of our group have on a handful of occasions been a bit loud.  We have many discussions and staff is not the type to eavesdrop or put in their 2 cents.\n\nThe prices for the Chinese Food are very reasonable and they have very reasonable priced "Combos".\n\nIn all the years there was only one time ever where the food was sketchy.\n\nThe main reason we go is the place is usually quiet and good acoustics to hear each other chat.  Also because the staff is so helpful and pleasant.\n\nThey even allow those on a diet to order BROWN RICE and most dishes steamed with sauce on the side.\n\nVery important for whole grains and diets to find a place with Brown Rice option.\n\nI admit I got bored with the Chinese food 2x month and very glad they now have Japanse Options as well.\n\nBudget minded will find great choices on the Chinese Menu.\n' u"If you're looking for sushi with a side of verbal abuse they've got you covered. I just tried to eat here again and the delivery guy told me to go fuck myself because my house number is not visible enough and that's apparently rude. I don't know why I tried it again after that one time I got spoiled avocado in my sushi from here.\n" u'"All U Can Eat" sushi sounds questionable at best but this place always pleasantly surprises me with top-quality gourmet sushi and Japanese appetizers for one reasonable price.  Yes the cost of the lunch special has gone up over the years but I would vastly rather that than reduced quality food.  Come hungry!!  Never tried the Chinese side.\n' u"Best sushi in Ithaca. Sure it's not Nobu but this is also not New York City. The fish is fresh and the lunch specials in particular are extremely reasonably priced even compared to other restaurants in Ithaca. I will miss this place once I graduate!\n" u"To preface: I'm reviewing my delivery/food experience not the restaurant.\n\nThe driver came within an hour after my order had been placed via GrubHub. He was very pleasant and kind no problems with delivery. \nThe Godzilla roll was delicious. I've noticed over the years different variations of the the typical tempura/fried rolls. I loved the spicy fish inside. I don't recall what it was specifically but it was tasty. And the drizzle of sauce on top made it even better.\nThe Salmon Lovers roll (called something like that) was mediocre at best. The salmon's texture wasn't usual and was way too chewy. I kept biting parts I felt should've been cut out.\n\nFinal thoughts: great price great delivery service it won't be my go to sushi place but I'll definitely try again in the future to try out different rolls.\n" u'Overall a decent experience. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it was rather cold inside but they had a great variety for the all you can eat lunch special ($25). The service was not the best even though there was no one else to serve in the restaurant and our waitress was rather rude. DO NOT go there on a date great place for a meal with close friends. Food was decent overall worth the money.\n' u"Man oh man I was so excited by this place I starved myself all day so I could as much all-you-can-order sushi. Wow I was not disappointed whatsoever. At most sushi buffets the sushi is low quality and just kind of so gross you feel disgusting after a couple hours of gorging. However I felt great even after a good 3 hours of constant eating with my friends (don't worry we didn't eat for three hours straight the food took time to come out). I think I was just so impressed by the cleanliness and the relative high quality of the place in general.\n\nAt the same time you have to eat a ton of sushi to really get your money's worth (21 dollars for dinner + tax + tip = 26 dollars). I might check this place out later for lunch and see how it is seeing as how they have all you-can-order then too. But this place is a MUST GO. Especially in the desolate barren land of Ithaca where many students start to go crazy from missing food from back home.\n" u"Good food. AWFUL  service like really awful. This is my second time here the first time we walked out because we weren't being welcomed or served by anyone for about 10 minutes and the restaurant was not busy by any means. So after some thinking we thought we'd give this place another shot and again the service was a disgrace. There were literally no customers in the restaurant and after we placed our order the sushi chef didn't come out for about 15 minutes to start preparing our food. Customer service is not a priority to these people and this place is truly a disgrace. I would not touch this place with a 10 foot pole again. Not because of the food which was good but because of their awful upsetting horrible customer service. Do not come here. There are plenty more sushi places in Ithaca that are much better. I am truly sorry for anyone that has ever had an experience with this place.\n" u'I ordered delivery. The food was good but it was so late and cold. The tempura was soggy and cold. The teriyaki salmon was cold.  I called when they were 20 minutes late and I heard the manager yelling at the delivery guy then she told me it was on the way. :(\n' u"I just received delivery and while it was average speed I wonder if the fish would've been fresher if it were faster. \n\nI spit out portions of the boston roll. The salmon was very chewy and texture of the rice and fish were definitely off. The spicy tuna and salmon rolls were not at all spicy and I'm not sure how much fish was in the very small six pieces of each roll. The flavor tasted like there was really no fish in it at all with an almost rancid lemon taste. \n\nOverall poor. \n\nI hope I don't get sick.\n" u"The price increased to $25 for the all you can eat buffet with tax and tip that's over 30$. It no longer seems like such a good value especially because they only have one guy making the sushi (meaning its slow). So I will likely not come back too soon since the sushi isn't really any better than other restaurants.\n" u'Recommended to this restaurant by a friend from Cornell I decided to give this place a try with two of my close friends.  We went to this restaurant around 8:00 on Friday Dec 9 2011 and since we were all quite hungry decided to go for the $22.99 all you can eat option.\n\nIt took the waiter about 5 minutes before approaching us to ask for our beverage preference and then another 10 before taking our order.  After taking our order the three of us must have waited over 45 minutes and when the food finally came to us it was not worth the wait.  (I would like to point out that at this time the restaurant was not busy there was a table of two and a group of around 10 asides from the three of us at the restaurant).  \n\nWe ordered sashimi various rolls and for dessert ice cream.  The sashimi served to us were dry and clearly not fresh.  The rolls were likewise not appetizing but acceptable given the fact that there was only one sushi chef making the food for the entire restaurant (only one person during dinner on a Friday night?).  The ice cream we had for desert had the texture and taste of ice cream that had clearly been sitting in the bottom of the freezer for a few months (and while the menu claims to have green tea and strawberry and vanilla flavors after we ordered the server promptly told us that the only flavor available was vanilla).\n\nHowever what is most ridiculous was the event that pushed me over to signing up and writing my first Yelp review.  After the three of us paid and were walking out the door our server had the audacity to come up to us and claim we "forgot" the tip.  I don\'t know what industry standards are these days but I tip when I receive good service not because of the fact that someone is operating a business in the states.\n\nBy the time we left it was past 10:00 we were not satisfied and I will definitely not be returning to this restaurant.\n' u"Went in for take-out sushi on a whim asked the hostess for her favorite roll.  She suggested the American Dream roll which turned out to be good but not really anything special.  Also got one of the special rolls that sounded a little crazy whose name I can't remember and it was quite tasty.\n\nThe decor is nicely done.  Capital is probably in my top 2 for sushi in Ithaca (Samurai being my other choice).\n" u'I had sushi buffet here for two times for lunch and one time for dinner. The quality of the sushi is better at lunch although the price is lower. My dinner experience at this place was awful. We were the only customers there and had to finish the sushi rolls we ordered which were definitely not fresh!\n' u"The sushi was very fresh and well priced. The special rolls while tasty were definitely smaller pieces than the lunch special pieces. But $12 lunch special for 3 rolls and a soup is great! I would definitely recommend the new york roll and the sweetheart roll and not opt for the American roll again. Delivery did also take an hour but I think that's fairly common around here.\n" u'Decent sushi at a good price. It is nothing special (like sushi in a real city). The all you can eat is a good deal if you want a lot of sushi. $25 for as many rolls and pieces you can stomach. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed.\n' u"I would give unlimited sushi lunch four stars because it's a good value if you're going to eat a lot. Three stars for dinner because $25 is a lot for this place. Be prepared for slow not particularly friendly service. I've had my order messed up a few times too. But I still keep going back every now and then when I just want to eat a lot of sushi. Don't come with a big group or around noon or any busy time because you'll spend a frustrating amount of time waiting for your food.\n" u"Honestly best sushi in town. And best chinese food too! I've eaten at all of the chinese/japanese restaurants here and this is the best. It's consistent.\n"]
55.Purity Ice Cream,[u'Love it love it love it !  \n\nTheir renovations of a couple of years ago made a fine local tradition even better. Wife and I often stop there when we come to Ithaca from our home in Cortland. We really enjoy the outdoor seating in good weather.\n\nLove it love it love it !\n' u'I am so done with Purity and it is all Breakfast\'s fault. Firstly it is horrendously loud in there. And this is coming from someone who regularly attends punk shows. It\'s so loud in side Purity that I nearly screamed. Perhaps waiting an hour for my food would have been less torturous if the noise level was tolerable. The space seems to be constructed in the worst possible way for noise.\nSecondly breakfast is so poorly organized and the service is so terrible that I\'ve never seen the wait for a table be less than 30 minutes. We waited 30 minutes to be "seated" then another 30 to receive our food. The entire time we were in the dining area there were 4-5 open tables with 10 or more people still waiting to be seated.  Why are so many people waiting so long when there are open tables?!\nThere\'s always a long wait but there is no good place to wait. No chairs. People were sitting on the floor. \nIt\'s not clear if there is table service. They have a weird system where you have to wait to be given a table number then order at the counter and sit at an assigned table. There are people milling about the dining area like they are wait staff but it\'s not clear to me whether they are wait staff. We were given small glasses of water by one person and never received refills. I saw 3 separate people get up and take water pictures off service trays so they could serve themselves. There was no indication that this was encouraged and later I saw a staff person filling some people\'s water glasses but we never received help. Is it supposed to work like Ithaca Bakery or Panera Bread where you order and take care of yourself? If so why are we all waiting so long to be "seated"?!\nThere used to be indoor seating for Ice Cream customers. They did away with that when they expanded to serving food. There is now only outdoor seating during meal times. So there are always confused ice cream eaters sitting in the assigned tables that you have to displace. \nBreakfast ends at 1PM on the weekends. I\'ve come in several times in the past year trying to eat. Every time some uninterested young staff person tells me that there\'s a really long wait and they probably won\'t get to me by the time breakfast is over because there\'s always a million people waiting.\nI don\'t get the impression that a single person working here has any restaurant experience. Or that the owners are interested in improving the dining experience. They easily could make more money if they could turn over tables more efficiently because so many people walk away due to the long waits. \nWhat\'s truly unfortunate is that the food was really fantastic tasting. I really enjoyed my pancake potatoes and egg. The coffee was very good. I was so hungry and angry by the time the food came that I could have screamed. No one would have heard me though because it\'s really that loud in there. I won\'t be returning ever. This was really one of the most unpleasant dining experiences I\'ve had.\n' u"First time here. Wanted to sample 2 flavors since I don't know what's good and couldn't decide. Lady working there was rude and unhelpful. I'm sorry if I wanted to sample the green tea...\n\nEnded up ordered 2 scoops on a waffle cone. Tasted like Dryers ice cream. Not impressed. Would not return.\n" u'Awful Bad Rude\nThey gave me  a hard time because I use the help of a service dog Never before I have been treated this way.\nMy dog is trained licensed clean very well behave.\n' u'I went in for a nice scoop of ice cream and boy did I get my craving satisfied! I love their ice cream especially their Mint flavored one. I forgot what the exact name was but it came out looking like chocolate but as you bite into it it became mint flavored! I love the environment here! Even if you are a local or a tourist this is a great place to take family and friends. There is a large seating area and the prices are cheap! Go with what you like and you will expect greatness!\n' u"Open late. Staff was patient with first-timers' questions. Great ice cream and excellent lemonade - super fresh not too sweet.\n" u"I was craving something sweet after dinner so my boyfriend and I went to Purity. What a disappointment! \n\n1) Terrible terrible service. The two employees saw us walk in and didn't greet us even though we were the only people in the store! I wanted to ask them questions about some of the flavors but the employees were walking around (re-filling containers of ice cream etc.) and didn't look up from what they were doing. No one asked if we needed help or wanted to taste any flavors. The employees didn't even make eye contact with us. Very unwelcoming and unapproachable. \n\n2) Good luck trying to get free samples! They have a bunch of flavors many of which I've never tried. But there's a tall plexiglass wall between the customers and employees that runs the entire length of the counter making it difficult for employees to pass you samples. You also don't interact with any employees until you reach the register and by that point there's other customers behind you and it's incredibly awkward holding up the line to try some samples. \n\n3) The ice cream isn't good. I got the salted caramel flavor and I could barely taste caramel. I even had my boyfriend try it and he confirmed that it tasted like plain ice cream. The ice cream wasn't smooth--I tasted ice crystals. Even worse they didn't mix the ice cream well so some bites of my ice cream were extremely salty and others didn't have any salt at all. \n\n4) They messed up people's orders! We were only in the store for 10 minutes and while we were near the register two different people came up to say that their ice cream was the wrong flavor or was missing toppings that they ordered. \n\nThis below-average ice cream was not worth the hassle.\n" u'Sweet and tasty ice cream with a lot of tastes. Definitely big in size even with the junior scoop. It gets pretty crowded at night even during the winter time. So be prepared for 5-10minutes wait for parking and the ice cream. Offers free tab water.\n' u"Superb ice cream no doubt.  Many classic flavors as well as some house combinations such as Sleepers Awake coffee ice cream base with chocolate fudge and chocolate chips.   I am told that at peak times there is a long wait which would be annoying; but we visited on a Wednesday evening in September so there was no line whatsoever.\n\nI do have to say that their format is irksome to a person who might like to sample a few flavors before settling on a single cone which approaches four dollars.  But if you're a local I imagine that you could solve that problem by trying many flavors over repeat visits.  If only...\n" u"All their ice creams are just bomb. The BOMBBERRY is BOMB. That's all I got. Thanks guys\n" u"When coming to Ithaca Cornell Dairy often steals the show but after having both I cast my vote for Purity. There are so many different flavor combinations here that it can be hard to choose especially when the line is so long that you feel pressure to not really sample. I was fortunate enough to come at a pretty odd time at night and try a few of the flavors before picking. The ice cream was super creamy and less sweet than ice cream I've had elsewhere which I really enjoyed. They also have yogurt varieties if you're feeling less indulgent.\n" u'Let me start by saying this seems like a nice place for the college kids here as a late night hangout.  Unfortunately I had the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream which #1 was not very good and #2 had only one piece of cookie dough in the entire scoop.  My wife got one of the peanut butter brownies which was also relatively dry and not very good.  Service was also quite slow.\n' u"One of my favorite places in Ithaca! Even though they usually have long lines they will let you try anything because they have some unusual flavors. My favorite is the yogurt-based flavor with peanut butter! I always get a waffle cone. You can get one scoop and still get two different flavors which is great for me because two scoops is always way too much. I haven't tried anything other than their ice cream but the baked goods always look tasty! The staff is super friendly and super speedy.\n" u'RUDE EMPLOYEES. My boyfriend and I ordered a sundae a la carte and each time I asked for an item the employee rolled her eyes. At the end she said in a rude tone "that\'s a sundae." When I received my sundae with the receipt she circled the order and wrote "OMG." If this is how purity treats its customers I will never return. Unacceptable!\n' u"I'm very pleasantly surprised by this little place. Not only do they offer vegan ice cream but it's very homey. Purity is reminiscent of a small town ice cream bar (it IS in a small town so no surprise) and it's also surprisingly cheap! For $5 you can get 3 scoops that more resemble 6 scoops. When I went the line was very long and there were a lot of people; quite a popular place.\n\nI got the coffee and cookies and cream flavored and they in no way lost to Haagen dazs. Just the right amount of creaminess; would definitely recommend!!\n" u'Great bang for your buck!  I got so much ice cream for the price I paid.  I had the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and Sea Salt Caramel on a waffle cone - amazing!\n' u'We\'d read odes to Purity and so included it among the different local brands we tried during a recent upstate swing unfortunately their product was the least successful of the three we tried. The line wasn\'t too bad when we arrived and shortly after placing it our order was ready for pick-up at the other side of their assembly-line operation (and no I don\'t mean assembly line in a good way part of the genuine ice cream parlor experience is seeing the person who takes your order actually fill your order!). Despite their interior design accentuating the noise level we sat inside to enjoy the air conditioning unfortunately we didn\'t much enjoy the ice cream. It wasn\'t as smooth and creamy as the Cornell Dairy Bar and it lacked the distinctive flavors of our order from a Byrne Dairy location indeed after looking at each other as much as we hate to throw away "good" food we decided Purity Ice Cream didn\'t meet that criteria dumped it and moved on. Now that we\'ve been there we won\'t be back!\n' u'O-M-G so much to choose from and so many good things. My heart was leaping for joy for this lovely place!\n\nThey have wonderful ice cream for people of different palates. The lines can be long but it\'s worth it and they have a great system of taking orders and picking up. I was sad I didn\'t notice the brownie sundae until after I already paid for my cone. I went simplistic and ordered a scoop of the chocolate bliss and the mint Oreo chocolate [I knew I should have written the names down but it\'s pretty self-explanatory]. Now the way you say the scoops can be deceiving! You can order a single scoop with two flavors or "two scoops" and choose two different ones. The sizes are VERY different. We found this out when I ordered and a friend ordered after me we both said it differently and got different sizes! The blueberry cheesecake is delicious as well the blueberries are so rich and you can really taste them in the ice cream.\n\nWhen you order you get a number and at the other end they call out the number as it\'s made. They are just that busy. Indoor and outdoor seating it was way too hot out when we came to visit to sit outdoors. Next time: brownie sundae.\n\nA must visit especially with kids!\n' u"Great ice cream. They have a lot of variety and options for vegans. The place is very popular but also has a lot of space to sit down. One of Ithaca's best.\n" u"Vastly overrated.\n\nLines way too long and after finally getting to the cashier I had to wait another 30 minutes to get an ice cream cone (no joke). \n\nFor this fact alone I look back with a longing for Purity before the renovation (the first renovation was good the second one not so much). It used to be a place to stop by quickly to grab a cone of ice cream. Now .. I don't know what it is.\n\nI read a review below that they have good breakfast with vegan options and I haven't tried that yet so this review does not pertain to their breakfast service. But I disagree with the reviewer about the decor! \n\nIt used to be (at least) a cute little place with a touch of old days where plastic was not as ubiquitous but now the place looks like a fast-food joint or those boxed diners like Denny's.  Tables are spaced out in a weird way - it reminds me of a college cafeteria or something.\n\n\nThere are many selections of ice cream flavors but like I said before nothing really interesting. They have five or so (or more) each of different kinds of chocolate or coffee themed flavors and frankly I can't tell the difference. A local ice cream parlor of Ithaca I wish would strive for innovative flavors - all natural organic non-GMO amazing local flavors that beg for more. \n\nI would go to Melissa's now - I really can't spend half an hour + just for a cone of ice cream.\n"]
177.Bart-Rich Enterprises,[]
145.Panera Bread,[u"I mean it's still Panera...but that being said definitely one of the cleaner and nicer outposts of the franchise. They have two kiosks for ordering in addition to the counter and are always super fast bringing out food. You're given a pager-type device which is placed on your table and that's how they know where to bring your food. \n\nMy go-to is the French onion soup in a bread bowl. Sometimes at other Panera franchises I'll find that they aren't great about taking enough of the bread out of the bread bowl so I'll end up with like three bites of soup but they were great about it here. The bread always tastes fresh and there's always an ample selection of baked goods. \n\nThere's one manager or something too who is always running around working so hard and asking customers who are done eating if she can take their garbage or plates. It's little touches like this that can turn your typical fast-casual experience into something at least a little nicer. \n\nExtremely clean on the inside with plenty of seating. Also a good amount of parking outside as well. Wait can be a little long on occasion as they do get some sports teams/prom groups/etc from the high schools in the area as well as Cornell and IC obviously but the line usually moves pretty quickly.\n" u"This is why I don't eat at Panera.  I ordered an egg white with avocado and spinach.    The teaspoon of avocado is in one lump.  Yes equivalent of 1 teaspoon.  I wish I  could post the picture.  Come on people!!!   Presentation is half the battle!!!  Oh and include the items in a decent proportion.  The cashier was great...Loved her but the food...Seems to be lacking.\n" u'Long line waiting for one cashier on duty at 9PM at night - thought I was outsmarting them to use the kiosk no one was using - ended up waiting literally 30 minutes for 2 half and half orders (nothing unique) to be made. Not given ANYTHING to accommodate for the wait - not even a drink. Considering we opted to go here for \'fast service\' it was a huge disappointment. Oh for being an out of town-er was surprised to see a "big" dog inside with owner that was eating - guess Ithaca is a dog friendly town??!! yet there wasn\'t water and biscuits at the door so not sure what\'s up with that\n' u"I gotta grilled cheese and only one of the bread was cut but it was pretty good. They say none of their products have coloring they're cookies do though. They're food is okay overall and they have a good variety\n" u"It's Panera so you know what you're getting:  fast high quality on the expensive side for fast food tasty. \n\nThis particular location has nice outdoor seating a drive thru and very friendly service. Inside seating isn't as cozy as some Paneras but there are a few nice family booths and plenty of tables for working/studying. \n\nOddly positioned wall fireplace without any couches or comfy chairs is a small bummer but not a deal breaker. \n\nAlways clean. Good place to go when you want a healthy lunch quick.\n" u'I regularly eat here and am always pleased with the quality. The staff are always friendly. I picked up catering here this morning and they did an outstanding job. Highly recommended.\n' u'Saddened to have to write this review but having to wait 20 min for two breakfast sandwiches when there were 3 other tables of people in the entire room. Having the staff say we ran out of eggs. Period. No apology no "hey sorry for the inconvenience" nada. I could have gone to Dunkin and got a flatbread breakfast sandwich within 3 min and it is roughly the same flavor. The customer experience at this large chain was lost - sadly...\n' u'The place seems to be becoming worse each time we come here. \nHad the Thai chicken wonton soup . really bad with too much soy sauce and no chicken in dumpling that we could taste .\nAlso had the black bean soup. Again very tasteless with just beans \nOnly good thing was the Mediterranean sandwich.\n' u"I love the autumn soup!  I always get the Asiago bagel with cream cheese.    It's always fast and easy. Parking is sometimes an issue.   The chicken tortellini is always a favorite\n" u'Three out of four of us enjoyed our sandwiches but spouse hate hate HATED her grilled cheese: American cheese too much bread overpriced.\n' u"Typical Panera. I secretly love Panera and its a very good option when you want something fast but don't want to eat too unhealthy. Plus the nice thing is you can customize your order very easily to what you want - for example whenever I get a sandwich I always ask for it on wheat bread and so on...the sandwich are all delicious the soups are perfect for a cold winter day and the summer salad when they're in season are delicious! Tons of seating and the line moves fast generally\n" u"While the food itself was fine the management and services seems to need improvement. First they were out of stock of something I ordered but it seems the cashier hadn't been updated on that. Then when they brought my order out they didn't get it quite right and as I looked at my receipt and it was also incorrect. A similar thing happened to the table next to ours where they ordered something but they were out of stock and the table behind us was assumed that they wanted whipped cream without asking first.\n" u"It's a typical Panera Bread eatery. It's a lot cleaner than some other fast foods around town. Depending on when you go you're gonna get service immediately or you're going to wait for a significantly long time. Either way the food is always fresh and the staff is always friendly. They've added the kiosks now and have the online ordering to simply and speed the process. They have also added the pagers and bring the food TO you rather than crowd around the counter for your order. Atmosphere is typical standard issue sweatshirt yoga pants Ugg boots and iPhone (with a side of Frat boy gym shorts) but the sit-and-study vibe works out well. Go for a You-Pick-Two soup and sandwich. Get the Mac and cheese and a baguette.\n" u"Middling food and pretty awful service.\n\nI went in mid-morning and the woman who helped me at the counter was obviously agitated about something going on. She brusquely took my order and literally -threw- my receipt at me. I have to admit that's a new one for me. The food came out pretty quickly and it was decent. The coffee was somewhere between Starbucks and convenience store quality.\n\nMy wife came in about 5 minutes later and waited for at least 5 minutes at the counter to place an order. They weren't busy--there was simply no employee visible for at least 5 minutes. The same lady eventually emerged and took her order. Fortunately she seemed to have escaped the receipt missile.\n\nHer food came out quickly as well and was decent. However the hot tea was a disaster. The restaurant put out a pot of hot water for making coffee that had previously been used for coffee. Ask any tea drinker and they will tell you that the absolute worst thing in the world to do to a cup of tea is to make it using coffee-flavored water. Disgusting.\n\nGet your act together folks.\n" u"Yay! finally a bougie fast food joint in Ithaca. If you couldn't tell I am being sarcastic. This place uses sit down restaurant prices and ingredients ruined by an atmosphere that is at best a fast paced frenzy. The food is thrown at you in literally 2 minutes from ordering probably faster than McDonald's. I either want to sit down and enjoy a good quality meal or fill myself up for cheap. I never really have the desire for a combination of food that is fast dainty and expensive. Just a weird combination to me. Not horrible food or anything I just hate the concept.\n\nIts kind of like an upscale subway and to me that just defeats the purpose.\n" u'I am a big fan of Panera Bread. The Ithaca store has the same food quality as that of other stores in the U.S. However the ambiance is not as nice and clean as many of the locations I have been to. I would have given 4 stars if the store was a bit cleaner.\n' u'Today I had the worst Panera experience of my life at the Ithaca location. Usually everything is fine but today was completely terrible. At first it seemed okay considering my family and I waited until we thought the lunch rush would be over (about 2:30) to go. There was no line to order. I had asked for the Pick 2 with a chicken caesar salad and mac n cheese and an iced green tea but by that time of the day they were already out of mac n cheese as well as the green tea. I quickly chose something else and my family and I got our drinks and sat down to wait. Literally 30 minutes later our food was brought to us. Way too long of a wait for a "fast food" type restaurant. When the food did come 3/4 salads did not have dressing and my mom\'s "Asian salad" consisted of lettuce chicken and sliced almonds. That\'s it. Many people around us were told that their orders had to be changed because certain things had run out and at least 3 people around me had received their meal and it turned out to be wrong. On my way out I warned others about my experience. Totally sucked although the manager was very nice and worked extremely hard to try to keep things running smooth- I felt bad for her.\n' u"They style themselves an upscale bakery but Panera Bread is really just a soup salad and sandwich eatery with counter service. The food's not bad but the slim portions high prices and general air of confusion behind the counter make it tough to justify a return visit. I've written more at 14850 Dining.\n\nhttp://dining.14850.com/directory/panera\n" u'DAYYUMMN. These panini sandwiches be warm n gooey n flavorfill lyk u never SEEN. Tomato basil bread loaf be lyk Beyonce on my Jay-Z. Deli artists be mean tho. One them wudn\'t even let me holla. I lyk "plz u ugly n e wey."\n' u'Excellent food and spacious location! If you want creative soups salads and sandwiches this is a great place for lunch. Quiche and pastries are yummy in the morning. Not sure why people complain about parking; there is huge lot adjacent for overflow.\n']
102.Glenwood Pines,[u"Along with Fargo Glenwood Pines easily has some of the best burgers in Upstate New York let alone the Ithaca area. The sides aren't groundbreaking but worth a try.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed the staff friendly and attentive. It's clear the patrons love the place and that people who go there once are likely to visit again.\n\nWe're eager to go back soon.\n" u"Delightful cozy local joint. This is where the locals eat and when you visit you will know why! Quaint comfortable atmosphere for dining or bar. Delicious burgers fish fry and sides but... wait! Don't miss out on the specials like the blackened catfish sandwich or (if your lucky) the compost burger! Go by have a pint and a meal or some appetizers. Ask to have your burger dressed the way you please they're happy to accommodate. Watch a game play some pool or (seriously) Ms. Pacman. Try to grab a seat with a view of the lake!\n" u'Fantastic burgers. I got the double pine burger cooked medium-rare. To my surprise both burgers were ACTUALLY MEDIUM-RARE! My father got the fired haddock. One word. Heavenly. The breeding tasted like a savory pancake and the fish was butter-soft. The fish is caught fresh every other day. The service was also fantastic. We ordered and got our food within 5 minutes. The waiter was friendly and we had a great view of Cayuga lake. 10/10 would recommend.\n' u'Cool little local bar and resto. Great burger and beer selection. We got our meal to go and it was ready pretty fast. We ordered fries and Buffalo fried shrimp as sides and the portions were tiny. But the burgers were amazing and the Cajun rice and chicken soup was delicious. Would probably go back but maybe not order the sides.\n' u"Amazing burger! Everything rocked. I'll keep writing words so Yelp lets me post this.\n" u'This cannot be the best burger in Ithaca. I was anticipating something special and got mediocre. The idea that because something is fresh it\'s good is too simplistic. The "Pine Burger" I had was lamely dressed and the bacon I asked for wasn\'t there. If your going to boast that you have the best burger in town more attention should be paid to the quality of the ingredients used to top the burger!  Disappointed in Ithaca.\n' u"It's always a treat to have the Pinesburger! The bloody Mary's are delish too! Can't wait to come back to the area and dine again! Make sure you get the onion rings they are super yummy!\n" u'Great little diner with a nice view of Lake Cayuga.  Pinewood Burger was cooked exactly as requested and delicious. Sides are extra but all prices are quite reasonable.  Deep fried cauliflower was quite good as were the onion rings. My husband raved about the haddock and we will definitely return on our next trip to Ithaca. Waitress was wonderful and service was prompt. Take a drive and enjoy!\n' u'Burgers are great but the bread overwhelmed the flavor. Service was incredibly good. Having to pay for a side kind of a bummer since a burger always needs an accompaniment. Great pricing but need to see larger portion or sides added for free. Just an opinion.\n' u"Great local eatery with real beer battered Haddock great clam and corn chowders and little  steamers. We finished the meal with great caramel  apple pie and rice pudding (although I don't normally like cold rice pudding this was rather palatable)\nThey have decent selection of local beers ginger beer and Ithaca root beer to wash it all down with :)\n" u"Have past this place many times and it's always busy finally decided to give it a try for lunch.  Started with the corn chowder which was delicious.  Between the 3 of us we tried the fresh fish sandwich the crunch burger and the steak sandwich.  We enjoyed all 3 as they were tasty and perfectly prepared.  Sides are extra my son tried the French Fries they were definitely frozen not fresh but tasted fine.  \nService was fast we were greeted as we walked in and seated right away.  Service was quick to take our drink and food order and very attentive.  Decor is rustic bar feel but clean.  Would definitely stop again.\n" u'Pig wings were great as was the Pines burger my friend had. Attentive bartenders and wait staff. Great dive bar ambience with a surprising amount of seating capacity. Cheap good food.\n' u"I love the Glenwood Pines. Even after graduating Cornell over 20 years ago I still make sure to stop by for a pinesburger. I love how it's got a fun family environment decently priced food and a good bar. I don't love the fact that you have to pay a lot for sides but hey it's homemade. Overall the food is a 3.5 star but worth stopping by if you're coming through Ithaca.\n" u'If you find yourself in Ithaca New York do yourself a favor and take the scenic ride up the west side of Cayuga Lake and try this gem of a restaurant.  The Pinesburger is hands down the best burger in New York State!  In house ground beef and locally baked rolls make this a taste sensation!  While the fries are frozen and not my favorite the delicious burger more than makes up for that minor flaw.  This is not fancy or gourmet burger but just plain tasty every time.\n' u"Just about my favourite place to eat in New York. I love the relaxed atmosphere and the food isn't bad either. The open steak sandwich is beautiful and add any two included sides from a long list and you're in for a good meal. \n\nThe homemade slaw is amazing and is always one of my two sides. The chips (I'm British so they're chips not fries!) are always fluffy on the inside and crisp outside just as they should be. \n\nService is always great. The servers are attentive without being intrusive and always get our orders to us quickly and accurately. \n\nIf I'm ever in Ithaca I always try to get here. You should too.\n" u'I got the double pineswood burger with thousand island sauce and crabcake on the side. They were very good but what really did it for me was the kentucky derby pie. PLEASE GET THE PIE.\n' u"Oh man I love this place! Beautiful view! Family oriented! Just great food! I love the burgers on the French loaf bread! Yum! The rice pudding reminds me of my dad's which I love! My favorite place in Ithaca!\n" u'One of my favorite places to eat in Ithaca when visiting my kids a t school. Sick of waiting for hours in town to get into a restaurant this place is for you. Very cool local atmosphere. cozy bar with bowling machine and pinball to pass the time if you have to wait for a table. The food is simple and tasty. The drinks are inexpensive. Good beer selection.  Try the Pines  Challengevery doable and you win a cool shirt. If your looking for a local and not fancy place to eat this place is for you.\n' u"I am a regular at the Pines and almost always go for the Pinesburger you can't get a better burger for  $6.49 anywhere. Atmosphere has not changed one bit since I first went there as a teen. My grown children have great memories of the food and the bowling machine.\n" u'After checking out Taughannock Falls a few miles away I passed by this place and thought I\'d give it a try. Despite being known for having a "famous" burger I didn\'t try it because a lot of the reviews here were pretty mixed. They have a pretty diverse menu so I thought I\'d give something else a try. I went for the pig wings and fries instead. The fries were pretty good - they were crispy and salty enough that I didn\'t need to use ketchup or anything else. The pig wings were really tender and came with a good amount of sauce. However I wish they could have provided more since two was really not enough considering the price.\n\nThe waitress was a bit slow in taking my order despite there not being that many customers at the time but she did apologize for it and served my food very quickly following that.\n\nI really like the interior of the restaurant as well. The outside makes it look like some boring roadside diner but the inside looks like a log cabin.\n']
193.Little Tokyo,[u'Don\'t be too tempted by the "Half Price Rolls" on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Don\'t get me wrong - the sushi isn\'t bad (although its nothing special either) - but it is not worth the inevitable wait. I have been to Little Tokyo two times on Thursdays and both times it was a 2+ hour ordeal. They simply don\'t have enough staff but with the rather expensive state of sushi in Ithaca the half price nights still keep people coming. \n\nOn my last visit I was in a party of 6 people. 5 of us had sushi and 1 ordered from the Japanese/Korean menu. The guy that ordered from the menu got his Bi Bim Bop (nothing compared to the awesome BBB at Four Seasons) in about 10min. The first sushi came out about 20min later and each order kind of trickled out over the course of another 20min. I don\'t know about you but I just don\'t consider it acceptable to be served my dinner 40min after the first meal came out. \n\nCheck it out if have time to kill and have maybe one other person with you but don\'t bother trying to go with a group. Unless the sushi and service are better on the regular price nights I wouldn\'t pay the full price.\n']
12.Simeon‚Äôs on the Commons,[u"I love the interior of Simeon's and their lively ambiance. It's a smaller space good for smaller groups. \nThe food is beautifully plated and rather innovative in choice of ingredient combinations though they don't have that many options (drinks menu is extensive). The small plates are tapas-style and definitely small for the price. Entrees are perfectly sized: you won't be bursting nor hungry by the end and satisfied with the taste and presentation. \nI had the pork tenderloin cooked medium rare. It was tender and I loved the bed of spaetzle and raisins an interesting and flavorful accompaniment. My boyfriend got the flat iron steak (medium rare) though ever so slightly on the rare side. I DO like rare steaks and thought it had a good beefy flavor with juicy tenderness. \nThey offer you a choice of little cups of dessert which include chocolate cake apple crumble dulce de leche etc and you can get as many or all if you want. Light and refreshing sweetness to the end of a meal!\nOverall I really enjoyed my experience and actually would be interested in trying their other entrees. On the pricier side for what they offer but still worth it!\n" u'After moving to Ithaca this summer and hearing of what happened to the old version of Simeon\'s I was excited at the prospect of having someplace "new" to eat on the commons. \n\nI was neither impressed nor disappointed with this place. I though the service was great the hostess and waitress were both very friendly and helpful but there was really nothing that would have me running back to this place.\n\nI ordered the house rigatoni and my friend ordered the steak. The rigatoni description reads as follows: House made Rigatoni Pasta: braised lamb brussels sprout leaves parsnip pure\xe8 rosemary gremolata. First off the portion size was so small! Within an hour of finishing my food I was hungry again and ended up getting a burger from somewhere else. I\'m fine with not filling my plate the brim with food but if I\'m spending almost $30 for pasta I expect a hearty dish. The lamb was shaved and shredded and every few bites I was able to snag some of it onto my fork. Same with the Brussel sprout leaves it seemed like they took literally one sprout and broke the leaves off to mix in the dish. In addition my dish was lukewarm when I started eating it. I enjoyed what small and warm portion I did have I just was disappointed with what I got overall. \nThe steak seemed like it was good quality I had a few bites and it melted like butter so that\'s always a plus in my book!\nWe also got a small apple crisp desert that was light on the sugar but still tasty if only they had served it hot instead of cold.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my meal and my experience but between the portion of the food the limited menu items (there\'s 8 things to choose from) and the lukewarm to cold dishes I won\'t come back anytime soon. \n\nThis was my first outing at one of Ithaca\'s finer dining restaurants so hopefully there\'s a more upward trend with the other places in town.\n' u"I've been here twice sjnce they reopened. The food is absolutely fabulous and the oysters are of great quality. I have only had one experience in which i didn't like my entree. However the staff were really accomodating and prepared it over. They also added a free mini desert. This place is a bit on the pricey side but you will not leave disappointed!!!\n" u'The beer selection here is pretty good. There is a focus on craft beers and local  beers brewed in New York State.\n\nWe had a tapas style meal here. We shared tuna tartar lettuce tacos bacon wrapped shrimp a portobello mushroom burger and a charcuterie board. The items had a great balance of flavors. My favorite was the tuna tartar lettuce tacos which came with a whipped wasabi butter. It was a light dish yet I felt it had one of the widest ranges of flavors. \n\nThe decor and atmosphere are quite modern. I think it is a good venue for a date.\n' u'Had the combo dozen oysters featuring three garnishes. Oysters were unexpectedly very fresh and light with one briny type out of the three (all were still great). Drinks selection was a nice mix of craft beers and wines along with specialty cocktails. Portions for the small dishes were small (of course) but the GRILLED OCTOPUS!!!!! Amaze. Also the charcuterie was weirdly satisfying. Double thumbs up for the crostini.\n' u"Our server was really nice and attentive but the food took forever to come out and we didn't order much. The food was fine but $120 (after tip) for two entrees an app and two drinks seems like a bit much. I dunno. Definitely wasn't a terrible experience but won't be back.\n" u"I wish we could give half stars as I would give this place 4.5 stars. This was our first visit to the new Simeon's and we really enjoyed it. The place is very well decorated and has a great feel to it. The menu had lots of good choices and the specials were interesting. My husband and I shared the bacon appetizer and loved it. I had the steak and he had a lamb special that were both tasty and interesting. The desserts in the small cups were a great idea which we thoroughly enjoyed. The only reason we didn't give 5 stars is the waiter. While very nice he was a bit all over the place. It was hard to understand him and get his attention.\n" u'Great atmosphere friendly staff and owners. Food is undescribably wonderful. Came for brunch and taking lunch home because there was so much we wanted to try.\n' u"I am so glad Simeon's is back and as good as ever. My husband and I agree it's the best meal we've had in Ithaca in a while. Our waitress was wonderful and convinced us to try the beef tartare to start. Amazing! If I had to be picky I may say the menu is a little short and perhaps a little on the pricier side. The service beer & wine menus and ambiance are all stellar. I am convinced there is no better place to enjoy a meal and people watch on the Commons.\n" u"Food is overpriced and mediocre. Kettle chips and cheese really? Gross. Waitress brought the check before we finished eating (place was empty) and came back to get the check/money but we still weren't done! Desserts were great though. We will NEVER go back. I recommend going elsewhere!!\n" u'Very lovely new space.  Was very excited to check it out.\nIt was surprising that the website online did not reflect the accurate menu at the restaurant. When I inquired about this I was told the management hadn\'t gotten around to putting up the "new" menu yet.  \n\nBurgers were $17 and a top shelf martini $14----\nOur food was above average but not worth these prices.\n\nNo Spanish red wines either.\nDisappointing.\n' u'I loved the food and service here! Second floor has great view and the music was good too.\n' u'Lunch menu was delicious. Pork sandwich was not doused in sauce which allowed the rich meat to come out. Coupled with a soft roll and the crazy good apple slaw non-stop awesome. $11 but worth it. Downer - high price for beer...$7 for 3/4 pint. Service was great as well...\n' u"Food was good but they blatantly gave us bad service for being Asian. Waitress ignored our request for the check then the bartender prioritized many smaller things while our tab was ready to be closed in plain sight. Disappointing because the food was really good. If you read the reviews it's all minorities giving 3- star reviews! You've been warned!\n" u"...I just bought a $9 after dollar tip Bell's Two Hearted Ale...  The interior is nice and all but my Bell's was $9...\n" u"Very glad Simeon's is back. The menu is simple but that allows them to focus on what they offer. Everything we had was delicious and brought to our table very quickly. In addition for a fancy-ish bistro the final bill was surprisingly affordable. Still not cheap but the prices seemed fair. The staff was friendly and attentive the dessert menu was creative and the atmosphere was casual but romantic.\n" u'We were so excited to see our very favorite Ithaca resteraunt open again after several years of rebuilding. We knew the menu was limited and also understood they needed to be a bit different than several other places in close proximity. Even taking that into consideration we were very disappointed. The bar was so poorly stocked so as not to be able to mix not one but 2 popular drinks making lame excuses as to why. Blamed their vendor.  The "eclectic" burger was dry and tasteless. The menu selection was so contrived in order to be special that 2 of our party had really no choice but a dry burger with a chunk of unmelted cheddar on them. The cucumber mignonette did not compliment the oysters in any way. Bottom line they are trying too hard to be special when they were special in the old days by serving just plain good food. We\'ll try again with hopes they will see the light and combine some of the old and the new into this beautifully rebuilt space.\n' u"The food here was tasty enough and the decor was nice and new but for what we got I'd say it wasn't worth the price. $55 for a piece of salmon and a chicken parm is quite a bit!\n" u"The service is top-notch here. Our server was efficient and friendly and he even brought another person over to our table when we asked about menu options that would be good for our daughter who has a food allergy. She sat down with our daughter and spent time going through the whole menu to show her what she could order. Even though the place doesn't look like many kids come in to dine (probably because of the prices) but they were very nice to her.\n\nOn the topic of prices: The food is very good but I give 4 stars because the prices are very high for what you get. The menu is inventive and there are some good ideas but execution is a bit off and a lot of things end up kind of average. They are tasty enough but they don't knock it out of the park.\n\nThe beer menu is mediocre and they do have some creative cocktails.\n" u"I feel the need to update my review. My last review was for a prior menu. Their new menu has prices that border outrageous for Ithaca. They don't even give you bread with your entree so you can order a $25 entree and simply receive that. It'll be good but not anything particularly amazing. Instead I choose now to go to places like Agava or Ciao and for $25 I can have an appetizer entree and possibly even a drink or dessert. Additionally these places both serve chips or bread to start. It's become kind of a no brainer for a college student.\n\nHowever the brunch is still good.\n"]
19.Mahogany Grill,[u"I am hooked on their Garlic Parmesan Wings with blue cheese.  Wyatt has been the cook/chef for three of my orders and has consistently done an outstanding job.  They are scrumptious beyond belief.  I love that I can rely on his cooking skills to deliver.  It's a relief after a long stressful day.\n\nThe bartenders are craftsmen/women and have never served me a bad cocktail.\n\nThank you and Mazel Tov.\n" u'We stopped in here recently because the 45 minute wait outside of Just A Taste just wasn\'t worth it in subzero temperatures.  I feel bad saying that as I imagine Mahogany Grill gets a lot of people that didn\'t want to wait to get into Just A Taste.  That said I was already disappointed when I walked in (Boy: "Why can\'t we go to Viva?") since it wasn\'t what I had planned and if you read my reviews you already know I\'m a hard sell.\n\nWe were seated immediately at a high top in the bar area.  No tables available in the dining room.  Our waiter was very kind courteous humorous and patient.  He was totally understanding when we told him we weren\'t even sure we were staying.  I finally said to hell with it and ordered a glass of wine and settled into their menu.  My wine was superb.  While we waited we were served a lovely little plate of baguette toast with a really delicious and savory tomato dipping oil.  So good.  \n\nMy caesar salad was nothing short of yum.  Perfect size perfect dressing.  My husband ordered the pork ragout with rigatoni and said it was exactly what he wanted but not as much as he had expected on his plate for the price.  My son ordered spaghetti and meatballs which were nearly as big as his eyes were that night.  I tasted some and thought the sauce was a little off a little too sweet maybe but I personally prefer a saltier sauce. For such large meatballs I had a feeling they\'d be gamey or chewy or weird in general but they were really pretty tasty and as an Italian I\'m very much a snob when it comes to eating italian food in any restaurant especially one that isn\'t particularly italian.  I am also cheap when I feel the menu is too pricey.  I ordered the $15 bacon burger with fries.  Oh good lord those fries.  They were crisp and salty on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  There was no sharing those fries so do not ask me.  I ordered my burger medium and it definitely came medium-rare.  I noticed the girl at the table next to me had sent hers back just as we sat down.  I should have sent mine back but didn\'t.  Ate 75% of it.  It was obviously juicy and definitely edible and it had an odd taste to it I couldn\'t place but not in a totally negative way.  Still ate it.  I can\'t even really complain about it...I mean I ate it.\n\nWe passed on dessert and didn\'t even look at the menu.  My only true complaint here is the price.  I think they\'re catering to a crowd with fatter pockets than ours.  $20 for my kid to eat spaghetti and meatballs.  $30 for my husband to eat (essentially) pasta and shredded pork....two things I can easily whip up at home for under $50.  Everything is a la carte.  So salads etc are a separate charge.  Our bill was over $100.  That hurt.  However I would go back for drinks and if I\'m tipsy enough I\'d probably fork out the cash to eat there again.  I\'d leave my kid at home though to relieve some of the pain.\n\nSpecial thanks to our waiter he really was awesome and I can\'t remember his name.  Nice guy.  It was Saturday March 11 around 5:30 if the manager is reading and wants to narrow it down and send him our kudos.  \n\nI should probably apologize for what is certainly a somewhat schizophrenic review.\n' u'I had a nice brunch at Mahogany Grill; the food was very good and the server was very friendly. However the restaurant hired Wyatt Piazza a young man who was recently arrested for dealing prescription drugs in Ithaca. Although I has no interaction with Wyatt at the restaurant he sent me a personal text message that stated "Never come to my restaurant again. I don\'t want your business." After I called to speak to the owner about his unprofessional and inappropriate conduct he sent me another message stating "Stop calling/having people call the restaurant. I\'m the head chef they aren\'t going to fire me."\n\nI spent nearly $50 on brunch and was grossly mistreated by an employee and received no apology from management. Mahogony Grill should train their employees that they should not personally text customers and be professionals. I am very disappointed with my experience and the lack of response from management about the situation.  I would never recommend this restaurant to a friend and none of my friends will be returning as the restaurant clearly does not value their customers. Simeon\'s and Just a Taste are much better meals have professional employees and value their customers.\n' u'Very much enjoyed our visit to the Mahogany Grill. Our waiter was efficient and had great recommendations. The wine list is very strong. This is an old style Italian place were they call the red stuff they serve over pasta Sunday Gravy made with pork veal and beef. We had a large Mediterranean salad the chicken parm and pork Ragu over pasta. All excellent!! They have good choices for vegetarians with white bean burgerseggplant and pasta marinara. Maybe a new goto place.\n' u"We visited Mahogany Grill with a group of 8 and a few conditions that other restaurants in this section of Ithaca couldn't meet. Namely a place that seat our group comfortably didn't have too much seafood on the menu and had some gluten-free options. Mahogany met all those so we decided to give it a try. Up until then I had only come in here to sit at the bar and have a beer.\n\nFirst I'm happy to report that the service was quite nice and up to the professional standard I expect at this price point. Our server happily dealt with our table and was just as good with a semi-grumpy teenager as she was with the older adults. That's a great plus in my book.\n\nThe food I'd say is delicious and fresh with preparation presentation and quality I expect for the prices. Mahogany Grill is not cheap with most entrees around the $15-$20 mark but you get good value for what you pay. I noted earlier reviews commenting that the food was not as good quality so perhaps they have now adjusted their recipes and presentation.\n\nCheck them out--you won't be disappointed!\n" u"Really really good stuff. Took my parents here this weekend while they were visiting me at Cornell and they were very happy with the food and nice outdoor seating.\n\nI personally got the prime rib sandwich which was although a bit messy and overstuffed quite delicious.\n\nAfter much insistence on our waiter's part we got the peanut butter mousse pie desert which was outstanding. I highly recommend that to finish off the meal but save room for it!\n\nI'll definitely be back. Great restaurant for special occasions when you want to spend a bit more.\n" u'Was excited to try the new menu but walked out disappointed. Chopped salad had  a large chunk red pepper on top of ice burg lettuce. Feta cheese was hard to find in the salad. The rest of my diners food was okay but not worth the price. The waiter forgot to refill drinks and when he brought dessert he set it down in the middle of the dirty dishes and never cleared the table.   This used to be one of my favorite places in Ithaca but not sure I will return.\n' u"My meal at Mahogany Grill wasn't intentional but it was well worth it. We were looking to go to the Tapas Bar right next door but when we walked in no one helped us and the waitress saw us and walked away so we promptly also walked away. \n\nAnyways the seating arrangement at Mahogany is nice. There are high tops and lower tables. Slightly tight but it's a restaurant in a crowded downtown area so it's to be expected. \n\nThe server was very nice and very helpful. \n\nI got the Mac and cheese off the shareable sides menu because it sounded phenomenal and I didn't plan on sharing it. It was delicious. They used shells which are the best vessels for cheese a girl could hope for. \n\nTheir bread was delicious as well. Try not to fill up before your meal though. \n\nA little pricy but again to be expected from a restaurant in a competitive crowded downtown area. Though if you eat just Mac n cheese it's more than filling for only $9. I'm a bargain hunter.\n" u"When you pour stout you've got to let it rest. First rule of bartending!  The restaurant look and feel is of an upscale restaurant/bar but if you don't know how to put stout ( and pour  it in Yuengling glass) that is a non starter.\n" u'Italian! Just went for the updated Italian menu and I was not disappointed! Fantastic Italian cuisine (coming from an Italian) and great sauce. My new go to for Italian in Ithaca.\n' u'Mahogany had been described to me as the nicest restaurant in the Commons and the place you take your parents to when they are footing the bill. After exploring Ithaca for the last month I would have to agree that it is on the pricier side and definitely caters to folks who have in the words of Dierks Bentley some jangle in their pockets. All the entrees are in the $18 to $30 range and while they sell several "shareable sides" I am not sure if these would be filling enough for a meal. The free bread and sauce is delightful however. I went with their signature burger minus the bacon and it was really good. The sweet potato fries as my side were a wise choice. I actually couldn\'t even finish the burger and took half of it home. This is a great restaurant for people who don\'t mind spending a few bucks and I am sure they make quick work among the "first date" crowd.\n' u'After reading some of the reviews other people have written about Mahogany Grill I feel lucky that I had such a good experience- perhaps the food was bad other times or perhaps there is a really rude owner (with whom I did not personally interact) but I did not share these negative experiences. \nI came with my boyfriend\'s family about a month ago and again for graduation weekend (although we just had appetizers and drinks at the bar during graduation). \nThe first time we came we were seated immediately and the server was really sweet friendly and engaging. I can\'t remember the name of the cocktail I got on the first night and after looking at the list online I think they may have taken it off the menu but I thought it was really tasty. My boyfriend and his mom both got the French Greyhound (vodka St. Germaine grapefruit juice lime soda) and it was really good but not super original. \nFor appetizers we ordered the arancini and the crab cakes. The arancini were amazing (we got them again when we came for graduation weekend and the recipe had changed but they were still really excellent). The crab cakes were tasty and despite being small had a good crab-to-bread ratio. The chutney on top the crab cakes was kinda strange though. If I got them again I would ask for the crab cakes with just the aioli. \nA few members of my boyfriend\'s family got the gnocchi for their entree and I believe they all enjoyed it. I got a burger and asked for it cooked medium rare. Realistically it was probably closer to medium but considering I\'ve been a lot of places where medium rare can be interpreted as "well done" I wasn\'t too disappointed. The burger was tasty huge and the portion of fries along with it was generous as well. \nWe didn\'t order dessert and I thought the presentation was really goofy and weird. The waitress brought out a tray of all these like presentation desserts and went through describing each one. A menu would have been sufficient.\n\nWhen we returned for graduation weekend we didn\'t have a reservation (we had an event on Friday night that served heavy hors d\'oeuvres and so we only wanted a quick bite late at night) and they had enough seats available at the bar to fit us. As aforementioned we ordered the arancini again and also got the calamari to share (amazing fantastic breading ratio and contains cherry peppers which I love in my calamari). The two sauces were served underneath the calamari and were great but I would have asked for them on the side next time because I prefer to dip. I had a regular mojito and my boyfriend asked for some drink on the menu that was basically a mojito except with tequila instead of rum which was kinda stupid and wasn\'t very good.\n' u"This is really a 3.5 star because of some redeeming factors.\n\nSpontaneous dinner at Mahogany was actually a pleasant surprise. The last time I was here I remember getting 1) truffle fries which is what we did again and devoured with non-remorseful pleasure. We were hungry so we started off our appetizer game strong: 2) The arancini balls - also a great appetizer. Crispy cheesy mushroomy. There were too many things to try so I got a side of 4) cauliflower with cheddar. I didn't expect mac & cheese texture but it was not bad. I also got 5) Seafood gumbo which had soooo much potential but it was soo salty :( I brought this home & ate with rice which was a good save.\nI also took a bit of my friend's duck sandwich and THAT was delicious.\n\nSo in general depending on what you got the food could be stellar or not so much. \nI've been here for brunch I wouldn't be too excited for that tbh. But dinner is quite alright.\n" u'Dinner was great. The crispy Thai coconut wings were amazing! Had the backend Mahi Mahi on Caesar salad. Just as good! Service was great definitely coming back\n' u'This is a "go to" staple in Ithaca.  My favorite place (so far) in town.  Kind of a fine dining bar.  Dining room is a little small so getting a table can be tough especially when the sidewalk seating is unavailable which is eight months a year.  Big long bar.  I have been several times and most recently yesterday.  I think the beer menu is a tad short in this day and age.  However the service is always great.  When you go you must try the Thai wings they are truly unique and incredibly good.   All the appetizers have been good.  The menu has started to lean towards Italian of late.   Highly recommended.\n' u"Was at mahogany grill on a Saturday night four of us plus one dog. We waited for about a good 40 minutes because the hostess working that night gave away our table to another party who came 10 minutes after us. Our waitress was great wish I had her name. The food was really good. I would go back again if I'm ever in Ithaca but I would look to make sure the same hostess isn't at the door.\n" u"My husband and I enjoyed the Tapas we had last night. We chose to sit inside as it was a warm night and we had spent the day outdoors. Our waiter Michael was personable and knowledgable. The room was dark but pleasant. Tables were a comfortable distance apart. Drinks were refilled often which we appreciate. \n\n\nCrab cakes were tasty made with lots of yummy crab instead of filler or laden with breadcrumbs. Macaroni and cheese was creamy with a great combo of cheese and a nice dried mustard edge. Grilled asparagus with balsamic was very tasty albeit a bit oilier than I'd like. \n\nI'd recommend dining here for a good meal in the Ithaca area. We haven't found many places here that we've enjoyed but Mahogany was certainly one of the good ones.\n" u'I wanted to express my sincere apologies to the woman I spoke with at Mahogany Grill one morning a couple weeks ago. I was calling around town for options for dinner during what turned out to be one of the Cornell University\'s Graduation weekends. I\'m not familiar with the area but I saw Mahogany Grill had nice reviews. I figured like most major restaurants in the area they were probably booked that weekend but it doesn\'t hurt to ask. Right?\n\nA woman answers the phone "Mahogany Grill." She didn\'t give a name and I\'m sorry I didn\'t notice her initial tone. It should have been my first clue she was not having the best of days but perhaps my hopeful demeanor may help. Some people do say "First impressions are lasting impressions." I politely asked if there were possibly any available times for the particular date we were looking for. She responded with "how many people?" and I gave her the number expected in our party. Without even a second\'s hesitation she said "we\'re booked" and immediately hung up.  \n\nI clearly interrupted her day with an inquiry that was most likely wasting her time. My bad. At least she was very efficient with what little time she had to spare for me by giving me quick succinct and to the point responses. I did get three responses during our conversation after all which perhaps may be more then some people get in this age of online automation and texting. She does seem very good at her job as she didn\'t\' even need a second to look up the date/time I gave her. I also do appreciate her apparent interest in my limited phone plan to make sure I didn\'t stay on line any longer then truly necessary. Caring and Customer Service!\n\nMy apologies for my family\'s last minute search to find a local business to patron and give our money to. I regret any inconvenience. It\'s clearly our fault and my foolish inquiry into availability was a bit disruptive to a staff member\'s day.\n\nSo to the woman I spoke with though so briefly I hope your day improved and became full of sunshine and cute puppies. Perhaps my family will have an opportunity to experience dining at your establishment on another day. \n\nThanks for your time!\n' u'Great first experience. Great service from the bartender. Perfectly cooked steaks. This is definitely the nicest restaurant on the Commons. The food and ambiance are better here than at John Thomas probably the only other steakhouse within 25 miles. Will definitely return.\n' u'Would have given this a 4 if we would have been seated promptly.  Husband and I stopped in for dinner.  Told there was a wait for a party of 2.  No problem we would wait- except 3 parties of 4 also no reservations came in after us and were seated promptly.  I would have even been okay if they explained that they would only seat us at a table for 2 but no explanation so I am left to conclude that is their practice.  I had the vegan pasta.  It was good plentiful and perfect for a chilly night.  Hubby had a steak that was cooked to perfection.  Both of us had soup  the French Onion and Clam Chowder- both were hits with us.  Service was pleasant and attentive enough for our taste.\n']
47.Northstar House,[u"Brunch here was good. I had the chicken and donuts which were good but not amazing. The donuts were the best part - light but with sufficient glaze to be pleasantly sweet. And the breading of the chicken was amazing. It had a great spice level and was nice and crunchy. Unfortunately the chicken itself was a little greasy which put me off a bit.\n\nIn my party two people got the sausage special from the menu and found it to be not exactly what they expected. It ended up being basically a sausage sandwich with a huge dollop of hollandaise sauce on top. Both of them said that the sausage was too think for a sandwich and they didn't like that the sandwich dripped sauce as they ate it. They said the flavors were good but the setup of the dish just wasn't great.\n\nEveryone seemed to like the drinks they got and the staff were really nice to us.\n\nOverall it definitely has promise as a brunch venue. Would surely go back and just try some different things next time.\n" u'I have only been to Northstar for Brunch...but don\'t let that deter you from reading further. \n\nI love this place and will go back time and time again. The first visit I ordered Fried Chicken and Donuts. Both of which were A+. The donuts were a nice alternative to waffles too! The second visit I tried the French Toast. I wasn\'t a fan of the "du jour topping" I think it tasted like pumpkin spice or squash? But other than that I enjoyed it. The french bread alternative was great. I was worried the toast would be a little soggy but they cooked it in such a way that it has a nice balance of crunch and softness. I\'ve also been to their new "Casita" a few times and have always enjoyed their drinks and the appetizers that were there (although I\'m not sure if the apps are made by them). \n\nThis is an Ithaca fave for me so I hope they\'re around for a while.\n' u"Don't let the nondescript exterior and goofy side entrance fool you the North Star restaurant serves fine microbrews and excellent creative (often veggie) cuisine. Not a college crowd here the place is just a little too spendy for the children it's a fine choice for adult dinner & conversation. \n\nAbout 8 beers on tap for about $7 a pint a mix of local NY brews and imports from California and elsewhere. Full bar too the house margarita for $8 is a solid choice. \n\nAvoid the fry basket appy for $7. The local potatoes are fried perfectly crisp generously salted and accompanied by 3 dipping sauces with garlic chipotle and basil respectively. Utterly irresistible and they will totally spoil your appetite. Don't say I didn't warn you!\n\nA daily mussel special was awesome rich wine broth and some nice bits of fennel accompanied by toasted bread $12. I had to get a spoon to finish every drop. We split a regular roast pork entree accompanied by rice and a gently spicy curry squash sauce so yummy fairly priced at $19. Alas no room for dessert. \n\nThe food definitely took a little while to come out but we were deep in conversation so I didn't really care. If you're in a hurry this might not be your place.\n\nVegetarian rating: 5 stars for the many choices. These are your people.\n\nHaven't tried their brunch.\n" u'We went here last night and enjoyedbthe pirogies (huge) and the baltimore chicken wings. We were licking our fingers! For the entrees we had the spetzel (way too tangy on the lemony side fpr my taste) and the garlic hurger. Really tasty. Why am i giving it a 4 and not a 5??? The one time i leave my ID at home i was asked for it. While i\'m flattered i clearly look my age 36!!! So there were no coxktails for me! I can\'t fault them though as they were just doing their job. The waitressed appeared to ask the younger "looking" person of the groups. Kind of sucked but lesson learned.\n' u'Had a very mediocre brunch. They were out of 3 items on their brunch menu. I had chicken and donuts. The chicken had more breading then chicken the mustard sauce was very tasty. The donuts were boring. Service was lackluster.\n' u"Lovely outdoor setting. Casual service on point not slow not overwhelming. Good coffee. Better bloody Mary's.  \n\nTofu scramble huevos rancheros totally worthwhile even if a bit of a small portion.  Chicken and donuts. Well I don't eat chicken but the donuts were from heaven. I could eat a dozen. \n\nBLT with an egg French toast and eggs with vegan sausage and rye toast. We were all very pleased and would definitely return\n" u"The neighborhood is really residential so it's great to have one of these places for the folks to enjoy a night out. Two stars for the beer selection...which included some local stuff plus Utica Club in a can (that alone is worth two stars for availability in this part of the state). The food a bit meh...I had a caesar salad that had some generic caesar dressing...added some spiedie chicken (local Binghamton twist..) but the chicken was sort of dry shoe-leathery and pretty paltry for the portion size. The staff was on the hipstery side of things with a couple with those silly pseudo lumberjack beards.mixed with Fitzy McBro and his ethnic prider cohort with the Guiness shirt. For drinks alone it's a nice little stop...\n" u'Small place with a focus on healthy fare. Having said that we were a group of 8 (stretches the place a bit) and most people got burgers. A lot of the vegetables wine etc... is locally sourced - which gives a freshness and uniqueness. So yes there are a lot of healthy options on the menu - yet... there\'s also your burgers fries beer etc... that you\'d expect. \n\nService was decent; food was above average; portion sizes were above average; atmosphere was more "quiet" than "raucous" - decent number of choices at a reasonable price.\n' u"Wow - was this place lame. We had breakfast there on a Sunday morning. Place was about half full - that should have been the first clue. We ordered the french toast some sausage eggs scrambled soft etc..... along with some coffee. French toast- despite its fancy description of being soaked overnight (which it wasn't) - was pretty generic. The soft scrambled eggs were cooked to death and so it went. The coffee was pretty crappy too. Not really a single good thing to say about this place except the parking was convenient and easy.\n" u'Northstar is a lovely little restaurant in the fall creek area. The outdoor seating is really cute and quaint. The restaurant focuses on using many local and organic ingredients which is what I love about it. The food is usually great and the drinks are strong and tasty. Definitely try the baltimore chicken wings. Soooo good! \n\nA little on the pricier side and some of the portions could be bigger (dessert was tiny) which is why I knocked off a star.\n' u"While this is generally a pleasant and friendly neighborhood bar/restaurant you have to be careful to get reasonable value in your food. My friends ordered burgers and wings that were well prepared and good-sized complete with fries but I ordered the tomato and couscous. It wasn't bad but puny uninteresting and a little greasy. It was made from about $.75 of ingredients. The tomato was breaded and fried on top of a cup and a half of couscous. The biggest problem was that this little appetizer was listed as a main entree for $18.\n" u'Thank you for capably wrangling our annoying party of fourteen people just the other night. We appreciate the excellent service and I know how challenging big groups can be. And great food as always.\n' u'It\'s hard for me to even give one star for this establishment. From the minute we walked in it eS bad. We asked to be seated outside and they said no. There were open tables and it wasn\'t busy. Then there was 6 of us seated at a table for 4. We asked for a table to be moved over and the waitress said " we don\'t normally do this". Which we thought was rude. \n\nThen comes the food. My dads burger was actually raw. He sent it back and never sends food back. It didn\'t even looked like it was cooked. My fish po boy wasn\'t even a po boy there weren\'t any pickles and the roumalade was just a tartar sauce. Then when I asked for pickles they didn\'t come for 17 minutes. \n\nThe waitress could have cared less about the raw burger. I didn\'t eat my fish it was awful. The Caesar dressing had 6 raw garlic cloves in it. The Parmesan wedges weren\'t even cooked they were hard. No one ever asked us if we needed a refill on our beers or moscow mules. Also when I asked for more roumalade they brought me a sour cream. They pride themselves on "gluten free" but we\'re out of gluten free rolls.\n\nThe potato salad made my sister sick. I would never recommend this or go here again.\n' u'Northstar is my absolute favorite restaurant in all of Ithaca. Thinking about their tofu hot wings and barbecue wings makes me salivate and their drink menu is pretty sensational. Also their beer garden is absolutely wonderful in the summer complete with a Tiki beer bar outdoor seating and a ping pong table.\n' u'I love Northstar House! The menu is broad enough that there is something for everyone. The seasonal updates keep it fresh and interesting. The Mac and Cheese is always delicious and filling; it is a go-to for me. The beer menu is also pretty great. Overall it is one of my default places because of the cozy no-nonsense atmosphere well executed fare and great beer.\n' u'Pros: Decent number of vegan options service was good food is locally sourced.\n\nCons: Food was not very good and was over-priced.  Also atmosphere isn\'t the best.\n\nMy wife and I are vegans and dined here just once.  The Northstar House definitely has potential but it needs some improvement. \n\nI had the vegan Buffalo "wings" (actually fried tofu wedges) for an appetizer.  The waitress told me that the normal dairy-based blue cheese dip would be replaced with a creamy curry sauce.  The wings arrived with a very thin coating of hot sauce - much thinner than I would have liked.  The scarcity of sauce made for unexciting bland tofu.  The curry sauce was not very good - and in any case it made for an odd and jarring combination with the Buffalo sauce.  I left most of the curry sauce unfinished.  A side of plain Veganaise would have been better (or better yet some kind of vegan version of the blue cheese dip). \n\nI had a veggie burger as my entr\xe9e.  The burger patty was crumbly and dry.  The French bread was really not the best choice for use as a "bun".  The bread was too crusty and thick and the bread-to-burger ratio was too high.  The ketchup was served on the side in a small metal cup.  I really prefer getting a bottle of ketchup since the small cups usually don\'t contain enough ketchup.  I ordered a side of mixed greens saut\xe9ed with garlic.  The side was unremarkable (and fairly small).\n\nThe waitstaff were friendly and attentive and were very knowledgeable about which items were vegan or could be veganized.  However the restaurant atmosphere left something to be desired.  It was very dark inside.  Maybe some candles on the tables would have helped.  Also the hostess wanted to seat us at a small table-for-two that was wedged between two larger tables that were already occupied by other diners.  If we had sat there we would have had very little privacy.  Luckily my wife spotted another small table near the back corner and we were able to sit there.\n\nOur dinner-for-two came to over $60 a price that I felt was too high given the quality of the food.  (For the record my wife enjoyed her dinner more than I enjoyed mine.)\n\nI think I\'m being generous with three stars and I hope that the restaurant improves over time.  I do like the fact that there are vegan options here and that much of the food is locally sourced.\n\nAlso one more thing: In viewing the other Yelp reviews I see that the owners/management rarely reply to any of the negative reviews.  I always consider such lack of replies to be a bad sign.\n' u'Came here with friends for dinner. It was busy but we got a table in 10 minutes even though they told us 30 minutes. Lots of variety of beer and food sourced from local ingredients. We all loved our food. My brisket sandwich was solid. Not from the area but if I come back I would definitely make a point to eat here.\n' u'Everything we got was amazing especially the cheesy potato hash. Quick service fresh ingredients extremely friendly staff. Definitely my new favourite brunch place!\n' u"Love this place! I've been here both with colleagues and family and have been pleased each time. The beer garden is lovely-- it was so enjoyable to hang out outdoors while watching the Olympics and then cruise to the other end of the garden to play some ping pong. The burgers are great and the beer selection is too-- you just might need to head inside if you want to take full advantage of the drink menu. Highly recommend.\n" u'GR8! Our party of 4 all had something different and thoroughly enjoyed everything! Clean plates all around. Nice beer selection and great atmosphere.  Service was splendid.\n']
100.Little Thai House,[u"Little Thai House is literally the best deal in collegetown for takeout speed & value. Sure there are slightly fewer options than apollos but the prices are lower and there's no credit card minimum. A few comments on the food:\n\n-black pepper pork chop: usually on the salty side and definitely has its fair share of bones\n-green curry beef; most of their beef dishes are made with brisket or some other cut that has a bit of connective tissue. if this is your thing it's super delicious\n-fish: never the freshest thing would recommend skipping\n-chicken dishes; most of them are some kind of diced fried chicken. The coating isn't too thick usually and is a good deal for protein\n-red curry; two issues with their curry. One the potatoes are often a little undercooked to the point of having a bit of a bite to them. Two the red thai curry chicken is often very sweet.\n" u"Every restaurants have their target groups. If you are looking for a nice fancy restaurant or want to experience a real authentic Thai food this is not a place to go to.\n\nAs a university student I think the food here has all elements of a good college students' food: cheap and fast. I got beef/tomato curry and red coconut curry with chicken. They were great. I'll definitely come back and try other menus. Nice ambiance friendly server. Overall a 4-star restaurant for college students.\n\nEdit: I went to Little Thai House for dinner a couple more times and found that the food quality was not consistent. They never served my favorite beef/tomato curry again. The red coconut curry with chicken was not as delicious as the first one I had. The potatoes were somewhat undercooked. Less meat and more vegetable hence the review readjustment to 3-star. It's still a good place for a busy college student to come for a quick dinner.\n" u"The pad thai was not very pad thai like. What should have been like a peanut butter flavor it tastes more sweet and sour to me. It was a bit disappointing. Their red curry chicken was slightly better but it still didn't taste very authentic.\n\nThe good thing about it was that the portion sizes were very large and it was at an affordable price. It's good for starving college kids on a budget.\n" u'The food here was not served on Styrofoam dishes when I went possibly because it was during the summer and business was slow.  The pad thai was reasonably priced portions were large and it was pretty good.  The service was extremely fast as well.\n' u"The food is okay but it's served on Styrofoam. \n\nCan't you splurge for paper plates? or reusable plates? The main thing though is the lady that is always at the desk just doesn't want to be bothered by people coming in and ordering food and handing her money. She too busy standing there watching tv to be distracted by customers. As a person coming in there I feel like I'm burdening her and she doesn't want us to be there.\nSo we won't.\n\nBrown rice would have been nice.\n" u"I'm not really sure why they chose to advertise themselves as a Thai restaurant. Most of the dishes at least when I went were Chinese. There were two curry items available but I wasn't really in the mood for curry (I was actually hoping to try the pad thai but it wasn't available) so I just went for the Chinese items.\n\nIt's a really cheap place to eat - for $6.25 you can get a plate of rice with two items. I went for the spicy tofu and the black pepper porch chops. Food wasn't bad either but the sauce from both items together on the plate mixed together and formed a little pool which drenched all my rice.\n\nIt's also really fast and perhaps would be good for takeout. Maybe I'll drop by more often to get quick lunch between classes since it's so close to the engineering quad.\n" u'Can you go below one star? \n\nThe pad thai tastes very similar to what I imagine cow cud tastes like. The chicken thing I ate probably was never a mammal.\n' u'Food is bad compared to the Thai in town but it was palatable enough. I tried the pad thai and chicken red curry the pad thai was the better of the two options. The curry was pretty horrible especially the potatoes. \n\nAnyways the reason I gave it 4 stars is the price. Even though the food is not special you can get a whole lot of food for $6.25.\n' u'Inexpensive. Only 3 options for vegetarians.  No menu only set options. Terrible service.\n' u"Not bad for the price.\n\nI went in to pick up take out for lunch. You walk up to the little food counter and tell the lady which sides you want and you'll be out of there in no time! I went ahead and got 3 sides for $7.75 (they also offer 2 sides for $6.75) and got the spicy tofu red chicken curry and the pad thai. The curry was pretty bad though I'll admit I've never had Thai curry before so it might just not be my thing. The tofu was okay though a bit saucy. The pad thai was tasty but I don't think it contained anything but noodles bamboo and the occasional bit of scrambled egg and onion. \n\nOverall I'll give them a 5 for convenience a 3 for the food and a 3 for the price (not worse or better than the options in Collegetown). Would probably not go back unless I felt adventurous and Apollo was too packed. You get exactly what you pay for don't expect authentic Thai / Chinese food for something so quick and cheap.\n" u'In my department us graduate students jokingly refer to this place as "Depressing Little Thai Hose" or "Little Depressing Thai House." Whatever you call it eating this cheap low quality heating bin Thai food is depressing. It reminds us of the fact that we have little to spend and not much time to eat before we hobble back to our offices/labs at Cornell to continue our work. This food is down right bad thai food but it serves its purpose filling the stomachs of poor students as quickly as possible at a price they can afford.\n\nBad Thai food is still reasonably tasty compared to other poorly executed cuisines so as bad as this place is it\'s kind of good in a raunchy sort of way and the renovations do look nice (unfortunately there were no renovations made to their recipes). For how bad this place is I still go back quite frequently. I think I\'m probably addicted to the sugar in their food and the low price.\n\nThe spicy basil chicken is decent and I almost always get the Pad Thai here but this is not to say its any good I just like noodles. All the curry dishes are watery and bland. Some of them literally taste like a mixture of water coconut milk and salt. I\'m not sure what makes them green red or yellow but whatever it is it is not contributing anything to the flavor. \n\nThey no longer have peanuts to add to your dish the prices are no longer less than the Chinese place down the street and the service can be pretty bad.\n' u"Cheap and delicious - the best combination in my book. For $6.95 you get an entire bowl/carton of rice and your choice of 1 or 2 entrees they have and for an extra dollar you can get 3 entrees. (It all comes out to be the same size though it's just a difference in the variety of food) \n\nSome of their dishes ARE chinese like their beef and broccoli and eggplant with tofu but the other ones are typically thai like yellow curry chicken and pad thai. Everything I've tried is is almost always on point (sometimes the meat can be bland but for $7 I won't complain) and I usually like to vary in what I choose as my entrees each time I come in. Although I've never gotten their beef and broccoli (too safe and familiar) or their pad thai (it looks a little sad and limp everytime I go in). \n\nAlso I love their coconut rolls which although a little pricier than I'd like (the lady behind the counter literally just walks over to the fridge and takes out 1 roll from probably a less than $10 bag full of a 100 rolls and brings it into the kitchen and puts it into the fryer and charges me $1.50 for the one roll) is still great to try if you happen to stop by. The basal rolls are also good but not my favorite. You need the side sauce to make it taste good which is a marker of not the best food for me.\n\nYou can sit down or take it to go and there's no need to tip if you stay. Just clean up after yourself and leave. It's cheap easy and convenient and they can definitely count me as a faithful customer for as long as I'm a college student.\n" u"Yum!\n\nThis place is quick and cheap. You walk in and get rice in a small or big container and add one two three etc. items on top. I really liked their spicy soft tofu. There's also a table in the back where you can get utensils and sriracha. You can totally steal some sriracha here. Just put a bunch in a cup and walk out. We're college students! SAVE MONEY.\n" u"Little Thai House gets 500 stars from me.  \n\nOk... so maybe some of that is nostalgia.  But I went back this weekend after 6 years full of trepidation that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered now that I've eaten at many many Thai places - and it did not fail to deliver.  Still my favorite Thai food ever.  Somehow Ithaca (here and Thai Cuisine as well) knows how to make pad thai better than anywhere else I've been.  I always get 2 items pad thai and yellow curry and they are both crazy delicious.  I could eat them every week (and used to when I lived here :) ).  The prices are extremely reasonable for a HUGE amount of food.  \n\nI wish they still had the crushed peanuts but that's minor.\n\nMy only complaint - Ithaca and Little Thai House are 6 hours away from me!!!\n" u'This is the only place in Collegetown that is actually WORSE than Subway. Yeah i said it and yeah you best believe it. You think the thought of eating subway can make you dry heave and gag uncontrollably? The pain from the Thai House can be equated to the feeling of a post-colonoscopy surgery done by a hydrofracking drill.\n\nPrice is around $7-8 this makes it competitive with other fast foods in ctown but this is where it ends.\n\nThe food cannot even be considered food. It is called little "Thai" house first of all its not Thai food. Its Chinese food. Actually being Chinese that insults the hell out of me cuz this sorry excuse for food is a disgrace to all cultures. Second the food looks like its been oxidized since the beginning of time and tastes as if its gone through someones digestive system already. The veges bok choy and broccoli in particular are not even green. They are brown. What other situation do you get brown veges? Your own feces. So go eat that instead since its free. Third this food is greasier than than the hairdo of a 1950\'s American gangster. One bite into your broccoli you can already feel your arteries clogging. Fourth the tables are so filthy and unwashed that you will actually stick to the table once you put your arm down. Hmm must be a new strategy to retain customers literally. Fifth to the crazy people who say this place is not crowded... this place isn\'t crowded because no sane individual would eat this. \n\nIf you want Chinese food go to Hai Hong or to some other city.\n\nEdit 1/28/2013: It seems they have renovated the interior with new tables and flooring to make it look nicer than the other 3 restaurants they own down Dryden but don\'t let this deceive you!\n' u'I went there only once because you had only limited choices of cuisines. Too sweet and too strong. You could choose 2 or 3 items but it would be ended up like three exactly the same thing!\n' u"Don't eat here. My friend saw the cashier drop coins into the food pick the coins out and leave the food out for consumption.\n\nI think this place is owned by the same people who run Asian noodle house where I found a rusty staple in a noodle dish.\n" u"Cheapest most unpretentious eats in Collegetown. It's not the most sophisticated fare--in fact it's greasy as hell and likely to make your stomach feel a little funky after a full plate--but it gets big props for being quiet cheap and fast. \n\nIf Green Cafe is the flashy douchebag of collegetown restaurants and CTB is the popular one voted most likely to succeed then Little Thai House is the very decent but slightly awkward wallflower whose parents do all his shopping at Kmart.\n" u'My favorite place in Ithaca! It is everything I love in the world: a lot of food ready instantly DELICIOUS thai food CHEAP never crowded. \n\nI recommend the yellow curry with tofu and pad thai. If you are very hungry go for the 2 entrees - it is $5.75 and it will last you 2 meals (maybe - but the pad thai is so good it is hard to save any.) \n\nI go here after every exam major study week or any time when I feel like I need a treat. \n\nYUM.\n' u'This place makes me feel like I\'m having lunch in Asia. Why don\'t more restaurants do this? I love the simplicity and the straightforwardness of the cafeteria-style service without the utter grossness and sickness of a buffet. You go in you name your size (number of dishes you want on your plate) and you pay take a cup of water and some sauces then you go and eat and you bus your table and you\'re out in 20 minutes. BAM! \nThe food selections change infrequently so that\'s kind of boring but comforting and  they are hot and good. The kitchen is shared with the sit-down restaurant next door (and the one next door to that and to that etc.)\nThe ambiance is nothing to speak of but it is real. Give to the March of Dimes while you\'re there the display is practically the sole "decoration". \nThe service is amazing if you want to get your food and be left alone. All that and not unfriendly like it is at some Thai restaurants in this town. Try it.\n']
45.Red‚Äôs Place,[u"Fantastic casual and very pleasant dining experience.\n\nOverall excellent service and food.\n\nLove the pub feel with unique menu items that stand apart from traditional bars/pub restaurants.\n\nWe ordered the crab cake sandwich and Mahi fish sandwich both accompanied by crispy sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious fairly priced and had great flavor. Hard to achieve on sandwiches sometimes!\n\nI'm a sucker for a diverse selection of seasonal local beers and was not disappointed in this department either!\n\nOur server was wonderful attentive but not pushy and just overall very friendly and thoughtful.\n\nWas a great stop for our visit to Ithaca and highly recommend!\n" u"We were in town for a short visit and stumbled upon this place while we were walking around Ithaca Commons. There were pricier restaurants around that we considered but ultimately decided to try Red's. What a pleasant surprise! I had the Crabby Pattie with waffle sweet potato fries and hubby had the Shamrockin' Madness Special burger. Both burgers were DELICIOUS and the sweet potato fries were perfection. Everyone should have them. We also ordered the Green Tea Cr\xe8me Brule\xe9 (a St. Paddy's special I believe) which we devoured. The flavor was mild unusual and satisfying. Our waiter was friendly gave us just the right recommendations and time to consider. I highly recommend Red's. It's been our best food choice yet in Ithaca!\n" u'Delicious burger with great juicy flavor. Why the 3 stars price and lack of variety. Menu was limited and the beer selection was IPA heaven and expensive for 12 oz pours draft.\n' u'So it was pretty good.  They had a burger with peanut butter and jelly.  The menu said "trust us" so I did.  Well the burger was good but not great. it could have been great... had it not had pb and j and rather ketchup and mustard.  Oh well.  I finished it up and enjoyed it it certainly was not gross as the burger was cooked well.  The bun was a little cheap for a $14 burger.\n3 stars\n\nTatter tots were 5 stars.\n\nService was 5 stars.\n\nThey had all sorts of fancy and pricier beers on tap would have appreciated one cheap beer to go with all the IPAs and so on.  4 Stars\n\nPrices were about $3 to high.  3 Stars.\n\nSo overall that is a sold 4 stars.   Think I will go back and try something different to eat next time.\n' u"Love Red's! Everyone who works here is so friendly and the menu is amazing! So many creative twists on classic menu items. \n\n...love the French onion soup bowls!\n" u'So good! The tater tots are amazing. Perfectly fried. Really tasty bar food. Not fancy but delicious!\n' u'Place is hit or miss we really enjoyed our second time here. The bartender was great and the food was great.\n' u"Wow we actually loved this place. Tristan and I were seriously starving and we came in on a busy weekend night before the rush though (no wait- thank god)! After we sat the wait went up to 50 mins insane! \n\nService was pretty slow cause of the busyness but the waiter was attentive and very nice with whatever we needed. I ordered the chicken pesto broccoli sandwich with a side salad. It was amazing! So delicious and the apple cider dressing on my salad was so savory. Tris ordered the aurora street burger and steak fries. He loved both and said the fries were amazing.\n\nWe left some room for dessert and he got smores while I opted for the donut with purity ice cream. Both were so sweet and great just different flavors. the donut was freshly fried and warm and the ice cream melted perfectly. It's raspberry drizzle added the right tough. Tristan liked how his brownie chunks melted into the graham crackers. \n\naffordable and yummy dining experience in downtown\n" u"I love how Yelp! keeps on coming through in the clutch! I was trying to pick a cool place for a welcome dinner for my fellow summer Nepali language classmates and decided to go with Red's Place simply based on Yelp reviews. What a great call! The food was wonderful and the service excellent. I strongly recommend the Philly sandwich flatbread pizzas and sweet potato fries. All my friends enjoyed their food and this is one of the best places to sit outside and eat on these humid Ithaca evenings.\n" u'Good food but the worst beer prices in ithaca... $8.00 a pint for average microbrews?\n' u'Had a great meal here. Enjoyed a mushroom burger with some tasty waffle fries. Really interesting beers available-found a new favorite!\n' u"Nice mixed concept with a decent rotating beer tap. The food is upscale burgers salads and flatbread with other items such as tacos and wings. I ordered the ginger stuffed salad with mahi mahi. The fish was cooked nicely but the salad was mostly just a half head of lettuce with a few veggies and some apples. I'll come back to try the burger or\n" u"Great burgers. If they have the chorizo burger special get it. (Note to Red's: add it to the regular menu. Why all burgers aren't half chorizo I now have no idea. It changed my life.) I was happy to get food with some flavor in Ithaca - they actually season the meat here! Plus loaded tater tots. You can never go wrong with those.\n" u'This place was such a wonderful surprise. Incredible food! We split the pomegranate kale salad and just veggie pizza and they were both outstanding!\n' u"I don't know how on earth this place only has 3.5 stars... It's amazing! One of the best burgers I've ever had and nothing was too expensive. They have great service an extensive menu of drinks and food and the overall atmosphere of the place is fantastic! I look forward to eating here again.\n" u"I'm so sick of trying to eat here. Every time we come they are out of half of the items we try to order. They never cook the burger the way I order it. It's been problem after problem and we keep coming back because the menu is great and the atmosphere is fantastic. Today was the last straw though. Not gonna bother anymore. Bye for good red's.\n" u"We stopped by Red's Place because they had outdoor seating and were pet friendly.\nWe will definitely be back because the food we had was fresh and delicious!!\nWe had the flatbreads and they were excellent!!\nOur server was very friendly and was very attentive to our needs!!\nA+++\n" u"I don't have a negative thing to say. Everything was wonderful. We had shrimp appetizer burger and fish tacos along with beer cocktails and dessert. Everything was spot on! Great friendly service and worth every penny spent. Highly recommend this spot.\n" u"I went to Red's Place for brunch and got the blackberry French toast and home fries. The home fries were pretty good but I'm a snob when it comes to my fried potatoes (though I'll basically eat any fried potato you put in front of me) and these were definitely not the best. They had good flavor but they were not crispy enough on the outside. The French toast was simply OK. The blackberry sauce was great and I wish it had more but the cream that was on top was too sweet and the French toast was not the correct texture. If I'm going to waste my calories on a sweet breakfast it better be damn good. This was not. It wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't up there with some of the other brunches I've had in Ithaca.\n" u'Visiting Ithaca on vacation and happened upon this place. Great burgers and atmosphere.\n']
49.Ciao Wood-Fired Pizza & Pasta,[u"Good portion sizes and lively atmosphere. Come here hungry! Out of four orders my selection was the tastiest: sausage with roasted red pepper pasta.\n\nAlso the location of this restaurant is sufficiently far away from Cornell and Ithaca College so it's a good escape from pesky students.\n" u'I have been to Ciao a lot.  My kid is in love with the Margherita pizza and we go to the movies at least once a month so we end up here more often than not.  Initial visits were pretty much a-ok in my book (a three star rating according to Yelp) but my last three visits have been disappointing.  Sysco products seem to be pretty prominent in lieu of more fresh ingredients.  Soup should be homemade instead of opting for tinny-tasting thick canned soup.  Salads should be made fresh the day of.  Not served the day after.  These are experiences we have had over the last six months.  Last week I took my son to lunch there before (yet another) movie (sidenote:  Have you seen Beauty & The Beast?  No?  It\'s $!?#ing amazing   regardless of what you thought it might be) and while we were seated immediately we waited almost an hour for his pizza and my salad while the two tables on either side of us (who arrived after us) both ordered received and completed their meals.  Our waitress never came to explain the delay or see if we needed anything else.  In fact we hardly saw her at all to even ask her.  When our lunch was finally delivered she only said "sorry it took so long everyone wanted the Panzanella Salad."  Is this an explanation?  I don\'t think so.  \n\nThe food.  I want to say I have had good meals here in the past. If you order any appetizer I\'d go with the arancini and the eggplant fries.  Neither have ever failed me.  Delicious!  For entrees I\'ve had the gnocchi pomodoro more than once and had no complaints at the time.  I\'ve had the Salmon San Remo twice.  Delicious grilled salmon but a big fail in taste on those tuscan potatoes.  Just weird all the way around.  The pizza:  take into consideration I have a near teenager who could be served tomato paste spread on toast and he would say it\'s great pizza.  I find Ciao\'s to be pretty mediocre but haven\'t ever had more than a small piece or two of the Margherita so I don\'t feel I can judge it fairly. My son loves it and says it\'s second to NY Pizzeria in Trumansburg.  I can however judge the crap out of that Panzanella & Chicken Salad I ordered last week.  Soggy limp arugula.  "Fresh" mozzarella that is clearly not fresh - hard bland-tasting mozzarella. I was able to locate three capers.  Chicken?  Perfectly cooked.  So thanks for that.  The thing that bothered me the most was the handful of dry ciabatta bread that was thrown on top.  Dry crumbly ciabatta bread does not belong in a proper panzanella.  Grilled day-old italian bread that has been drizzled with olive oil however does belong in a proper panzanella. \n\nI want to reiterate we have had good meals good drinks and good service IN THE PAST at Ciao.  Something appears to be missing as of late though as I feel the quality of the food as well as the service has gone downhill.  For now I\'ll be looking for other dining options on the hill when we visit.\n' u'First night in Ithaca and Ciao delivered -- great atmosphere yummy pasta dishes and dessert!\n' u"Recommended by Marriott Courtyard; did trip advisor review to validate - spot on. There was a wait but it didn't take too long to get a table; served heavy 9oz glass of wine (12.00 so slightly pricey on wine). Meals were all excellent - pizza delicious calamari on pizza dough good (but more lettuce than calamari by far) ordered linquine shrimp dish and chicken parm that was so large it was a meal the next day. Service attentive and friendly. Would be #1 place I'd recommend out of our weekend experience of dining\n" u'The anancini is so cheesy and succulent the included sauces really make it pop. The woodfire pizzas remind me of my travels to Italy.  I have been here twice and love it! I need to venture out and try more but the pizza and arancini keep calling my name!!! I can only imagine how good other offerings taste!\n' u'I keep trying to give this place a chance but every time I have been here it gets worse. It is clear that each visit shows how the owners are only focused on reducing costs. The service continues to go downhill.  We had one server for over twenty four guests spread amongst three tables. I always had to ask for new drinks when the food was delivered none of the food runners had any clue where the entrees were supposed to go. Two of the meals had to be sent back as they were wrong. The food is another disappointing factor of the experience at ciao. There is a complete lack of quality in terms of ingredients. Several items appeared to be frozen processed products. The toppings on the pizza specifically the "peppers" (which were only green peppers) and the mushrooms blatantly came from a can. Extremely disappointing time and time again.\n' u"It was very busy on a Saturday night but we were able to be seated very quickly. Service was pretty good the waiter who brought us the check was not the same as the one who took our order not sure what that was about. But the food was great! The pear gorgonzola pizza was delicious and I'll be thinking about it for a while.\n" u'My husband I stopped in for lunch and were greeted and seated promptly.  The waitress was extremely good checked on us and refilled drinks quickly.  The food honestly was average. The grilled salmon was extremely good but the salad was average and topped with what seemed to be  canned tomatoes.  I had a Margherita Pizza of which the crust was perfectly cooked but again topped with canned tomatoes not sliced fresh tomatoes.  A bit disappointed but would stop for lunch to give them one more try as service was good.\n' u'Went for lunch and split the pesto pasta and Palmero pizza.  Pizza was average.  Flavor was average.  Thought being wood fire it would have more flavor.  Pesto on the other hand was very good and the portion size was very large.  Inside was very nice with a lot of booth seating.  Service was friendly and good.\n' u"This restaurant was recommended by several people so we had our first meal (lunch) there recently.  My wife had the eggplant Parmesan.  She said the eggplant was superbly prepared but wasn't fond of the sauce.  I tasted it and agreed that it tasted like tomato soup. Good but not what you would expect.  I had grilled chicken breast with fresh spinach and roasted potatoes.  It also came with a salad.  Very generous portions especially for lunch.  The chicken was cooked just right and the potatoes were excellent.  The bill for the two of us including a beverage was $24 but we each had plenty to take home for dinner.  Our service was also very good.  We will definitely go there again.\n" u"I was visiting Ithaca and wanted pizza so obviously I whipped out my Yelp app and found Ciao. I was in a state of post- movie hunger. When we got there it was very crowded because it was a Saturday night but because I was in a group of two they were able to seat us right away at the pizza bar. The inside kind of reminds me of a Carrabba's or a generic chain Italian restaurant with a pizza bar and booth tables. It seemed like the kind of place that would be good to go with your family. It was also very clean. I was impressed with their selection of pizzas though and even noticed that they had homemade gnocchi. We ordered and shared the Quatro Fromaggi pizza which was definitely enough for two people. They brought out bread before which was pretty good. When the pizza came it had a nice thin crust and a delicious garlicky and cheesy flavor. It seemed like a solid option for a restaurant right next to a mall and I would probably return for the pretty good pizza which is definitely an upgrade from your regular pizza shop.\n" u'This is not wood fired pizza. This is the next-gen of pizza hut on a gas fired look- a- like. Pizza was served on a plastic tray designed to elevate a mediocre pie and make it look "stand- up". Pie was flavorless box like. No tradition here. No crisp no char no flavor. Wait staff was hurried non- elegant and unpersonable. This pie is not "to die for" and not "memorable". Trying to be what Bertucies used to be.\n' u'Foods:\nOrdered their pizza and pasta dish. \nThey were nothing spectacular just so so.\n\nAmbience:\n- a little too loud: the conversations are audible all around.\n- lighting is on the darker side.\n\nService: failed\n- server by the name of Jennifer M. came by 30 seconds after I sat down and asked what drinks I wanted. Truthfully I haven\'t got the time to think about what I wanted to drink yet. So I told her I needed a couple of minutes. She looked at me and walked away without a word. That was odd. I going to give her the benefit of doubt. May be she was having a bad day.\n- a few minutes later she sailed in with 2 glasses of water and almost smashed the first glass right in front of me when the bottom of the glass hit the marble top of the table with an incredible rude crash. She said "excuse me". The damage was already done I cannot see how the apology can help because it took away a lot of the pleasure of dining out right there. Crashing a glass of water 6 inches away from the guest is one of those things like accidentally kicking the chair of the guest when the server walks by is one of the most annoying thing that a server can commit towards a guest. It\'s like a service industry crime. It completely devastates the dining experience.\n\nWould I return? I would have to be starving for food and all restaurants in Ithaca have closed.\nNope not a pleasant place to dine. Sorry two down it\'s hard to recover from there.\n' u"Ciao makes much of its wood-fired ovens and the char on the bottom of the pizza.  If you like that kind of pizza as I do this is a big selling point.  You want one of those thin and crispy pizzas that you can find only in New Haven or New York or perhaps in a Grimaldi's somewhere in the country.\n\nUnfortunately the pizza does not deliver on the promise. It is decent enough but just average.  It could be a bit thinner and does not have any char at least the one I had.  It was all right but nothing I could not have found in many pizzerias in New York State.\n\nThe other food like the salad lasagna and calzones that my friends had all looked good and they all enjoyed the food.  The pasta fagiole was pretty flavorful as well.  \n\nAll in all the food is good but the pizza fails to blow me away.  I wouldn't object to going again but would probably search for another restaurant the next time in Ithaca.\n" u"I loved ciao! What a great little place located just north of downtown ithaca.\n\nThe food and ambiance here is fantastic! For an appetizer we ordered stuffed hot peppers which where awesome however I wish they gave you more than 2 of them for $6.00! For dinner we had the Tuscan sacchetti and the chicken pazzo pizza. The sacchetti was creamy and tasted amazing! We absolutely loved the dish! The pizza was great as well fresh toppings great tasting chicken and the dough was cooked perfect just as Woodfired pizza should taste like! I heard complaints about burnt pizza? Hmmm I'm not sure if people realize that's what Woodfired pizza is a pizza cooked on an open flame so of course your going to get dark spots! If you don't like this style don't order it!\n\nI'll definitely be back here! This is a perfect dinner after the beer and wine stops!\n" u'This would be four stars but the attention to detail by the servers hosts and bartender is deplorable. Wine is not NY even though this is wine country and it came with far too resinous. Note to bartender: if you see chunks of grape coming out of bottle do not hand it to the server.\n' u'The pizza here is good. Not great but good. The crust is crisp and toppings flavorful but nothing outrageously amazing. Service was slow. We sat for almost 10 minutes before being greeted by our server while being smiled at by other servers and the hostess. Ciao needs to step up its service.\n' u"We were in the area on vacation and wanted a local type place so we were a little let down that this is somewhat chain-y but it's more our fault though for not researching more I guess. The Caesar salad was very good! We got the four cheese pizza and it was tasty enough. It was a little on the dry side. They didn't have ranch either. Overall it was just an average experience.\n" u"We arrived in Ithaca late and we're tired and hungry after a long day of travel. We made our selection based on Yelp reviews. Dinner was wonderful! Brandon was extremely helpful in his dinner suggestions. My husband's Chicken Parm was huge and delicious. I had the Maragheritta Pizza and it was Devine! Fresh mozzarella and chunky tomato sauce made it perfect! \nGreat choice!\n" u"Solid pizza-pasta joint in North Ithaca. We came to carbo-load for the Ithaca Half marathon and Ciao delivered the good. The space was clean and modern. Our server was a bit green but very friendly and up to the task. Prices are affordable compared to the other quality Italian restaurants around town. The pasta was generously portioned and tasty. Good place if you live in the area. Didn't try the pizza but it looks good.\n"]

103.CoreLife Eatery,[]
54.Lincoln Street Diner,[u'I really like having the Bickering Twins Tuesday night dinners happen at the diner. It is great to have the diner used at night. I really appreciate the vegetarian options.\n' u'Small not well maintained. Slow turnover on tables and food service. Food was plain and boring. If you like college kids and want to see them hang out - go here\n' u'Great little diner.\nService prompt\nBreakfast hot and very good sausage gravy\nFriendly place\n' u"Good food but man did we get sick afterwards. Both my husband and I were in the toilet within 30 minutes of eating. Don't think it was bad food just so greasy. We're very healthy eaters normally. Great service. Good ole greasy spoon quality food.\n" u'Lovely diner awesome food and the best service ever... Stopped by on a lazy afternoon for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed the food...\n\nThe folks here were super friendly and offered us some great tips for places to go to I the vicinity...\n' u'This is a "hole in the wall" very small idiosyncratic diner.\n\nWe live on the outskirts of Ithaca so we don\'t get in here very regularly but when we do we\'ve never had a bad experience. \n\nThe kids and whole family enjoy the old-timey locally-run dive atmosphere. \n\nThe food is cheap and adequate and some of the items are truly yummy.\n\nThe staff always seems friendly and down-to-earth. One of the regular waitresses is sometimes a bit "brusque" but I think she means well.\n\nThey have some weird rules about when they serve certain foods because of the way they manage their griddle. Also no tipping with cash and a minimum $10 tab to use a credit card.\n\nI give this place 5 stars because it is a local very small business seemingly doing right by their customers.\n' u"Came here with family while we were camping and WOW! We all ordered the ziffy omelet...3 of us got it with sausage gravy. This was hands down the best omelet I've ever had! I highly recommend it with the sausage gravy.  The staff was also very friendly and made us feel welcome.\n" u"Only thing good about this place was the coffee and the nice guy that served the coffee who wasn't even supposed to. Our waitress saw us sit down looked us straight in the eyes a million times when we were ready to order and decided to just ignore us for 15-20 minutes and serve the people she already knew in town who came in after us. \n\nBut even with bad service usually the food makes up for it. Not here.\n\nIf you're looking for a traditional diner especially if you're visiting from Jersey you'll be extremely disappointed. Never knew someone could mess up a simple omelette and home fries but this place did. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.\n" u"I am not sure where did all this angry reviews come from but this is the best place in Ithaca you can get breakfast and brunch. Where else could you go in this middle of no where. This is a small restaurant. You can't expect them to react instantly when it's full of people. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch. Great food great price and nice people.\n" u"Cheap yes so just go with that thought and you'll be happy.  I visited on a Tuesday morning the cook maybe manager commented a few times to various folks that they were slammed.  There was no wait but certainly a steady stream of folks. The servers were friendly and attentive. \n\nI really wanted to try the sausage gravy n biscuits.  Today's special was sausage gravy over a corn muffin and potatoes.  Weird maybe it was a no biscuit day? I acquiesced it was a good consistency  good amount of sausage and a good sized plate of food.  I'd happily pay a few more dollars for crisp tatoes  a biscuit some seasoning (other than salt) in the gravy (after the photo I added a fair amount of pepper and some ketchup and some red hot). The potatoes on the grill top were occasionally blessed with bacon drippings and they had a paprika hue but the soft nubs still lacked flavor.\n" u"Small place but we were still able to get a seat without a problem. Nice people and great cheap food. I only wish I got scrambled eggs on my egg sandwich but that's my problem not theirs. They ring you up at the counter but don't give you a receipt so tipping is something you'll have to figure out on your own.\n" u"This is the sort of small old time timey place with interesting food like you see on Diners Driveins and Dives.  The decor is decidedly out of date on purpose.  It's still the 1970s in there.  It gets super busy on Saturdays. \nThe best dishes are:\nSaturday Cajun sausage gravy. \nWednesday turkey dinner. \nFriday mac and cheese.  Or blackened grilled haddock.  \nAny day has the best bacon and eggs anywhere.  Cheap too.  \nEverything is very inexpensive.\n" u'Just in town for a wedding and needed a place to grab some breakfast. This is a great diner! Friendly staff good food reasonable prices. Highly recommend!\n' u"Cajun sausage gravy over homefries and biscuits is the king of all breakfasts. Probably the king of all meals. I am vegetarian but I make an exception for Lincoln St. Diner's gravy.\nAtmosphere is a major contributor to the experience.\n" u"Food was good service was reasonable parking was relatively easy but unfortunately this place gave me stomach issues. \n\nSORRY for the TMI but I liken it to my first year at college where I had constant stomach issues due to getting used to whatever they cooked the food with.\n\nSo no I won't be going back.\n" u"It's because of this place that I now always try to do my laundry on Saturday mornings at Fall Creek Laundromat because I can just go next door and get a great breakfast while waiting for my clothes to wash.\n\nThey are famous for their Saturday morning special the Cajun sausage gravy over biscuits. Simply put it lives up to the hype. You get some cheddar biscuits and some potatoes completely smothered with their amazing gravy with chunks of sausages mixed into it. It's a bit spicy but not overwhelming. Shameless individuals would probably lick their plates clean. Not only that but it comes out to around $6.\n\nThe earlier you get there the better. I once tried going in around 1 and the place was packed with a short line which would have prevented me from being seated before the place closed at 2. I heard they run out of certain items by then anyway. I always go around 9-10 though and seating is easy then.\n\nThe staff is very familiar with the local neighbors and you'll see them joke around with those people a lot. They're pretty nice and attentive to all the other guests as well so you'll have an enjoyable experience here with them.\n" u"Good eggs and Good coffee at a decent price.  What more can you want?  We had the ZIppy's Omelette.  which comes with eggs bacon ham and cheese all wrapped up int the Omelette.  It was quite decent.  The only thing I would say that's negative is the guy at the grill has a very small grill so if it gets busy be prepared to wait for a bit for your order.  Other than that I have no complaints.  The coffee was delicious and the servers were very good.\n" u"The worst place ever! Don't go there. Don't ever go there. Freaking rude people. No service at all. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came over. And they saw us sitting there. It was my husband's birthday and they ruined it perfectly.\n" u"A 5-minute walk from Ithaca Falls Natural Area so anyone who's visiting the falls should definitely go here. I got the All Star breakfast which was so satisfying especially after a long jog from Collegetown. It had bacon ham egg sausage and cheese on a toasted bagel with potatoes on the side. The bagel was excellent; it was crispy and chewy in the same bite which is exactly how I like it. They have daily special menus too which sound really appetizing.\n" u"Good blueberry pancakes but terrible coffee. I know that this is a locals only place but it would have been great if they made it very clear somehow that you could only tip in cash. Thankfully I had enough cash to tip after I paid with my card but I would have felt terrible if I didn't have cash.\n"]
105.Mitsuba,[u'I ordered the Eel Maki roll which was lovely. Also the sushi that comes free with dinner is delicious. I ordered the salmon teriyaki. The flavors were really nice but I was surprised at the total lack of vegetables. There is a salad bar which comes with dinner.  my husband had the Nigiri and Maki entr\xe9e he says that was good. Our dining companions always get the hibachi and they love it. Ambience is nice. Service was sparse we rarely saw our server water glasses were never refilled and they let us sit for over half an hour waiting for check. Otherwise a nice experience\n' u"I ordered take out and It was decent sushi however I wasn't overly impressed. It was a Sunday night though so I'll probably try it out again at least one more time before making my final judgement. I'd recommend not ordering when it gets closer to closibg especially on an off night.\n" u"Acceptable sushi but nothing outstanding.  I've been to different Mitsuba franchise locations and this was the least impressive by a long shot.\n" u'This was your average sushi restaurant but the Chinese menu was pretty authentic in all Chinese. Some offerings included sweet and spicy frog etc. the sushi was just ok though lots of tempora and immitation crab.\n' u"I have no issues with the food. The sushi was good the other dishes as well. I am a local resident who frequented the same location under previous owners as well as other Japanese restaurants in town. I don't enjoy giving a bad review but hope it is used to improve. The food is 3-4 stars. The service and atmosphere are 1 star. I don't think it is an attitude of the staff it appears they have had zero training:\n\nService.  Not busy. Party of four table settings for two. Two more table settings were not brought until we asked for them when the food arrived. Appetizers delivered...  No small plates brought. After 3-4 minutes I had to ask. Dishes not cleared soup/salad/appetizer. Although we plainly stacked them at the edge to make room they repeatedly failed to clear them even after serving more food! I had to ask both times.  No tea or water refills.\n\nAtmosphere: Very loud phone ringing several times echos throughout the place. Loud yelling conversations from front desk to chef or others. An employee sleeping laying flat out at the table right next to the salad bar. His feet literally 5 feet away from you as you are getting a salad.\n" u'I want to start off with saying it hurts me to give this restaurant a low score. I was traveling to Ithaca for a one day trip. I\'ve done a bit of research and wanted to find the best sushi Ithaca has to offer and found this place. Having coming in around 4pm on a Friday there was only a few tables seated inside. \nAs I sat down I\'ve noticed there was a 2nd menu which was filled with Chinese dishes. On the menu it literally says "Mitsuba Japanese Cuisine." First impressions was confusion with a Chinese menu and Thai dishes such as the Tom Yum Soup for example. Another observation was the drink/dessert menus weren\'t wiped down and literally had dried soy sauce spots on them. \nAs I\'m looking through the Japanese menu I was searching for the a la carte section (Nigiri). I was told it was on the take-out menu so here comes a 3rd menu if I wanted Nigiri. There are a couple errors on the take-out menu such as "Salmon" being spelled "Sakmon." Also it states on the take-out menu that Happy Hour is 3:00pm - 5:30pm but on the plastic stand that sits on the table it states 3:30pm - 6:00pm. I also want to point out there is literally a picture of a hibachi table on the menu. There isn\'t a single actual hibachi table inside the restaurant. \nA complimentary volcano roll was given to us which was 3 pieces and mainly rice. Suspicions rose and I asked what the volcano roll was filled with and I was told "white fish." A very unnoticeable amount of "white fish" was found inside the roll and it only tasted of deep fried rice. Though complimentary I could have done without.  \nSo I wanted to start off with the Shumai and Gyoza. The Shumai came out barely lukewarm and came with an overly strong sauce. I\'m not shy of strong sauces but this will hit your sinuses and make you lightheaded. The Gyoza was actually quite tasty. The filling was tender and the was nicely done. \nI then ordered Nigiri which consisted of Scallop Super-White Tuna Yellow-Tail Salmon Tuna Mackerel Sweet Shrimp and Ikura (Salmon Roe). I think the Yellow-Tail Super-White Tuna and Scallop were the highlights. The Tuna was just alright. The Salmon was odd to me. It looked fresh in colour but tasted off. The Mackerel and Ikura had to be the biggest disappointment. The colour of the Mackerel was off and very dry. The Ikura is the worst I\'ve had. Old Ikura is what I had. To the point where the shell or skin of each roe would literally stick to the inside of your teeth. As for the Sweet Shrimp didn\'t taste quite fresh. \nOnto the rolls. I ordered the Mitsuba Lobster Crazy Eel and Paradise. What really gets me is the menu is loaded with pictures left and right. Beautiful professional looking pictures of the rolls and how they\'re plated. None of the rolls were presented the way it looked in the pictures. \nI must say once the Paradise Roll and Nigiri came out my mind was blown. I was astonished seeing how this was plated. It looked incredible and I absolutely loved it. Seeing the effect on the plate really blew me away. But unfortunately came with a price. I noticed a thin strand growing out of the middle of the plastic flower. At first I was really hoping it was a fiber from one of the petals but I was wrong. Not only was it a dark colour but it was without a doubt a hair. As I started to pull it out it kept getting longer and longer to the point where I actually pulled the plastic flower out of the cup hanging by the hair. I called the Host over and showed him and he apologized and took away the flower. The Crazy Eel and Mitsuba Lobster Roll came out and they were tasty and I have no complaints. \nAfter the meal he came over and asked if we wanted dessert and we declined. He brought over the bill and told me he took off 10% for what has happened. \nFrom being confused entering a Japanese Cuisine restaurant with a Chinese menu and Thai dishes to dirty menus to a hair being dead center of the plate. I\'m very saddened to give this restaurant such a low score because I see potential. The presentation is phenomenal and I truly feel the chef is creative and skillful making sushi. Unfortunately the best way I can describe this restaurant is it\'s a beautiful car with a bad engine. The engine needs some tweaking and this would be a great restaurant. \n\n---Food---\n*NIGIRI*\nScallop: 8.5/10\nSuper-White Tuna: 9/10\nYellow-Tail: 8.5/10\nSalmon: 7.5/10\nTuna: 7/10\nMackerel: 3/10\nIkura: 1/10\nSweet Shrimp: 5/10\n\n*ROLLS*\nMitsuba Lobster: 8.5/10\nParadise: 8/10\nCrazy Eel: 7/10 \n\nPresentation: 10/10\n\n---Restaurant---\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nDecoration: 9/10\nCleanliness: 6/10\n' u"This review is solely based on their service. Not how the food taste. The waiter didnt even bother to write what we ordered and then brought us a wrong dish. We told him it's not ours but he returned a second time insisted he didn't make a mistake. We ordered 3 dishes in total. Each of them came in 25 minutes after one another. I spent more than an hour here waiting for them to cook.\n\nThis is actually not the first time that this kind of thing happened. About a month ago a couple friends and I came here for dinner. There were 8 of us so we ordered about 10 dishes. The waiter didn't write anything down either and later returned to ask what we ordered dish by dish.\n\nDude if you are not that smart what's wrong with writing stuff down? It's super slow so if you are looking for something quick don't come here\n" u"Friendly service great lunch special prices ($8.50 for two rolls plus soup and salad) and an average dining room. \n\nThe fish was pretty fresh - good texture and flavor. We had the salmon yellowtail tuna and eel. The rice was definitely lacking in seasoning and thus also in consistency. There was also a little too much of it in the rolls. So the bland mushy rice overwhelmed any flavor of the fish. The eel sauce is also too sweet.\n\nWith a couple little tweaks though this place could be a good staple for those on the hunt for sushi in Ithaca. I think I'm most curious about the Szezuan menu now...\n" u"First dining experience after arriving for college.\n\nI had mixed feelings about having sushi in Ithaca but this restaurant is just as good as some of my favorite places back home. Fish is served very fresh and in generous portions. I tried three of their special rolls and all were delicious though on the sweeter side. I look forward to trying some of their teriyaki entrees and maybe even their Szechuan dishes (they have a separate menu for Chinese food). The dishes looked beautiful with orchids and dry ice! \nService was good but I did notice that they had only one sushi chef and though our food didn't take forever I can imagine it being more slow when the restaurant is busy. When I was there it looked pretty full though.\n\nI'm really happy I found good sushi here!\n" u"Honestly so disappointed in the service or lack there of. Pretty busy evening it seemed New Year's Eve around 8:30pm but we had reservations. They offered to seat us early since they had a table available. Our server never brought us anything but our waters that we can remember although someone threw bread on the table after our waters. We ordered drinks (brought by the bartender) Appetizer brought by someone else as well as the entrees (Po-boys which we really weren't impressed with at all mine mostly bread and dry I ate all the shrimps out of it and my boyfriend didn't like his due to the black and blue burger having some sort of mayo/sauce he said had egg in it) *Sigh.... I really was excited to try this place and hopefully get my boyfriend to try some seafood. I will say that the Crumb crust oyster appetizer with dipping sauce was actually amazing! Our server just couldn't have cared much less. She never came to ask if we needed anything if our food was good or asked my boyfriend why he wouldn't want a box to take it home. I wanted to stiff her based on the fact that she showed zero interest especially after I didn't and she couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge us as we walked past her to leave.\n" u'After having bad luck with restaurants all over upstate NY area we found this gem in Ithaca. The first order we ordered and picked up. I was amazed at how much food we got. I actually asked them if it was all for us :) We got the tofu and chicken bento boxes and it was great. The next day we went in and got salmon teriyaki chicken teriyaki and shrimp teriyaki and they were all good. They have a free salad bar and they also served us some complimentary white fish rolls. We also tried a sushi platter and it was top-notch as well. Next time we are up there we will be going back.\nAnd yes great service :)\n' u'The new Mitsuba in Camillus NY is fantastic. Been several times. Always fantastic food and service. \nThe Mitsuba in Ithaca NY needs updating. Food and service is hit-and-muss\n' u"Ugh! Why is it so difficult to find a good sushi spot in Ithaca???\n\nCame to Mitsuba for an early dinner. Ordered miso soup which was free since I used their offer edamame spicy tuna roll yellowtail roll and eel roll.  Unfortunately the sushi was just below average.  The fish didn't taste fresh and the rolls were pretty bland. The meal comes with two free volcano rolls and if you write a review on yelp customers get $5 off or a free appetizer. \n\nAs for the service the place was empty so there was little to no waiting time for the food. With tax my tab was only $24.84. Super cheap in my opinion; however service and price alone won't convince me to return. \n\nMaybe their other dishes are better but I personally wouldn't recommend this place for sushi.\n" u"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. My friend and I were attracted by the near-perfect rating and the $10 for $20 deal. This turned out to be the perfect choice for dinner before a concert at the State Street Theater.\n\nWe were seated immediately on a Saturday night at around 5:30 (no surprise; it's fairly early). People trickled in over the next hour including several hibachi parties. We watched some of the action and even witnessed a birthday (the birthday subject is sung a teasing birthday cheer and wears a giant mask very funny).\n\nI knew that it was a great choice the second our waitress handed us real hot towels - something that I wish happened more often it's nice to be pampered - and alerted us to the complimentary salad bar. The ginger dressing was as good as any I've ever had and I was ready to go back for seconds when the waitress brought us a complimentary volcano roll. It was so crispy and delicious!\n\nI ordered the dragon roll and my friend had an avocado roll and a shiitake roll. The presentation was so beautiful with edible orchids and a multicolored dry ice decoration. The rolls themselves were incredibly fresh and tasty honestly flawless.\n\nI'm glad we chose Mitsuba. The staff was friendly and courteous and our bill was $6.50 per person since we used the coupon. \n\nI hope this place gains the popularity it deserves!\n" u'I am so glad that me and my husband decided to try this place! We ordered an alligator roll tri-pepper chicken and beef in spicy pepper sauce! It was incredibly delicious! Plus we got a few free things from the restaurant: deep fried roll salad bar and fruit. It is very rare to find a place that you can have nice eel sushi and authentic Sichuan spicy dishes at the same time! This place is very clean and the waitress are friendly! We will definitely go back again!\n' u"My wife and I have been to Mitsuba about a dozen times and the sushi is fantastic!  Great variety of rolls to choose from.  The restaurant is clean and inviting and the service is also good.  I enjoy the Mohawk roll and the rainbow roll in particular.  \nI'm excited to order from the Chinese menu on our next visit.  \nI really have no experience with authentic Chinese food so any suggestions would be appreciated!\n" u'Came here after dropping off a sibling at CU exhausted and famished. My standards were pretty low and Mitsuba still disappointed.\n\nThere were only 2 servers for approximately 12 tables (one group with 8-10 people). The servers were clearly overwhelmed and it took forever to get any service. The waitress brought my boyfriend a water after he asked for a Sprite. \n\nAfter waiting for 20 minutes we got a complimentary volcano roll. Deep-fried roll with rice and what tasted like leftover odds and ends. I ordered Yaki Udon with vegetables and chicken and it was supposed to be a stir fry but the dish has liquid on the bottom. Boyfriend had the oyako-don. He liked it but gives the disclaimer that "it\'s hard to fuck it up." The spicy salmon roll had too much vinegary rice with old salmon. We ordered another roll with spicy salmon avocado in the middle with eel on top. It wasn\'t great.\n\nAll in all this place might do in a pinch. Order the kitchen items not the sushi and expect a wait. They must have known they would have been swamped with CU families poor planning on their part.\n' u'Our trip to Mitsuba was a nightmare. Dinner both the Chinese and Japanese menus is expensive compared to other places in Ithaca. You can find chinese dishes with bigger portion more authentic szechuan taste and lower price elsewhere. Our party ordered 3 szechuan dishes and was disappointed with the portion considering that they charge more than other similar restaurants in Collegetown. Moreover even with the smaller portion size our party of 10 did not finish even one single dish due to the poor taste. Considering that my friends and I just came from the gym and were starving to the point of ready to eat anything and everything Mitsuba\'s chinese food is beyond hopelessness. Perhaps being the self-aware restaurant that Mitsuba is they sprinkle in their menu the Pad Thai dish as their saving grace. More likely though they just put Pad Thai in due to its popularity. I made the silly mistake of assuming that they know how to cook Pad Thai and ordered one. The chef made it too salty too sweet and too sour and no chilly. It is as if the chef thinks that by putting more of everything in he will make the dish magically tastes better. Their pad thai costing around $9 is said to be "plain" and the waiter said we need to ask for the meat to be added. It is only after we got the bill that we know "plain" is codeword for paying $4 extra for 5 pieces of chicken each was about the size of a baby\'s finger. Their Pad Thai ultimately cost 13$ other Pad Thai in better located restaurants tops at $10.   \n\nThe utter failure of their szechuan dishes are perhaps rivaled only by the miserableness of their "Japanese" dishes. Each dish cost an arm and a leg. And the chef demonstrated his utter ignorance about sushi and Japanese cuisine in general by mixing and matching the ingredients that have nothing to do with one another.  \n\nBut our party\'s trial and tribulations were not over. After asking for a check we received the check with a wrong amount. We called the waitress and got blamed because one of our friend left early and has paid for his meal. They failed to account for that and now could not figure out how to modify the check so I guess the only sensible solution is to blame the customers. All in all please don\'t go.\n' u'I had an early dinner here on a Saturday night. Everything was fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi. No complaints about service. I would definitely return. \nSo far Mitsuba is my favorite of the many Japanese restaurants in town.\n' u'This is my second time being here for its new Chinese spicy food. The first time I brought four friends for dinner. We ordered seven dishes and I liked most of them. They add tips automatically without notice though. I would give four star based on that visit.\n\nThe second time I came here for lunch and ordered three new dishes from the Chinese menu to try. The taste is totally different from last time. I could not eat much due to their strange flavor. So I guess choosing right dishes is very important. Avoid picking these three dishes in the pic will save you some money :)\n']
89.D P Dough,[u'Hole in the wall calzone joint that was pretty good! Talk about a pleasant surprise!\n\nMy friend and I each got a "Drop Zone" calzone. It comes with chicken two types of cheese and pepperoni. Both of them cost about $9 so it was a good deal. \n\nI liked the fact that the calzone was pretty big and the cheese was pretty good. But the chicken was pretty raw and that was a bit of a letdown to an otherwise good calzone. The late hours are really great because it is convenient for the college kids. Plus you can write on the walls in chalk!\n\nA cute hole-in-the-wall with extra flair for extra fun!\n' u'DP Dough serves up a wide assortment of calzones. The dough and sauce are both mediocre but I suppose the creative topping combos sort of make up for that. Open super late and probably best eaten after a night out.\n' u"I was in Ithaca for my son's wedding and saw they had a DP Dough! I haven't had DP Dough since my years at UMass Amherst many moons ago.  I of course had to order and was pleasantly surprised with how it was exactly how I remembered!  Parking Zone and the Oh Zone are my favorites!\n" u'pricey for what you get but they\'re open wicked late which is a huge advantage in a "college" town\n' u'This place is super fat and really best after partying and ordering around 1 AM. The buffer zone with buffalo chicken is the best one but they are all tasty and make you feel like a slob. Still great though\n' u'I ordered a 20oz Sprite and they gave me this very sketchy half drank open Canada Dry....very odd. But other than that the food was great and delivered on time!\n' u'Best calzone place in Ithaca.  Made the right way with ricotta .... Highly recommend any ZONE!  Friendly service awesome college atmosphere.\n' u'Very good calzones and cheese sticks! From someone from who is spoiled by Chicago pizza this was a decent alternative. I was pleasantly surprised. The sausage could have tasted better but everything else was great.\n' u"One of the best calzones I've ever had. Tons of great cheese and the crust was just perfect. I got the Meaty and it was loaded with onions and meatballs. One downside is that there are only a couple of tables inside so if it's rainy or ugly out it's pretty much a to-go only place.\n" u'These are so good! The bread is so chewy and yummy! Best cure for a hang over! Not much else to say!\n' u"Decent as far as late night food is concerned although they didn't follow through on my order of parm/Italian herb crust. It's calzones can't go in expecting gourmet or anything and the portions are huge. So it's good for the price.\n" u'Terrible. \n\n45 minutes in and I called them to check up on an order. Guy picks up and I ask what the status was..."it\'s on it\'s way" with the worst attitude and hangs up on me. He didn\'t even ask for my name or apologize. 20 min later and still no food. \n\nAt least the driver was nice about it.\n' u"These are some of the best Calzones ever. The calzones are always a good size enough for one person.\n\nThey always fill them pretty decently with your choices. I love Wednesday as they have their 2 for $10 calzones (regular) which is a darn good deal!\n\nI usually always get tater tots in my calzones as they are the bomb!\n\nI've tried their chicken bacon ranch buffalo chicken and breakfast calzones and would order all of them again!\n\nTheir delivery is usually between 30-45 minutes which isn't bad at all!\n\nOverall this is my go to calzone place and for late night snacks as they are open wicked late!\n" u'It is what it is. Dive-y little back-alley shack that serves up yummy endlessly greasy calzones!\n' u"This was ok.  It's super greasy drunk food.  Service was meg at best and they didn't get the order completely right.  Didn't ask them to fix it as it was like 0300 and just didn't feel like it.  Would go back just need to ensure that expectations are set properly.\n" u'This was a must-do at my 10-year college reunion and D.P. Dough is as good as I remember. Reenacting our college practice we called to order in the wee morning hours after drinking away the night in the Arts Quad. \n\nThe girl on the phone advised me to put some barbecue sauce into my Construction Zone (steak mushroom cheese!) and I did so however haphazardly instructing her to pour as much as possible due to inebriation. Despite the gallon of BBQ sauce injected into my calzone it was still delicious.\n\nThe delivery guy and I spent a bit of time debating the best pickup spot for Balch Hall. Apparently he thought it was by the dumpsters while I assumed out front. Next time listen to the driver.\n' u"D.P. Dough was perhaps the place my guy had been looking forward to revisiting the most.  He's an Ithaca College alumnus and hadn't been back to the area in nearly 10 years until last Monday.\n\nNo-frills place complete with a sketchy parking lot and filthy bathroom.  I counted ~40 calzone varieties on the wall menu as well as a few other items.\n\nMy pesto 'zone was disappointing and contained loads of gooey greasy mozzarella really small pieces of diced tomato and barely discernible pesto.  Where was the pesto?!  My boyfriend had warned me in advance that the nostalgic aspect of D.P. Dough is likely the reason he remembered the calzones so fondly.  \n\nDelivery until 4AM on Fridays (Saturday mornings) and Saturdays (Sunday mornings) and open pretty damn late every other night as well.\n \nHit up D.P. Dough if you're...\n...a local college student with a late-night fatty food craving after the bars. \n...a lover of inexpensive calzones.\n...on a trip down Memory Lane like my boyfriend.\n \nIf you don't fall into one of the above categories you may find yourself disappointed and dissatisfied after consuming the calories and saturated fat associated with one of these monster calzones.\n" u'Super greasy yummy late night food.\n\nThey deliver until 2am so its nice if you are up late or drinking.\n' u"They're a little stingy on the marinara when it comes to their calzones which I feel kind of ruined it for me and now I can see why they offer marinara on the side (for an additional charge) that's a bit stingy if you ask me (especially for a place that specializes in stuff covered and filled with marinara). I like to order specific fillings that aren't overly powerful in flavor since marinara in and of itself is flavorful so in the end it was a bit on the bland side.\n" u'Delicious hand made calzones! A bit divey and located in a shady alley way but it was delicious! I had the BBQ Chicken Calzone. Awesome.\n']
117.Lou‚Äôs Hot Dog Stand,[u'For $3 it is the best decision you will make all day.\n\n...provided your expectation is hot dogs sausages or chicken spiedie char-grilled.\n' u"Damn good hotdogs but he's pretty damn political. Then again it is Ithaca so no surprise there.\n" u'This unmarked hot dog station in the middle of the Commons right outside of Bank of America is an Ithaca fixture. They serve classic all beef grilled hot dogs with any of the following items kosher New York City sauerkraut freshly grilled onions and peppers spicy pepper relish onions classic pickle relish Nancy\'s mustard and of course ketchup and yellow mustard. They even have veal dogs Italian pork sausages and chicken spiedies (grilled chicken cubes in a hotdog bun -- spiedies are an upstate NY invention). I have tried all of these options and they are all fantastic but I am a purest and love the kosher all beef dog with grilled peppers and a touch of sauerkraut the best. You can also purchase frito-lay bags of chips and bottled/canned drinks.\n\nHe uses local wieners ...tee hee....from Hofmann\'s franks based out of Syracuse New York. Lou notes that he thinks that "central New Yorkers prefer the grilled flavor to the classic New York city steamed or boiled hot dogs." This is why he switched to a gas powered grill in 2001. I can\'t agree more I love the grill.\n\nLou is super friendly and he\'ll chat with you as he prepares your dogs. Its $2 per hot dog. One dog is a great snack 2 dogs or 1 chicken spiedie is a great meal. I never "plan" to eat here as the hours are dependent on the wether I usually see them while walking around the commons and can\'t resist.\n']
10.Saigon Kitchen,[u"Great place and reasonable prices!\nThe interior was very cute with lovely pictures and the waiter was also easy on the eyes ;)\nDefinitely get the Vietnamese coffee!\nPho was decent what you would expect. Portion sizes of the pho was huge!\n\nIf you're walking from collegetown be aware you pass through the shadier areas of Ithaca.\n" u"My family visited Saigon Kitchen while in Ithaca to watch a swim meet. The meet had wrapped up in the afternoon and we were looking for a spot to grab a bite for lunch. Overall I felt like the experience was good. It definitely isn't the same as eating Vietnamese food in the city. The flavors are more simple and you definitely don't get all the same garnishes and extras. Also the prices are a few bucks more than city prices but I get that this is Ithaca and options are limited here in terms of Asian food. I wish we could give 3.5 stars since I think that would be a more accurate rating. \n\nSummer Rolls Appetizer $5 - A nice tight wrap and fresh ingredients but I felt like they could have added more cilantro and mint. Also the sauce was thick and clumpy not necessarily a bad thing but just different from what I've seen before.\n\nCrispy Squid Appetizer $8 - This dish was good nice and crispy you could tell it was just out of the fryer. It just felt a little expensive for the 15 small pieces you get.\n\nBo Vien Pho $10 - This is the meatball pho. The broth was on the sweeter side and they give you a lot of pho noodles which is great! On the side they gave you basil lime and bean sprouts as usual but I would have loved some cilantro and culantro.\n\nTai Nam Bo Vien Pho ($10) - This is the round steak brisket and meatball pho.\n\nGrilled Vietnamese Pork Chop Rice ($11) - Nice sized. I would recommend they make the pork chops thicker as ours were very thinly sliced which made them a little dry and chewy. \n\nAvocado Shake ($4) - Very good! Fresh avocado.\n\nSpace: The restaurant was nice and casual. Had nice seating and had a lot of tables. \n\nService: I feel like they could have been a little more flexible with there lunch special times. We came in around 1:52PM and the server told us that if we order lunch special we needed to order right away as the lunch special ended at 2:00PM. He came back around 1:55 and we said we weren't sure if we what we wanted to do. At 2PM another guy comes over to take our order and my mom decided she did want to order something off the lunch menu. He asked us what time it was when we said it was exactly 2 he said that means it's too late - lunch is over. I mean...I get it but I also felt like it was poorly handled. He still could have given us the lunch special. I understand if you get seated at 2 or after 2 but we were there and I'm not kidding - it was literally 2PM when we were ordering. That's where they lost some points with me.\n\nParking: There isn't actually any restaurant parking behind the restaurant like it looks. That lot is all other business parking and vendor parking. There is quite a bit of metered street parking out front though.\n" u"We went to Finger Lakes and had to stop by to see Cornell campus (go Food Science/Sensory Science people!).  After a weekend of wine drinking and hearty Viennese food Vietnamese sounded perfect.  This place was packed on a Sunday night so that's good it's where the students go.  I had the special beef pho and inhaled it and not bothering to talk to my friends.  I guess I was that hungry :)  They ordered one of the noodles dish and it was very tasty.  \n\nRestroom was clean for campus restaurant and friendly staff.  Worth your while.\n" u"I've never had Pho before so I have nothing to compare this too but the food was really good. Had the Crab Rangoons and the Wanton Dumpling Noodle Pho and they were delicious. I always get rangoons at every Asian restaurants and these were one of the better ones. Can't wait to try more Pho after this!\n" u"If I could eat here every meal for the rest of my life I would. That's all you need to know.\n" u"(23/100)\nThis place was just fabulous. 5 stars all day. \n\nParking wasn't the best. The lot behind the restaurant isn't actually for the restaurant so we circled around and easily found metered parking. 54 minutes got us through our leisure meal. \n\nThe place was busy but we were seated right when we entered. Our server was prompt and funny. We ordered a lot and somehow managed to eat it all. A for ambition and defying odds! Lol. \n\nI recently learned I like boba tea. I had the Jackfruit Smoothie with boba. Yum. The fried squid as everyone says was phenomenal. The meat roll was good. I wasn't in love but my boyfriend was. Meat is more his thing than mine. Boyfriend also had hot and sour soup. My favorite soup and it was delicious. My vermicelli was soooo good. So good. I ate it all. The vegetables were so crisp and the tofu was beautifully cooked in honey lemongrass seasoning. He had black bean and chili with chicken side was fried rice. It was a unique black bean paste with some smoke to it. Very good. He loved it. All of the above was further seasoned by a variety of hot sauces on the table. That concludes our meal. All for $40. \n\nI have no complaints at all about this restaurant. I encourage everyone to check it out.\n" u"I was in Ithaca visiting a friend at Cornell and we were craving Vietnamese food! This was the only place nearby with decent reviews and everyone told me it was good so my friend and I went here for lunch. First off this place was packed on an early Sunday afternoon! We were there a little after 12PM and we were about 20 minutes early enough to beat the crowd. Others who came after us had to wait at least 15 minutes for a table. \n\nWe wanted to order something simple that will keep us full for our 5 hours drive back to NYC so of course we went with pho (I picked the pho with beef and beef balls). As a Vietnamese I've tasted plenty of pho during my lifetime none will taste as good as pho made by my own mother I'm afraid but I've tasted some that are pretty darn close. So it was not to my surprised that this pho was a little better than average. I give it a solid 6 on a 1 to 10 scale. I found that the broth was not flavorful enough.\n\nI also tried their avocado smoothie with bubbles. It was okay...they put way WAYYY too much ice in it and I can barely taste the avocado flavor but it wasn't horrible I guess. \n\nI would recommend trying the other dishes that they have on the menu. I've had the pleasure of trying their fried squid at one of Cornell's catering events and it was really delicious; it was crispy and the dipping sauce that goes with it was really good as well. I also tried their bo luc lac (it's a stir fried beef dish) the flavors were okay but the beef was a tad bit chewy when I had it at the event but that might be because it wasn't served fresh. So in conclusion if you're going to come here try something else besides the pho!\n" u'Today was the first time I\'ve tried Saigon Kitchen and I must say that everything that I ordered was spot on! As a Vietnamese person I am quite acquainted with traditional authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Many of the so-called Vietnamese restaurants I\'ve tried up to this point have been largely disappointing or mediocre at best. However Saigon Kitchen is most definitely a positive exception.\n\nThe first thing I have to mention is the ambiance. It\'s nice overall but the place was packed at the time that I arrived. There were approximately two empty tables when I came. By the time I left there was a line that stretched outside the door. I suppose this is a testament to the popularity of Saigon Kitchen but be prepared to stand in a line especially during busy days and hours. Needless to say the wait will be worth it. The servers were quite nice too. They didn\'t do anything special but more importantly they didn\'t do anything that belittled me as a customer.\n\nI ordered three items at my visit: The Vietnamese Iced Coffee with condensed milk the crispy squid and the pho tai nam bo vien. The iced coffee is a must if you\'re a coffee fan. There\'s always something special about Vietnamese coffee and this place makes it very well. It was smooth creamy and not too sweet. The crispy squid is not something I\'d typically order in terms of authenticity but many other Yelp reviewers highly recommended it so I had to try. I am excited to say that the fried squid was incredibly wonderful. I have eaten many calamari dishes at many restaurants but I must say that I\'m pleasantly surprised that this tops them all off. The batter was not too heavy and the squid was not too chewy. The dipping sauce was a lovely addition as well. Great overall. \n\nFinally the main attraction the pho. The one I got is called "pho tai nam bo vien" which comes with thin slices of rare beef brisket and beef meatballs. You can always tell a quality pho by the quality of the broth and the broth here was outstanding. Nicely balanced and flavourful. Also unlike other restaurants they weren\'t heavy on the broth either. The ratio of ingredients was impressive and I was quite satisfied. The meat was tender and I could easily break it apart with my chopsticks and spoon and the meatball was satisfyingly chewy and bouncy. I rarely finish the entirety of a bowl of pho but my bowl was clean when I was finished. \n\nOverall I had a pleasant experience. I would definitely come back to this place and try their other dishes and I\'d highly recommend you to try Saigon Kitchen as well especially if you\'re a big fan of pho.\n' u"As Fall weather began to set in I really started craving some pho. I'm glad we came to Saigon Kitchen as it was perfect to satisfy my craving! We came for lunch on a Saturday around 1:30 and I was surprised when it was still a full-house. We waited a few minutes before being seated and it seemed that we came at the right time because after us there were 4-5 more parties that came in to wait. \n\nWe got the steamed pork potstickers as an appetizer and they were delicious! I got the Tai Bo Vien pho. The broth was so good and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The meatballs were pretty standard but the ribeye beef slices were too tough and cut into too big of pieces in my opinion. Overall yummy though!\n" u"This place is good but average. It's the type of place I would go to if there were no other Vietnamese places to choose from.\n\nThe summer rolls with shrimp were not good. Very very plain with mostly vegetables and a thin sliver of shrimp.\n\nThe bun plate was tiny and again mostly vegetables. I will say the beef was excellently seasoned and the beef is this places saving grace.\n\nGlad I tried but wouldn't return.\n" u'Best pho in town the dishes are cooked to perfection. The line can be long to get in the door but definitely worth the wait. Great bubble tea too!\n' u"I'm visiting from NYC and for some odd reason I was feening for some Tofu spring rolls.  I searched for some Vietnamese food via Yelp and VOILA!!!!!  I saw this restaurant and I was curious to know why this place had almost 5 stars. \n\nWe got seated immediately. The waiter came soon after I order a strawberry Smoothie and tofu spring rolls. The spring roll was yummy and the smoothie was mixed well to perfection. My entree was the vegetable & Tofu Vermicelli. I only waited about 10 minutes for my entree. It was really good. The waiter was very nice and make sure that we was enjoying our meal. He didnt rush to leave when 2 large parties came in to eat and the restaurant is kinda small. \n\nTips Recommendations and others \n\n1. The parking. We couldn't find the parking lot. We believe the parking lot is located in the back of the restaurant. In the front of the restaurant their is meter parking. Ithaca is gangsta with their parking meters. You have to pay the meter all day every day from 9-6 pm even on Sundays and Holidays (Poor Santa Claus he has to wait after 6pm to park his reindeers for free). \n2. My non vegan homie had the imperial rolls as appetizers. For the entree is was the general chicken. What I like is that you decided how hot you want it by levels 0 ( not hot at all) to 10 (boom boom caliente). He choosed 3 and he said it was hot. But he enjoy it much. \n3. I didnt know that the black balls at the bottom of the bubble tea was Black pearl tapiocas. \n4. They have coat section so you can hang up your coats and jackets. \n5. Enjoy!\n" u'Overpriced Americanized Vietnamese food with little flavor... I got a vegetarian bun (rice noodles) which was supposed to be a cold dish but the vegetables were cooking the noodles a second time and wilting the lettuce underneath.\n\nHubby got the bun with pork which was decent.\n' u"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I always get the Tai Gau (in the beef pho section) which is super yummy and huge. I also love how they give the sprouts and limes on the side which is nice because I'm not a huge fan of sprouts and like to put my own quantity in. \nThe appetizers are really tasty and really inexpensive. I've tried the Imperial Meat rolls ($5 for two and make a great sharing appetizer that will tide you over until your entree without being too filling). The potstickers are also really good (I believe they're $6 for 5 of them or something like that- either way a great deal). It makes me a little suspicious how quickly the appetizers come out however. I suspect they come in frozen and are microwaved for a few minutes before brought out to the guests. They're cheap enough and tasty enough however that I don't really care. \nAnother nice thing about this restaurant is that it is BYOB which makes it a great post-wine tour dinner if you pick up a bottle from one of the wineries in Seneca. \nOne star off for service. Due to this restaurant's popularity it's always an absolute zoo when you come in. There is little waiting room near the front and the hostess/wait staff always seems flustered. Last time I went my boyfriend and I came without a reservation and we put our name on a list. Our name got crossed off prematurely and we had to inform them that we hadn't been seated yet. Moral of the story: MAKE A RESERVATION. We brought a bottle of wine last time and asked for glasses which we were brought but the server ran away before we could ask for a corkscrew. \nBasically go for the food- which is yummy cheap and fast but don't expect to have a fine dining or service experience.\n" u"Found this nice spot while looking for a place to eat during a short visit to Ithaca and I must say this place was packed especially with students. I had the pho fried fish and fried calamari as well! Compared to the pho from NYC this wasn't as great but the fish and the calamari was good!\n" u"One of the best beef phos I've ever had-- hearty and delicious also authentic and stewed for hours. Bring my family here everytime they visit-- their picky Southeast Asian eaters as well-- love this place as well!\n" u'This was absolutely disappointing! The pho was way too sweet and they wanted 6 wingettes for $7.00! Absurd. We threw our food out. If you want good pho go to Nhu Y restaurant in vestal NY. Amazing!\n' u"I ordered the Volcano Stir Fry last night and it was absolutely awful. Vegetables totally over cooked exactly TWO small pieces of pineapple and it should be described as a sweet sauce not a tangy garlic sauce. On top of that I paid $13 for a VERY sub par meal. I wouldn't eat there again.\n" u"Vietnamese cuisine at its finest. The food was so well cooked and it's authentic. The apps are decent portions and the food itself is filling. I tried out the lunch deal with the chicken black bean sauce. Why don't they bottle the sauce? I'd drink it. \n\nSoda is by the can. So uh yeah not free refills.\n" u"It is always crowded here but for good reason - the food is fresh delicious and reasonably priced. Service can be hit or miss and it's definitely rushed. The tables also all seem to wobble terrible which isn't a big deal but it is annoying.\n\nI had the lemongrass chicken vermicelli and it was light and very flavorful. I've had the pho here in the past which is good as well. I also tried a bite of the flounder which was surprisingly good and had a delicious sauce. \n\nAll in all definitely come here for the food but be prepared to wait and for less-than-ideal service.\n"]
155.Miyake Japanese Restaurant,[u"I'll start off by saying that Miyake probably has the best sushi in Collegetown or downtown (and I've tried them all). The quality of their sushi is great and their entrees also come out hot and delicious. \n\nHOWEVER: the caveats are that the restaurant is always empty whenever I come in though I only ever come in for lunch. There's a weird disinfectant smell on one side of the restaurant (the side without the sushi bar). And they are pricier than their competitors meaning Plum Tree up the street. But if you want better sushi than Plum Tree I'd recommend going to Miyake particularly on their Tuesday nights for their 30% off specials.\n" u'the food was quite mediocre and the tuna rolls were not that great\n' u"A great establishment for getting together with a large group for date nights and special events not so great for a sit-down dinner. In fact the idea of going to Miyake for dinner seems rather unusual as it's so much better known as a place for college students to go sake bombing. The sushi here is NOT fresh fish tasted warm and metallic... Their hot entrees are too heavy on sauces and are either too sweet or salty. I'd go to Plum Tree instead or even better Sumo up near the mall.\n" u'We made a reservation here but they didn\'t have a table for us. They stuck us in some back corner sharing a table with other patrons. We then had to flag down a waiter just to get water and order. We then waited for an hour and twenty minutes while continually asking for updates on our food and never getting a response. Finally we walked up and asked how long it would be and they said "at least another twenty minutes." At this point we paid for our drinks and left while the waitress made the excuse that it was busy despite the restaurant being empty by that point. Would not recommend. This is also not the first time that this has happened.\n' u"Came here on a date (we're a gay couple). The waiter clearly had a problem with it did not give us anything we ordered and proceeded to actively ignore us. When we ordered sake he rolled a single warm can of Sapparo on the table so quickly that it knocked over the soy sauce on the table. Hope this piece of sh!it place gets shut down ASAP.\n" u"One of my favorite restaurants in Collegetown! The Crazy Girl and Super Bowl are my favorite dishes and the fish used seems very fresh. You can't go wrong with any roll you choose!\n\nThe servers are nice and give good recommendations. Call ahead and make reservations if you have a larger party as the restaurant can be busy.\n" u"Great food at a reasonable price. Above all the ingredients are very high quality and they don't skimp on the good stuff. I got the Sashimi platter and each piece (9 total) was fresh and the size of a grapefruit section. This is the best sushi I've had since Morimoto in Napa Valley and at literally 1/3 the cost.\n" u"Service was not fantastic -- took about 15 minutes for someone to get to us. They also only brought water for half the table even though the place was not that crowded. Food wasn't particularly worth the wait.\n" u"Having just moved here and didn't know anyone in town at the time I just went to the first restaurant that caught my eye while wandering around my neighborhood. Probably should have wandered around some more...\n\nSince I was eating alone I didn't want to go for sushi. I spent all day shopping for stuff to fill my apartment and didn't want to spend that much more money on their overpriced rolls. I went for the nabeyaki udon. It was expensive too for udon but at least it beat getting two sushi rolls and still feeling hungry after. Turned out the udon wasn't that great either - noodles were kinda tough and I was going through it and was wondering why there was no chicken. It turned out it was just one small piece buried at the bottom underneath all the vegetables.\n\nAlso the place at the time was packed with students returning to campus and meeting up and they were all doing sake bombs. It was like each table took turns doing them so every two minutes a different table would start and you would hear them banging their tables and their drinks splattering. It's just very disruptive. Plus it seemed like the wait staff cared more about refilling their drinks than serving the few other tables in the place especially mine since I was just eating alone.\n" u"I only come here on Tuesdays cause they have specials for their sushi. The sushi itself is pretty good but the service I've experienced has been terrible at times. When it re-opened I had to wait nearly 2 hours before they gave us a small plate of edamame on the house. I was ready to walk out the door...Anyway they have some pretty good rolls such as their lion king roll. And their fried ice cream is also very delicious and a nice treat at the end of the meal. \n\nConvenient location in Collegetown for Japanese and it's better than Plum Tree in my opinion.\n" u"Located in Ithaca New York Miyake offers some of the best and most Japanese dishes in town. The restaurant is indeed not cheap; however considering the expenses the restaurant has to pay for the transportation of all the fresh ingredients to upstate New York it is indeed not a bad deal for students who are tired of eating greasy pizzas burgers and fries. In addition the quality of the food accounts for the price. Both the seafood and vegetables used in their dishes are fresh. Not only do they use fresh ingredients Miyake is known to have some the best Japanese dishes in town making them one of the most popular restaurants among students. \n\nDue to such a positive reputation Miyake currently supplies sushi to Mac's Caf\xe9 located in Statler Hall on a daily basis for Cornell students to enjoy a Japanese meal at a more convenient location. Not only does Miyake have fresh quality food but it also has a variety of menu options. The restaurant offers a large variety of Japanese cuisine from sushi rolls udon gyoza to sashimi. Many refuse to go to restaurants with a wide range of menus believing that they don't provide quality food; yet Miyake is different. With great cross utilization of ingredients the restaurant offers a variety of quality gourmets that most people would enjoy. \n\nSome of the most famous dishes at Miyake include the Crazy Boy Roll and the Super Bowl. In fact the Crazy Boy Roll is one of the most authentic dishes at Miyake where the crab and avocado sushi roll is fried and topped with savory thick soy sauce. On the other hand the Super Bowl is a combination of assorted sashimi lettuce crunches and Miyake's special sauce in a bowl creating an authentic Miyake style main course meal.\n\nMiyake not only excels in the food itself but also in their level of service. The waiters seem to be well trained. When you first sit down at the table the server will instantly serve you with ice water along with your menu. They also ask whether you would prefer a hot cup of green tea to melt down from the chilly weather of Ithaca. The food is then delivered about 10 minutes after ordering. When the food is served the waiter brings over extra plates allowing you to share the food if you would like. Thus the service at Miyake is quick and they attempt to serve any additional needs before you ask them.\n\nIn addition to the great service the d\xe9cor of the restaurant enhances your dining experience. Miyake is not the top-notch restaurant with fancy decorations. However the simple red and wood tone colors and the sushi bar incorporated offer a cozy traditional Japanese look and feeling. For those who place an emphasis on the sanitization of the restaurant all the tables are wiped and the bathrooms are clean for use. \n\nIndeed Miyake isn't a flawless restaurant. In fact they did have some minor issues with the order in which they serve food and the saltiness. For instance Miyake once served the main dish before the appetizer--not the best choice a restaurant could make. Yet such mistakes could have been a one-time occurrence. One of the long-term problems of Miyake would be the saltiness of the food. Some of the plates such as the Spicy Yaki Udon and Super Bowl seemed overly salty. Especially for student from the millennial generation who attempts to eat healthier such salty dishes are not the best attractions. Despite these minor drawbacks Miyake is the restaurant to visit as it offers some of the best quality and fresh Japanese dishes in town along with appreciable service and menu variety.\n" u"Sushi was terrible and the udon I had is the sane udon my friend had but the only thing is different is the side meat entree. Couldn't even call the udon Japanese. More like Japanese udon in Chinese soup broth\n" u"Miyake was my one and only experience eating sushi in Ithaca. Sushi is my favorite food and I found myself preferring to drive to Wegman's for supermarket pre-made sushi than to go to one of the sushi restaurants in Collegetown after trying Miyake.\n\nThe rice was hard. There wasn't much fish and the fish that was in the roll wasn't good quality. And on top of that it cost me ~$13/roll which compares to good specialty rolls in bigger cities. Lol...\n\nOur waiter was nice though. Unfortunately not enough for me to ever want to go back. Go to Wegmans.\n" u'Both sushi and kitchen food are always delicious in my experience. If the service is a little slow as other reviewers have mentioned this is simply because there are limited sushi chefs and orders can become a bit backed up. If you come on a weekday it is pretty unlikely that this will be an issue since fewer people come in than on weekends and there are fewer orders to suck up time. If you do come on a weekend and are crunched for time a good tip is that kitchen food tends to be finished faster than sushi bar fare. Coming for lunch any day is sure to cut the wait time dramatically. \n\nThe Super Bowl crazy girl roll and OMG roll are all incredible sushi options. \n\nFor kitchen food Katsu Don is my favorite. \n\nMiyake makes a noticeable effort to have a wide variety of vegetarian options available and there are plenty of great choices in both sushi and kitchen food. \n\nIn terms of sake Miyake has great options including the ever-fun Sake Bomb. Plum sake is my favorite. And since these involve no cooking you will never wait for drinks!\n\nThe only reason a subtracted a star was for waiting time-- which is really only an issue because the popularity of the restaurant creates a great many orders. I definitely recommend Miyake.\n' u'Terrible sushi! I thought Plum Tree was bad for the futile quest to find palatable sushi in Ithaca but Miyake is worse. Rice is not sticky enough and fish tasted old.\n' u"The Oh My God roll comes out on fire! I don't mean it's spicy I mean it's literally lit on fire - wrapped in tin foil and served flaming. When I saw it on the menu I thought it was just gimmicky. But after ordering and tasting it my mind is changed -- the char flavor of the fish really complements the rest of the flavors and I am not usually a fan of baked rolls. Their sake bombs are pretty large large enough for light weights to share amongst two people. This said the place is expensive and the quality is just OK but they get a sympathy star for being in Ithaca a place with no great sushi restaurants.\n" u"Only go to Miyake's if you have the entire day to spend waiting for a mediocre at best meal. I went with two friends and ordered at exactly 7:30PM. 20 minutes later the waitress came up to us and said our food was next in line and will be out in a few minutes. 10 more minutes pass and my food (Nabeyaki udon) finally comes out (which was just OK and much worse than that of Plum Tree or Cafe Pacific). My two friends were still waiting for their food and eventually got their rolls a total of 50 minutes later. I literally could have driven to the asian mart got the ingredients and cooked it myself for much better cheaper and faster. \n\nIf it was just the wait time I would not be as disappointed in this restaurant but they served me my food 20 minutes before my friends got theirs. By waiting for them my udon got completely cold. What was even MORE upsetting was that there were large groups that came in way after us but they got their food first. The waitress herself even admitted that the manager wanted to make sure all the larger groups were prioritized. Obviously this restaurant does not care about the satisfaction of the customers unless they're large groups who will likely leave them more tip and money. \n\nThe only reason I give this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 is because I didn't get food poisoning (yet).\n\nI am never coming back here again. I hope management cares enough about their restaurant to read these yelp reviews and actually fix their problems.\n" u"Sort of yum...\n\nThis is place is okay. It has decent sushi and decent other Japanese dishes but it's pricey. They have some creative rolls based on Cornell and Ithaca and whatnot as well as typical normal rolls.\n\nThey do have specials on certain days which can help you out.\n\nI gave it 2 stars because it's really nothing to write home about and I believe they had their liquor license suspended multiple times for serving alcohol to underage students. Experienced one or two instances in which we were told that they weren't allowed to serve liquor for a few months and so we couldn't have any sake with our meal! Staff is friendly and helpful though.\n\nAmbiance is okay though I suppose. Mood lighting makes it an okay place to bring a date.\n" u"Yeah... not too great not too bad. If you're craving sushi though well... you're stuck between here and Plumtree. Miyakes is definitely much better. Tuesday has 30% off sushi rolls only not their entire menu. Watch out for that.\n\nHowever I love the Superbowl and Hwe Dup Bap... agh woe is me. Why can't I get that stuff 30% off. I live with the pain. If you're looking for decent sushi come here. It's definitely super pricey but what kind of sushi isn't? \n\nThe service isn't bad and the atmosphere is pretty chill and nice.\n" u'Miyake definitely has its highs and lows.\n\nHighs: Miyake has an extensive list of sushi rolls; for an experience I highly recommend the "Oh My God! Roll" which arrives on fire! Its quite expensive but its fun to get it one time. For a less expensive but equally delicious option try the Lion King which has a really bright lemon flavor. The tempura ice cream reminiscent of a Mexican fried ice cream is a delicious end to dinner that I highly recommend. \n\nLows: The service is painfully slow. If you are with a group of friends pounding back saki bombs and having a grand-old time this probably won\'t be a problem for you but if you show up to the restaurant starving you are probably going to end up a little grumpy. Speaking of saki bombs don\'t go to Miyake on a Friday or Saturday night due to the high concentrations of fraternity students yelling "SAKI SAKI SAKI BOMB!" that tends to kill the atmosphere of a quiet dinner.\n']
97.The Bistro at La Tourelle,[u'I would suggest the stuffed pancakes yummmmm! Very cute place to enjoy breakfast before you start your day.\n' u'Beautiful breakfast option: goodlocal food nice dining room and outside dining in the summer.\nFor $14.95 you get fresh fruit pastries coffee/juice/tea and a breakfast entree. The savory dishes seem to be a better deal but the French Toast here never disappoints. Oatmeal crusted the thick pieces of bread a crispy on the outside not overly sweet and very fluffy. \nFor the savory option - you get to pick your own ingredients for the omelette. I highly recommend the bacon-asparagus-goat cheese combination.\n\nAlways a lovely time here. The surroundings are great too! Highly recommend.\n' u"This is a quaint adorable little place in the lovely La Tourelle Inn. The bistro operates a very simple locally sourced and delicious breakfast which is also offered as a brunch on the weekends. Lunch offerings are also elegant simple and perfect for a break away from the office for the classroom when you feel like you need a nice treat. Prices are quite modest: $15 for the breakfast which includes several choices between pancakes French toast farmer style breakfast omelettes and all come with a breakfast pastry fruit bowl toast and coffee or tea. It is quite the steal for only $15 plus do you factor in that they're mostly organic or otherwise locally sourced ingredients.\n\nI myself have just eaten breakfast here for days in a row and have a mentally enjoyed it each time. The atmosphere is that of a country inn: quaint friendly and you get the feeling like you are the only person who matters. Every server I had was sweet friendly and sensitive to the fact that I was actually trying to move through my meal so that I could get to my business. The omelettes are absolutely fantastic especially with the local organic meats and vegetables selections I highly recommend anything with goat cheese. \n\nThe Bistro and I will definitely have a future relationship together as I plan on making it a stop every time I'm back in town even if I'm not staying at this hotel.\n" u'Please note the food was good. We\'re giving it a 4 out of 5 because of the service. I needed some OJ to take my meds so my boyfriend went down to the cafe for some since breakfast was included in our weekend package. He was greeted by a waitress who was not the friendliest as she simply said "that will be $1.85" instead of saying "sure we can bill the room or are you a part of the package this weekend." We eventually ended up just going back to sit down and eat/drink instead. Upon our arrival the same waitress stated "the guy with the orange juice" and proceeded to sit us. I spotted lipstick on my coffee cup and asked for a replacement...it never came. The walls were really nasty from previous food splatters. However on the positive side the pastries were warm and flakey! Delish!! The fruit was precut and refrigerated so we had lots of bad spots so not too fresh. The eggs were cooked well but awfully greasy. The oatmeal crusted french toast was so succulent and sweet. Overall we loved that they use local ingredients. The food was tasty and the fruit and customer service could be better.\n' u'Had a couple of times pretty good lunch and brunch there over past year or two. Went there yesterday with an invited speaker and was frankly embarrassed.  Super slow service half of the menu  could not be served -  "because they were so busy" -(?? at 1 pm  besides our table they had only two other tables to serve??).  The last two sandwiches they managed to serve us were *OK*.  Left with general impression like they were scared if we god forbid would order something else.  How many people do they normally expect to feed at one day lunch? 3? 4?\n' u"Went for Sunday brunch. Ordered the shrimp and polenta (the classy man's shrimp 'n' grits) and it was decent - a bit under-seasoned for my taste even with the chorizo. People always rave about their oatmeal-crusted french toast and it really is quite delicious. Had a taste of my friend's omelette which...tasted like an omelette (nothing really to complain about there but also nothing to rave about). \n\nI haven't tried the lunch at the La Tourelle location but I did have a really great steak salad and flatbread pizza at the Sheldrake Point Winery location before it closed.\n" u'BEST BRUNCH in ithaca hands down. Blew me (and my friends away).\n\nAlmost everything we ordered were SO mindblowingly delicious! :) \n\nMore details here: \n\nhttp://inagoodfoodmood.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/good-brunch-in-ithaca-almost-non-existent/\n' u"Excellent service by the wait staff which was especially appreciated considering I was out of both dress and element at this spa-supported restaurant. \n\nI came here for brunch today at 11:30 am planning on coffee and a light meal. After looking over the menu I went for plain coffee with milk and chose the frittata with artichoke and goat cheese topping as my course. Two of my companions made the same choice.\n\nThe plate came quickly and I found the presentation appealing - slices of fruit stacked and breakfast potatoes nestled under fresh greens with a wedge of... omelet?\n\nIt did not appear like a frittata which is commonly cooked as a slice of egg-based pie but instead as an egg dish that was folded over its ingredients like an omelet.\n\nWhile much of the periphery of the dish was delicious (I went for seconds on the salad by stealing greens from my girlfriends' plate!) there were parts that were not satisfactory.\n\nThe grapefruit slice was appetizing-looking but bland. It should have been sweeter and wetter so I'm not sure how long ago it had been cut. The orange slice had a distinct taste and smell of off-ripeness. \n\nLastly the frittata while comprised of a promising blend of ingredients did not serve my palette due to its dryness and lack of flavor. The onion inside included bits of skin which should have been discarded.\n\nThe meal was somewhat enjoyable but revisited me in a stomach ache causing me to consider the quality of cleanliness of the ingredients. I'm not sure if I could recommend this particular plate at Simply Red and am curious about how it was prepared.\n" u"Simply Red serves simply the best breakfast I've had in Ithaca! Seriously amazing. \n\nWe were a bit intimidated to venture out to a spa resort for food afraid it would be like crashing a hotel breakfast and the posh interior nearly confirmed our fears. But once seated and served by the super attentive staff we eased into a fantastically indulgent pampering. \n\nThe first thing to arrive was a truly heavenly yogurt parfait featuring loads of fresh fruit chocolate chips nuts and a yummy cinnamon granola. That was followed by a basket of warm pastries served with a sweet butter. Divine. And so filling I could have walked away happy then and there. But then I would have missed out on the biggest treat of all: oatmeal crusted french toast with fresh strawberries drizzled with a brown sugar cream. Wow wow and wow! My partner was equally happy with his classic breakfast of eggs bacon taters and toast. \n\nIt felt like a real splurge but at $11.95 per person for everything including drinks it's actually the bargain of the century. And afterwards we were happy to walk off some of that grub by exploring the woodland trails that wrap around the gorgeous grounds. Such a satisfying start to our Saturday and one we're looking forward to repeating again soon.\n" u"Pros: service cute outside decor\nCons: food\n\nMy friend and I came here for Saturday brunch not to be confused with breakfast apparently.  Breakfast (7:30-10:30 AM) and brunch (11:00-?) is basically lunch.  She ordered eggs benedict over crab risotto and I ordered the frittata with artichoke asparagus goat cheese and shallot.  Her eggs benedict ($14) was mediocre at best-- the hollandaise was thick and gloppy the risotto was overcooked.  All in all it was way too rich; she could hardly eat half of it.  My frittata ($10) was overcooked and the vegetables were chopped far too large.  The only flavor came from the goat cheese and I ended up having to eat it with ketchup to get through it.  To add insult to injury we both felt sick to our stomachs afterward and neither of us are the picky eater/finicky stomach type.\n\nSummary: bad food overpriced.  You're better off at Cafe Dewitt Northstar or Carriage House for atmosphere...or even the Lincoln St Diner for food.\n" u'I had waited a long time to dine at Simply Red at La Tourelle.  A few months ago I purchased a gift certificate on Restaurants.com excited that Simply Red was one of the featured restaurants.  I had heard rave reviews about their Sheldrake location and I expected that the quality would carry over to their restaurant at La Tourelle.\n\nMy boyfriend and I showed up at the resort and were seated within a few minutes.  We ordered our drinks and were getting ready to order our brunch entrees when the waiter noticed my folded up gift certificate on the table.  He said "If that is a gift certificate from Restaurants.com we do not honor those here".  No explanation just told me to get back in touch with the website to complain.  This was disappointing and unexpected as this was the whole reason for coming to the restaurant and we definitely would have gone to Sheldrake\'s Simply Red instead.  In any case we decided to stay and have a nice brunch since we were already there.\n\nI ordered the Crab and Shrimp Risotto and Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend ordered the Classic Breakfast with scrambled eggs.  The food came relatively quickly within 10 or 15 minutes.  My plate had a few items on it - orange and grapefruit slices hashbrowns and the eggs benedict.  The hashbrowns were all burnt on one side - they had been positioned with the unburnt side up but when I flipped them over they were charred.  The risotto was mushy and bland with one or two small pieces of shrimp.  The eggs were over-poached with practically hard yolks.\n\nMy boyfriend\'s eggs were dry and the sausages tasted like hot dogs.\n\nOverall really not a great experience.  We could have easily cooked better food ourselves and it was a real let down considering the quality of food I had expected at Simply Red.  I would not recommend going to Simply Red at La Tourelle and especially do not go if you have a gift certificate - apparently they don\'t accept those.\n' u'I initially came to La Tourelle Resort and Spa for my interest in the "Simply Red Bistro." I can\'t cook to save my life but I watch all the "chef shows." Chef Samantha Izzo appeared on the TV show "Chopped" and I found her work creative. I had the Saturday morning brunch and what a treat it was! I ordered the Chorizo and Creamy Herb Polenta. My mouth is watering as I write. This dish consists of a dense "cake" of polenta topped with a lovely perfectly cooked poached egg surrounded by delicious slices of chorizo and fresh asparagus spears and covered with a buttery hollandaise. The portion was manageable - not overwhelming - with a perfect marriage of flavors. My hub had the Mama Red\'s Giant Mexican Burrito. He dug in and never looked up - a sure sign of excellence! Take the word "giant" seriously. Too many ingredients to list so see it for yourself: http://www.simplyredbistro.com/\nOur waitress Alicia was a true professional and helped us narrow down our choices. (Note to self: must come back and try everything on the menu.) We will return.\n' u"I work on Sundays so I'm always missing out on brunch which makes me sad because brunch is the ultimate meal.  Why more restaurants don't do their Sunday brunch on Saturday as well we'll never know.  but this is beside the point.\n\nWhenever I do manage to get a Sunday off brunch is the first item of business.  Simply Red recently opened up shop in Danby as the restaurant for La Tourelle - the inn and spa.   This is a second location for them in addition to their restaurant at Sheldrake - and since I have long been a fan of Simply Red (mostly because of their fried chicken!) and because La Tourelle is close to home for me I had been anxious to give their brunch a try.\n\nThe service was great and I loved the big cushy and super comfortable chairs.  I was able to snuggle in and let myself hide from the real world a little longer that morning.  I like the atmosphere there despite it's being a hotel restaurant.  \n\nThe brunch came with pastries which were totally unecessary because the brunch portions were truly enormous.  but hey everyone likes pastries so I won't complain.  I ordered the crab and shrimp eggs benedict which was absolutely to die for.  I think this plate had to have been 4000+ calories - it was just swimming in the richest most delicious hollaindaise sauce I had ever had.  My husband ordered the giant burrito which was indeed made for a giant - and was spicy messy and yummy.\n\nThe brunch was also very reasonably priced - we each had coffee juice and at least three times as much food as a person probably should eat for breakfast and well honestly I don't remember what the bill came to but we were both impressed that it wasn't a more expensive brunch.  \n\nSo now I am plotting to take off more Sundays so that I can eat the Simply Red brunch again.  In the meantime you should go and eat brunch there for me - it makes me so sad when restaurants stop doing their wonderful brunches (I'll never forget you Maxies brunch!  Or you Just a Taste brunch!).  Support the brunch!!\n\n(I should note that I also enjoy the lunches at Simply Red - I guess given the near complete lack of good brunch in Ithaca their brunch seemed most notable to me at the moment.  but the crab cakes for lunch are quite fantastic fyi)\n" u'My parents boyfriend and I just went to Simply Red to have brunch for Father\'s Day. This was our first time going to Simply Red at LaTourelle. When we arrived there was a big reunion going on so parking was crazy. We parked all the way past the old tennis court that was converted into a parking lot. We began the walk up and I have to admit that we were more than a little confused about where exactly the bistro was located. Maybe we missed signs because of all the reunion signs and people walking around but I didn\'t see anything telling us that Simply Red Bistro was even located here. Even when we pulled in I didn\'t see a sign saying Simply Red Bistro was there - the main signs said John Thomas LaTourelle & August Moon Spa. We went all the way around to the front to walk in the "main" entrance and saw the Bistro off to the left.\n\nOur waitress came over and greeted us immediately. She asked right away what we would like to drink and pitchers of water were already placed on our table. We all opted for coffee and our waitress even thought to ask if we all preferred cream at which point I was able to tell her I would like milk not cream. Normally I have to ask special for milk so it was a nice change to not have to ask. However when we began to pour glasses of water for ourselves my boyfriend noticed one of the glasses still had lipstick residue from the last customer on it. We had to ask for a new glass which was unfortunate but at least he noticed before we drank out of it!  I thought the menu had a decent variety although it was small. My mom boyfriend and I all got the frittata while my dad got their Eggs Benedict (served with some kind of seafood I didn\'t pay attention because I don\'t really eat seafood). I have to admit that I made my food decision hastily as I felt a little rushed and was on the fence between the frittata and their Classic Breakfast. Now I wish I had stuck with my original instinct to get the Classic Breakfast.\n\nOur food was out very quickly and the frittata was covered with salad greens. Also stuck under the greens was one half slice of orange one half slice of grapefruit and one half of a strawberry. I could just seem some potatoes poking out from the greens so I decided to transfer my greens over to my side plate. I quickly passed off the orange and grapefruit to my boyfriend and ate the strawberry. My boyfriend said the orange slices were about at the end of their life which is kind of sad for an upscale bistro.\n\nI ate the potatoes first and they were quite good. There was a whole garlic clove in with everyone\'s serving with potatoes which was nice (we love garlic!). Next I moved on to the frittata. It had asparagus shallots and artichokes in it. The artichoke pieces were too big I thought as it was hard to cut a nice bite size piece of the frittata without fighting with the artichoke to cut it apart. The asparagus on the other hand was chopped up into tiny pieces. There were shallots as well but it seemed like the papery skin was not removed as I pulled out a few pieces that looked just like the outside of an onion. The frittata was decent. The salad greens were good. They were in a vinaigrette type dressing. Over all the meal was tasty but not the best brunch I\'ve ever had. I think I would\'ve been much happier with the Classic Breakfast as I\'m a picky eater. I was also slightly disappointed that there were no dessert options or maybe they weren\'t told to us. It may seem weird to have dessert at brunch but I am a dessert girl and would\'ve loved to have some dessert. Especially since we were dining at 11:30 and this was one meal in the place of 2 meals so a little dessert would\'ve been nice.\n\nI think next time I\'ll try Simply Red Bistro at Sheldrake Winery instead.\n\nErin says...you rock (mostly)!\n' u"We've stayed at La Tourelle a few times and we've always loved it but our most recent stay included two breakfasts at Simply Red. It's kind of a bummer to know what we missed out on during our other stays. Everything from the omelets to the breakfast pastries is absolutely delicious and unique. Our service was wonderful too. Our server gave us great advice on what to do in the area. I can't recommend this place highly enough. Be sure to go there for breakfast if you have a chance.\n" u"My fiance and I come here for brunch almost everytime I'm in town.  We love coming for the prix fixe menu that includes pastries a parfait or fruit salad and the 'main' meal.  I always end up getting the parfait followed by the oatmeal encrusted french toast.  (The fruit salad is pretty basic.)  I like mixing up the parfait so that its consistent-I'm not the biggest fan of greek yogurt but its a nice tang when mixed with the crunchy granola and sweet fruit and chocolate chips.  The french toast is delicious.  Again I love that there is a play of textures with the soft toast tangy cream cheese drizzle fresh strawberries and crisp oatmeal crust.  The beau has gotten various items on the menu depending on what he was interested in that morning.  He's been fairly happy with everything he's tried but he usually ends up munching on a fair portion of my french toast one he's done with his meal.\n" u'One of the great joys of the travelling life is an unexpectedly great meal. After being trapped in the one-way system in Ithaca for an eternity and then finding most of the downtown restaurants closed on Mondays things gastronomic looked a bit desperate. Fortunately the Yelp app picked up Simply Red located a few miles out of town. The Bistro is the house restaurant for a beautifully located old hotel (La Tourelle - great valley views). The dining room has a vaguely mid-European feel enhanced by the stunning stained glass ceiling. Promisingly the lunch menu was also quite simple in the Euro style (soups salads some interesting sandwiches and a "themed" set lunch - in this case Chimmichurri!). Everything we ordered (bean & leek soup house cured salmon veggie quiche frisee and dill salad brisket on kummelweck & local cheeses) was simply prepared healthy and fantastically fresh tasting. Paired with outstanding German-style Finger Lakes wines this really was an excellent surprise and terrific value. Much kudos to chef Izzo (who clearly survived her Food Network experience in fine form) for her use of local ingredients in an honest and unpretentious way\n']
67.Hai Hong Restaurant,[u'I went to Hai Hong for dinner with my two friends. Nice and quiet ambience probably because we had an early dinner. Ordered Crispy Chicken with Garlic and Steamed Fish (Wild Caught) with Garlic and Soy Sauce. We were first served fried wonton and salty sauce. Then 15 minutes later the main dishes came. Both were delicious and quiet authentic. My favorite dish was the steamed fish. Very fresh as advertised succulent and cooked just right although the sauce was a little too salty. \n\nI would definitely come back. Hai Hong is a very good place for those who want to experience realauthentic Chinese food. I would say this is the best Asian restaurant on campus.\n' u'Fantastic!  Food was delicious  service impeccable. The server was the perfect combination of attentive without hovering and she knew the menu and made spot on recommendations.  Linen napkins and tablecloths but so relaxed. Pricing is most reasonable. ...we ate for two days from the leftovers. Loved the dim sun. Try it!\n' u"Cantonese food! This restaurant is the only place to get Cantonese-style dishes in Ithaca and they're pretty decent at it. I've been here a handful of times throughout this past year whenever I needed some Cantonese-style barbecue which I can't seem to find anywhere else nearby. It's not really a cha chaan teng though so don't come here expecting HK cafe food or drinks. Their regular menu has rice and noodle plates and on the weekends they do dim sum (though not like a real dim sum place).\n\nTheir prices are high though even more so than the other Asian places in town which is its biggest drawback. Expect to pay $10+ for plates which would only cost $5-6 in California.\n\nThe owner is pretty cool. He loves talking to the customers and I think I heard him try speaking French with someone once.\n" u'Staff is incredible! They will make you feel at home. The food is very good and healthy! No msg.\n' u"The food are expensive and ugly! Not tasty at all. I think they are using a wrong way trying to make Cantonese food but fail. Sorry but that's the worst Chinese food I had in ctb.\n" u"As someone from New Jersey where there are a LOT of places to go for Dim Sum I found Hai Hong a great place to get my craving fix. It's not the best I've ever had but it's certainly not bad. The prices are pretty insane though. In NYC or NJ Dim sum runs about $2.50 on average per dish. It's $4.99 here... Way too expensive to eat by yourself... and the quality of the food is certainly not worth the price. But as an occasional treat there really is no where else within 50 miles...\n" u'2-Star Dim Sum Restaurant. I was really disappointed in this place in particular their dim sum. My friend and I were craving some traditional chinese food this weekend. We decided to stopped there for their dim sum. The dim sum was expensive ($16 for 3 plates) and the portions were much smaller than other places that I have been to. That would not have been a problem except that the dim sum was clearly frozen and reheated which shows in the taste/texture. AVOID THIS PLACE for DIM SUM.\n\nDisclaimer: I have not had their other food so I cannot comment on it.\n' u"Come here Sat-Sun 11am-3pm for the only dim sum offered in Ithaca. The prices are higher than you would find in large cities and the portions are on the smaller side as well. Unfortunately you also won't be able to point at things rolling by you in carts which is half the fun of going to a dim sum restaurant. However the dim sum here is good enough to satisfy your cravings for dumplings BBQ pork buns taro fish balls and various other Cantonese appetizers. Its not as good as the best places in NYC or Monterrey Park but we should just be grateful that we have a decent dim sum place. Mediocre dim sum is still very tasty! Its best to get here around noon or earlier as the place really fills up by 12:30.\n\nDuring the weekdays this place sells just OK food. The lunch specials are reasonably priced but I think the quality has kind of gone down hill so I prefer to only come here on weekends for the dim sum.\n\nTL;DR - skip this restaurant on weekdays (2 stars) and come for the dim sum from 11-3 on weekends (4 stars). This is the best Cantonese Style Chinese Restaurant in Ithaca (for spicy Szechuan food go to Spicy Asian on rt. 13)\n" u'Dim sum in Ithaca! And not bad dim sum at that. Given if this was in a large city it would probably need to up the anti a bit but given the circumstances the food is good and variety is considerable. Taro pies are especially delicious.\n' u"Generally filthy food. I've seen scraps of hair and kitchen waste more than once. Prices are on par with nearby eateries and taste is not bad. But it just isn't possible to unsee what I've come across here in my day.\n" u"If the prices were $1-$2 cheaper for entrees this would've been a 5 for me.\n\nThe owner was our server and he was very nice and very talkative which was nice for lunch. He brought us water and took our orders promptly. Our meal came out in a reasonable amount of time as well as our appetizer.\n\nI ordered the Hong Kong Chow Fun because I love the wide noodles and this did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful and everything was cooked perfectly.\n\nWe ordered the Dumplings for an appetizer and they took a bit longer because we ordered the juicy pork ones but our server let us know of this in advance so it was no big deal at all. They were very delicious and very juicy. The meat inside was great and the outside cooked and steamed perfectly.\n\nOverall I will definitely be coming back for lunch! Like I said though don't expect to be paying less than $10 for lunch here but as long as your okay with that then this is definitely one of the better Chinese cuisine places I've been to here in Ithaca.\n" u'Food was fairly good but service was a bit slow as there was only 1 waiter at the time.\n' u"glutinous rice steamed chicken is so good which is wrapped by lotus leaf. Don't miss this one when u order the dim sum.\n" u'The food is really good--just a bit pricier than I would like!\n' u"Who knew Cantonese food in Ithaca could rival NYC. This was a fantastic Chinese restaurant with awesome service. Thomas our server was nice funny and very informed he made this experience go from good to great real fast. We had the sizzling rice with chicken and ate it all up. I highly recommend eating here. Ask Thomas for reconditions he's extremely happy to help. You feel a part of this family restaurant once you walk in the door. Let me put it this way we gave him a close to 100% tip.\n" u"Yum!\n\nThis place is pretty good. They have dim sum (yum) and typical Chinese food dishes. It's right next door to Vietnam Restaurant (and owned by the same people I believe; the restaurants are connected and share a bathroom).\n\nIt's nothing crazy delicious but decor is nice so you could bring a date here. It's just another Asian food option in Collegetown. Try it. Or not.\n" u'For an ithaca restaurant:\n\n+1 chinese authenticity/taste\n+1 variety\n+1 overall service\n+1 aesthetics\n -1 price\n\nBest Chinese food by far in Ithaca though expect to spend ~$20.\n' u"The weekend dim sum brunch is really great! It's amazing that you get to try so many different kinds of dishes in one meal! My favorites are the egg tarts shrimp dumplings sesame balls and congee. It's pretty authentic Cantonese food and it tastes especially great after I haven't eaten Chinese food for so long. The line might get very long after 12:30 for weekend brunch so get there early.\n" u'This is not your typical dim sum where Asian ladies push carts around. Dim sum was ordered off a menu  food is an average (some of the items are from frozen :-) and little pricy.\n' u"Maybe it was just coincidental that our food wasn't very good. After a lot of visits to Asian Noodle House two doors down my boyfriend and I were not terribly impressed with Hai Hong. (This was about two years ago and we haven't been back.)\n\nThe food was much pricier than Asian Noodle and not as good (admittedly Asian Noodle is not the pinnacle of quality but we'd had some good luck with certain dishes). The service was more professional but much MUCH slower and it took an entire hour to get our food (and unfortunately we had plans to see a show afterward).\n\nI know it's unhelpful but I can't remember what dishes we got. I believe one was chicken and one was beef. I put it out of mind pretty quickly because I felt it was not worth remembering. Fair to say though that it's much higher quality than a place like Apollo. I would be willing to come here and give it another chance sometime.\n"]
167.Taco Bell,[u'Slowest service ever.  On multiple occasions in line for at least ten minutes from placing order to receiving food in drive through. The food is always hot and fresh though.\n' u"Bleh. I realize this is a Taco Bell and not Chipotle/Moe's/Mighty Taco or anything roughly approximating real food. But... when food is reheated and then left out to get cold then reheated again the result has a certain je ne sais quo that wouldn't even appeal to the dankest 4th meal fanboy.\n" u'If I could give no stars I would traveling for the holidays got 25 minutes longer because of these stellar people! Hate to say anything bad about people working at a fast food establishment but wow....rise up and revolt against your crummy manager that has clearly never given you one day of training!  Not only was the drive thru worker snippy but there seemed to be an even bigger line inside of obviously not happy customers get it together people!\n' u'So I and a friend go to get tacos for the first time from this location. The associate at this Taco Bell  was nasty  rude and obnoxious .Yes I understand people work hard for little pay but if I had customers who didn\'t know what to get rather than rudely brush them off with sarcasm I would make "recommendation" on something they could try from the menu. \nSorry Sir! but I will make sure I never come to this location or any Taco Bell. Now I\'m 100% certain the rumor of associate not hand washing at this location has to be true.\n' u'service is so slow drive through with only one car ahead is 25 .min long thing I guess\n' u'Very nice employee at drive through but service was slow as can be! We thought we would buzz right through for a cold drink but never thought with a single car in front of us that it would take 10 minutes.\n' u"Unbearably slow. It doesn't matter what time of day you go you're better off going to wegmans and picking up a DYI taco kit because this place takes so long. I've never seen a place so incompetently run. I suspect it's because Ithaca is a small town and there aren't many options here they figure they can get away with it. Whatever the case may be I won't be going here again. Twice *twice* I have had waits so long that I've had weight in excess of 20 minutes both at different times of day. I've shut my car down in the drive through because k burn so much gas waiting on a simple order of maybe I or 3 items. What are they even doing in there? Why does it take this long to make me a Doritos locos taco? The food is consistent with other taco bells which is to say poor but that's what you expect from Taco Bell. But when fast food is not fast but only low quality the purpose is defeated. Go across the stews and save some time at chipotle. If it's too late go to Wendy's\n" u'The people who give one star reviews dont realize taco bell is not the place to go for gourmet food lol. For s taco bell late night Mexican food. Its great. The workers are nice & the fiod is good for what its worth lol\n' u'I love this Taco Bell especially since they redid the inside dining area. My orders are always correct and done in a timely fashion. There have been numerous times where I have brought several lists from coworkers and have held up the line. They were still kind and helpful regardless of the growing line and once I get through they seem to rebound no problem. Very friendly staff and very clean for a Taco Bell. :)\n' u'I went to Cornell for a Year. Everyone knows T-bell is the best after a night out but this bell is the worst I have ever been too. God awful. \n\nEvery time I went they either messed up my order gave me broken tacos left food out of my bag or were out of some kind of addition (lettuce Cheese Chicken)... \n\nJust pure awful.\n' u"All taco bells are a dime a dozen but this one is pretty crappy first off don't buy the buffalo chicken burritos because they put way too much sour cream second the place is usually very unclean so don't on eating in on the bright side though they make awesome churros and its a good place for late night snacks\n" u'I love Taco Bell; just not here in Ithaca. Horrible. After going there several times. They seem to always screw up my order.\n' u'Good for late night food on the go. I like the #7 w/ chicken.\n' u'Ithaca T-Bell is great. Go there at night and get a lot of nasty crap. They will make Cheesy Gordita Crunches on demand whether they are on the menu or have been off of it for six months. It doesn\'t matter the CGC is always there in their hearts. This is one of the few Taco Bell locations that I\'ve never heard of anyone getting sick from so that\'s a plus. When you go at night watch out for the guy with the high pitched voice. Sometimes I address him with "yes ma\'am" and "thank you ma\'am" not knowing who it is then I get really embarrassed when I pull up and realize that it\'s a guy.\n']
129.Pizza Aroma,[u'Absolutely the best pizza in town in my opinion. A bit different from classic NY pizza but while most of the Ithaca pizza places try and fail to imitate NY pizza Pizza Aroma succeeds in creating pizza that tastes good- including tasteful crust good sauce and really unique toppings like avocado black bean and tortellini.\n' u'This pizza spot is Salvadoran run and serves papusas in addition to pizza. Unfortunately the papusas are not made fresh to order and are instead heated in a microwave making them pretty terrible. Stick to the pizza here.\n' u"I've been eating pizza here for over 10 years and it's for a reason the pizza is good. \nThe crust is crunchy the sauce is great and they have vegan pizza! \nNot sure why others are complaining especially about the staff the staff serve you pizza and say thanks. And that's good enough for me.\n" u"Found animal leg in gourme pizza.\n\nAt lunch on weekend I stopped by for some lunch and ordered 1 slice of gourmet pizza (the mixed and colorful veggies) for 4.50  and after I eat it for 1 from 3 of the slice and I found a long piece of animal leg in pizza (leg with hair with length is about 1.7 c.m.) and start to throw up right away. I show that piece to the owner he act like he did not see it bit the piece is really long and stuck in the tissue paper. I asked the owner for any responsibility and he said it was a piece of veggie and not take any response at all. But it smell disgusting and make me throw up.  All my entire life it was never happened before. I was also a restaurant server before for so many years and  I am sure that's an animal legs. So just be careful.\n\nNormally I was a regular customers I purchased 2  t shirt of Ithaca is our town with this shop before and always stopped by for veggie pizza pepperoni pizza or cheese one and like this place to hang out  but surely not anymore. I hope you done your career well with honesty and responsibility to all of your local customer who supported you like me :)\n" u'Pizza was good not great.  Service was fast!\n' u'I\'ve just returned from Pizza Aroma for the third time since moving to town and I have to say that I hate having made this my special-occasions spot because I\'d be here almost daily otherwise.\n\nI\'m from California so I\'m not partial to crust style but this place has thin slices you can appreciate. The pies aren\'t too oily and my empty boxes are proof. At the same time the slices aren\'t too stiff so if you really need to do a lengthwise fold you can. Any floppiness will most likely be from the weight of the toppings.\n\nFrom the simplest flavor combos like white garlic to the more unexpected such as bbq chicken and veggie the flavor\'s never been "too much" in any way. There\'s always just the right amount of sauce cheese and toppings. And if you\'re on a similar frequency as I am and see the pies being made from scratch you know that goodness and gratitude are going into your order both of which enhance the taste.\n\nLast but not least my food has always been ready within the time quoted: less than 30 minutes. Take that [rhymes with Poconos]!\n\nThere are other pizza places in town and I doubt they disappoint but I keep returning to Aroma instead of trying them out. Let\'s hope this public statement of bias embarrasses me enough to branch out.\n\nNow if you\'ll excuse me I have some pizza to finish eating.\n' u'Fantastic pizza.  Family of 5 with many different tastes including a vegan and all of us leaving happy happy :)  many slices to choose from and all were great.   Calzones- we got a chicken parm & lasagna- were excellent.   Vegetarian pizza even had a \'cheese\' and was "best ever"\n' u"The girl behind the counter was cold almost as cold as my cold tamale with a giant black hair weaved into it. The tamale had too much masa it was soggy and cold. Also my tomato bbq pizza was completely flavorless and undercooked yet burned at the same time. I'm disappointed because the sign stated best pizza of 2015.. I guess 2016 is a different story.\n" u"They had a huge assortment of slices to choose from all ranging from fresh to probably pretty old. Either way you'll want to get it warmed up and I'd recommend getting it to-go. \nI got a cheese slice extra crispy. It was edible with no specific highlights a low light however was the cornmeal used on the crust. It detracted from the overall slice and I was not a fan. \n\nStill looking for that great slice of pizza in Ithaca.\n" u'I\'ve been anxious to eat the food here as I am Salvadoran and I\'ve been craving food from the motherland.  Not only did I order pupusas and pasteles but I also ordered a pizza (I know gluttony at its finest) as a colleague highly recommended the pizza here.  \n\nWhere do I begin... How can you call the ethnic food authentic if it\'s not even made to order!  I have never been to a Salvi restaurant where they don\'t make the food to order.  The pupusas and pasteles were refrigerated and then microwaved.  They only make TWO kinds of pupusas: beans and cheese and revueltas which is made with pork.  They don\'t even offer plain cheese pupusas. WTF! The pupusas are small thin and taste old.  The salsa was greasy.  How can salsa be greasy?!?! The curtido (pickled cabbage) was pretty good though.  As for the pasteles they tasted OK.  I\'ve never had pasteles with corn peas and lima beans.  It had so many vegetables I couldn\'t even taste the chicken.  AND where\'s the Cola Champan horchata or fresco de tamarindo???  You can\'t have so called "authentic" Salvadoran food without authentic Salvadoran drinks! \n\nI ordered a pizza with extra cheese pepperoni and fresh basil.  It looked bomb but tasted just OK.   The crust is different; it tasted a bit grainy (I guess that\'s an acquired taste). The marinara sauce lacked a little something.  Unfortunately I will continue on my quest to find the best pizza in Ithaca.\n\nEssentially my three stars review is for the pizza because the Salvi food is garbage.\n' u"Nothing special but not bad at all considering Ithaca's weak pizza game. Their pizza is unique. It's thick with a ton of toppings. They even had a pizza with one pizza on the bottom and one on top with a lot of toppings in the middle. Hadn't tried their other food but their pizza isn't bad but it's not bad.\n" u'The best pizza in Ithaca in my experience. Apparently others think otherwise but I think they deserve a five-star review.\n' u"This place is awesome. A wide range of delicious food friendly staff and very generous portions. Way more than just a pizza shop.I don't eat cheese so they make me an eggplant sub stuffed with vegetables. They also have Latin entrees and a full menu. It's delicious.\n" u'This place has the best quality toppings on their pizza in Ithaca and is one of the few places you can get vegan cheese pizza if you are in to that sort of thing. I personally do not like their cornmeal dusted crust but thats a personal preference. My biggest complaint is that they should really brown their cheese more.\n\nAs for the El Salvadorian food its just ok not nearly as good as any of the places in California.\n' u'One of my favorite places but delivery accuracy is hit or miss.\n' u'Tasty vegan loaded veggie pizza. \nOnions peppers tomatoes olives spinach you name it. \n\nVery casual & inexpensive for a quick bite to eat & go.\n' u'Note: I just moved up to Ithaca after living in NYC so this review is quite biased.  \n\nMy expectations of the pizza here were immediately thrown out the window upon entering and hearing Spanish music being blasted.   Here\'s the thing the pizza here isn\'t bad.  They have plenty of varieties which have all been sitting out all day.   I asked the woman behind the counter which pie came out most recently and she said they all came out at the same time.  That\'s physically impossible unless they have 8 more pizza ovens in the back.  I got the meat pie slice (pepperoni sausage and "meatball" stuffed slice) and the chicken and bacon slice. They were better than much of the pizza is in Ithaca but mediocre in the world of pizzas.  So far Sals has the best slice in town but that\'s barely a step above Mi Famiglia in the city.\n' u"Overall: This place has very good pizza and it is probably one of the best places for it in Ithaca. However avoid the Salvadorian food; it simply isn't worth it. My rating is based only on the Italian- American dishes.\n\nThe specifics: \nItalian- American food- I have ordered a few different pizza pies from this place but my go to is the Fresh Mozzarella Pie and it is quite good. All the pies that I have had seem to have quality ingredients. The corn-meal dusted crust is crispy and just the right bulk and it stands up to the most hefty toppings. The red sauce is thick and chunky and not too tart and not too sweet and that is how I like it.  The garlic knots are crispy and well flavored though a little bit greasy and unnecessarily dusted with corn meal. The calzones are enormous for their price and the quality of the ingredients is like the pizza very good. I am a fan of the Popeye and vegetarian calzones; the crusts are crispy and the filling is generous.\n\nFrankly I don't get my fellow Downstaters (Long Islanders NYC folk etc) pizza elitism or being thrown off by Latin music playing there; you either make a good pizza or you don't and this place belongs in the former group. \n\nThe Salvadorian food- I could write essays on this. I ordered a chile relleno plato tipico. It wasn't a poblano or a hatch chili. It was a green bell pepper. There was no cheese and there was no meat. The veggies were those you'd usually find in a cheap frozen mix and they were mixed with mashed potatoes. The whole dish was rather flavorless. The rice seemed to be reheated as did the beans which were oversalted. The chicken that I ordered on the side was likewise rather flavorless; all that I could taste was the animal fat which is an acquired taste that I sadly did not acquire having grown up in a vegetarian household. \n\nThe service- I usually order via grubhub. If there is an issue with my order they usually call promptly and are fair regarding substitutions if they've run out of an ingredient. The person who handled my orders was courteous and friendly as was the deliveryman.\n" u'So good! I have had plenty of vegan pizza and this was the best! Oh how I missed "foldy" pizza. 2 types of vegan cheese.\n' u'Pizza Aroma was the third take out place I tried after moving to Ithaca. After our first bites my girlfriend and I smiled. "It\'s not bad!" We were so excited. Then we took our second bites. "Not good but it\'s not bad." \n\nPretty much sums it up. Mediocre pizza but potentially one of the better options around. I\'m hoping not. There\'s gotta be better pizza in this town.\n']
150.Franny‚Äôs Food Truck,[u'Possibly the best food now available on Cornell\'s campus Franny\'s is a food truck located behind Sibley Hall Cornell\'s architecture school. The "truck" is actually a trailer that turns into a glowing box at night and its sleek minimalist aesthetic would be completely at home in a hip design district of a major world city. Its cuisine is almost at the same level. Good noodle dishes and passable dosas (a rarity in Ithaca) make for a nice blend of pan-Asian dishes with some Mexican options as well including a delicious hibiscus agua fresca.\n\n Nothing here is as good as you might find in an "authentic" Vietnamese Indian or Mexican restaurant but it\'s really really good for a food truck in rural upstate New York that\'s making a stab at preparing dishes from all three cuisines. The opening hours (til 9 which is really convenient for those who work late on campus) are helpful too.\n' u"Not really sure why this has any bad reviews. Interesting ethnic menu quick service high-quality food. Arguably best food truck on campus. Summer rolls pork dumplings horchata banh mi pork buns and dosa dillas all really good - can't go wrong at Franny's.\n" u"This place has weird timing (not sure if they have a website). They'll close in the afternoon even though the employees are found chit-chatting inside the truck. It's also placed in a weird location. If you come between 3-3:45 it might be closed. You can either wait for it to open or give up on eating there. They do make yummy dosadillas though.\n"]
199.McDonald‚Äôs,[u'Drive-Thru OK - just avoid at dinner time if at all possible.\n\nInside the restaurant is disorganized mess most anytime you go.\n\nThe one in Dryden or in Lansing is more highly recommended. \n\nFood is ok when you get it... sometimes its actually "FAST".\n' u"This is by far the DIRTIEST McDonalds I have ever been to. Consistently filthy over the last three years. \n\nThe Triphammer Rd McD's is nice and clean. \n\nI wish the employees at both places earned enough for dental care.\n" u"This is the worst McDonald's. Long lines inattentive employees dirty often out of certain types of food. Go to the McDonald's near the mall instead.\n" u"This is the grossest McDonalds I have ever been to.  I was here on business and needed a quick bite after a long day.  I walked in and there was trash all over the floor.  The floor clearly hadn't been mopped in God knows how long.  I then placed my order to go.  No biggie.  After a few minutes I noticed that everyone behind me in line was getting food before me.  After about 15 minutes I asked what the deal was with my food.  The kid said they accidentally deleted my order.  About another 10 minutes goes by and still no food.  Their is the gross dirty Meth head lady working the orders.  She kept deleting my orders then cussing at everyone about why the orders are messed up.  She then began yelling to the back of the kitchen about how she only had 3 cigarettes left.  Finally my food was coming up.  This chick goes to put the fries in the bag then F__ King coughs all over them then wipes her hands on her shirt!!!... I was done.  I literally almost blew chunks all over the place... I have been to some dirty places but this was beyond my level of tolerance.  I immediately asked for a refund and to talk to a manager.  The manager wasn't any better than the meth lady.  He gave me a refund.  The lady called me a dick.  I laughed and that was that.  My next order of business is to call Corporate head quarters because this was not right by any means.  Stay away from this location.\n" u"This is one of the WORST McDonalds I have been to. I ordered an oatmeal it didn't come w any of the toppings that they come w when I went in and complained they said they put whole apples in the bag and when people ask for oatmeal with apples they break them up and mush them w their hands\n" u"One of the best McDonalds I have been to.  Yes it's McDonalds...don't come here expecting a gourmet meal.  However it's more than sufficient when you're in a bind.\n\nMy mornings are always brightened up by the amazingly talented and friendly Marilyn working the drive thru line.  She is the biggest asset this location has--her exceptional hospitality makes me leave in a better mood than when I pulled in. \n\nFive stars for Marilyn.\n" u"LIED TO CUSTOMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAt Drive through\n\nAt Triphammer location I ordered 2 boxes of double quater pound but  I just got 2 order of regular quater pond for 2 boxes. Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe seller had no knowledge about products and what they sell at all!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nDon't wanna go back!!!!!!!\n" u'I worked at many McD over the years so maybe my idea of them is alittle on the difficult side. This location is very poor the building is old and decrepit. Management of this restaurant is not good either; service is markably slower burgers are sloppily built and cashiers are very white trashy looking. This is not acceptable McD quality.\n' u'THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE "CONE"\nor what us humans (and hopeless addicts) call a vanilla ICE CREAM CONE\nformerly known as mcdonald\'s frozen yogurt until it was revealed\n\nthat it wasn\'t frozen yogurt at all.... it is:\n\nWhole milk sucrose cream nonfat milk solids corn syrup solids mono and diglycerides guar gum imitation vanilla flavor carrageenan cellulose gum vitamin A palmitate. (see:http://www.fatfreekitchen.com/junkfoods/mcdonald-ingredients.html)\n\nand it\'s not "Vanilla" it\'s Vanilla-ish or vanilla-like or more commonly vanilla-flavored. \n\nAnd it\'s not ice cream it\'s ice-cream-esque. Hence why mcdonalds simply called it a "Cone".\n\nI\'m all about simplifying-- I mean why not just call a food by it\'s shape? Seems intuitive right? I\'ll have a circle with a melted square on a bisected circle with a side of vertical lines and a diet cylinder with transparent cubes. Oh and I\'d like a deep-fried parallelogram for dessert.\nAWESOME!\n\nBut hey now that we\'ve settled all that this is review number six in my series about Frozen Yogurt.\n\nThe Fro-Down:\n\nSo even though this is not really frozen yogurt and it\'s not in the San Francisco Bay Area I feel compelled to review the Elmira Road McDonald\'s (and Triphammer Road McDonalds) in Ithaca New York because they are the genesis the alpha the initation the SEMINAL LOCATION (okay that\'s gross) of my fro-yophilia.\n\nMy mother and I agree... there is crack in the cone at mcdonalds. \nIt\'s that simple. \nThey have a vat of liquid crack cocaine and they pour the vanilla-esque creamish product in there and swirl it until it\'s cold and then they pipe it onto a cone and watch as the soccer moms and administrative assistants and truck drivers and bricklayers and hairstylists drive through the drive thru with crumbs still on their shirtfronts and blouses from the cone they just got up the road at the OTHER McDonalds and devoured on their way down the hill on route 13 or up the hill in case they are hitting the Elmira Road McDonalds\' first and then the Triphammer one.\n\nThe worst day of my life the machine was broken: at both mcDonalds.\n\nSo I drove to Dryden.\n\nI really hope this doesn\'t demean me in the eyes of you other fro-yo connoisseurs and connoisettes out there... but a person has to start somewhere... and seriously... you know you have a guilty bad-food habit you admit to no one. You love Jif peanut butter or you drink Postum... or maybe... maybe you like Goobers (either the PB&J mix in the jar OR the chocolate-covered movie theater peanuts it doesn\'t matter!) or maybe its Potted Meat you love or even... even Vienna Sausages.\n\nyeah so before you start tossing cans of spam or ambrosia salad molds at me just remember... \n\nThe Fro-Yo at McDonalds in Ithaca has crack in it.\n']
42.Circus Truck,[u'Best food truck in Ithaca. I love the seitan reuben and the breakfast burrito: both are great veggie options. Prices are extremely reasonable. Only downsides are 1) only one guy works there so if there is a huge rush you might have to wait 10 minutes for your food and 2) I wish it were open a longer range of hours. LOOOVE the Circus Truck!\n' u'Wow! What a find. My 15 year old daughter said "That was the best burger I have EVER had!" I must agree. Yummy and cheap. The pasta was wonderful as well. Drive your truck down to East Nashville. The Circus truck is welcome down south anytime!\n' u"I don't know why I waited so long to try the Circus Truck. The food here is amazing. It definitely lives up to the hype. \nSurprisingly they have a ton of vegetarian and vegan options. The owner/cook/guy also seems like he'd gladly make you anything custom you could think of. \nI had french toast and loaded vegan fries. The french toast was great but the loaded vegan fries were totally genius.\n" u"Awesome food truck. We had pasta with creamy pesto a giant breakfast burrito a kids pasta and cheese and three drinks all for $19. Super nice. Everything was fresh and tasty. We're definitely coming back.\n" u"This place just keeps rockin! Best food from a truck anywhere. Fresh and well prepared food with great care going into the ingredients.   Outstanding pasta dishes!!\n\nThis truck is open Monday-Thursday 9 AM - 2 PM and Fridays 6 PM - 3 AM. \n\nA perfect stop for breakfast/ lunch  during the week or late night munchies on Fridays.\n\nThis here foodie sez:  Don't miss out!\n" u"I used to spend a lot more for food I didn't like as well before somebody clued me in about the circus truck.  I rotate between the daily specials which are different all the time.    The pasta Alfredo is great. The burgers are great. I'm not much of a hot dog guy but he made a coney hot special that was one of the best tasting things I've ever put in my mouth.\n" u'Drove to Ithaca just for circus truck on Tuesday after taughannock falls.  We got there 2:40pm and the truck closed at 2...  The owner was nice enough to make us super delicious sandwich for 5bucks using eggplant fried onion rings super thick bacon and many other more on super crusty but soft buns. It was really yummy. Wish I could have tried others too.\n' u'This is a great food truck that serves pasta ($8-$9) sandwiches ($8-9) hot dogs pancakes ($5-$7) breakfast burritos ($5) breakfast sandwiches ($3 - $4) and much more. Now I object to the reviewer that said "fresh homemade pasta". The pasta I was served was definitely dried and from a box but the sauce is fresh and homemade so perhaps what the reviewer meant or perhaps only sometimes the circus truck makes their own pasta.\n\nI had the eggplant pasta with tomato sauce olive oil garlic shaved parmesan and fresh basil for $8 and it was very tasty. He uses a lot of extra virgin olive oil and while perhaps its a bit greasy it really hits the spot after a few cocktails glasses of wine pints of beer (and?)/or shots at any of the nearby bars. The pasta is far better than many of the sit down Italian restaurants in the Ithaca area and an unusual dish for a food truck to have. I love it. When I\'m too lazy to make my own pasta sauce from scratch I now have a place to go. After eating at places like this (and making my own pasta sauce) I can never go back to the jared stuff again.\n' u'Was fantastic! Everything tasted so good it was so reasonable. I almost felt bad it was so cheap based on the quality of food. Loved it and will be going back!\n' u"Came here while on a school visit to Ithaca. I'm a vegetarian and at the time that I came the owner was just about to go out of town and was out of a lot of menu items including Seitan. Have no fear though he offered to create for me an off the menu zucchini and spinach panini with pesto SO good and really well priced for the caliber of sandwich I received. This truck aims to please and definitely did so for me.\n" u"It's 1:30AM and you are in downtown Ithaca with a craving for an amazing breakfast burrito - what do you do?\n\nWell if you're smart you head to the Circus Truck!  This guy is turning out some serious gourmet food from his mobile kitchen with micro-batch pasta sauces made from scratch to satisfy every order and daily specials to blow your mind.  Food this good cannot be rushed so be patient and enjoy your reward.  If you are anywhere near downtown during the week for lunch or the evening for dinner on the weekends consider supporting this new local gem.\n" u'Breakfast all day long? Homemade pasta? Smorgasbords of loaded fries?  Burgers sandwiches and dogs?  Done done done and done!  Man do I miss this place!\n\nCircus Truck hangs out on the corner of Rt 13/N. Meadow and Seneca in a lot with some picnic tables and some dirt.  You might see a sign that says "Eat here" and it might have some hours on it.  You can usually get noms before 2 or 3pm and for Friday and Saturday late night.  I mean who doesn\'t want an awesome sandwich after getting boozy at Felicia\'s?\n\nFollow them on Facebook and you\'re bound to get a bombardment of delicious sounding daily specials and pictures of aforementioned items to boot.  They\'ll make you drool. I promise.  For example today\'s special is the Manslaughter Fries: sausage onion spinach cheese covered w/ homemade portabella mushroom cream sauce & fresh parsley.  If you ask nicely he\'ll make them for you tomorrow.  I ask. It\'s great.\n\nFood truckery at it\'s finest. Can\'t wait to go back and get something delicious!\n' u"I am one of the pickiest eaters alive and JP always always always accommodated me. My favorite thing to order was the pasta bolognese and the best thing about it is he makes everything from scratch in the spot so he would use only beef (no pork) and add no cheese. Also if you go closer to his closing time he always surprises you with whatever leftovers he has from the day (if any). He makes the best whipped cream I've ever had. This is one of the top things I miss about Ithaca!\n" u"Always delicious. JP has a great standard menu and makes up amazing specials everyday. If you tell him what you like he can make you something special right on the spot. His prices are reasonable his ingredients are fresh and he's a nice guy to chat with.\n" u'This food truck delivers in ways I did not expect a food truck to. You can taste the freshness of the vegetables and the daily specials make this establishment a place you\'ll want to visit every day.  One of my favorite things I\'ve ever seen was a sign outside the Circus Truck once or twice: "Homeless eat free today." Not only a place with delicious fresh food but a place with a whole lot of heart especially where it counts.\n' u"Its odd to get fresh homemade pasta from a truck (usually I'd expect greasy food) but this truck definitely delivers great food.  The alfredo sauce tasted great and was made right in front of me.  Burgers and fries (which are good) and some other items are on the menu but pasta is definitely the highlight.   The only drawbacks are the lack of seating and the somewhat out-of-the-way location.\n" u'Very tasty food freshly prepared -- plus very creative specials each day.  Really a great addition to the Ithaca food scene!\n']
194.Cayuga Lake Cruises,[u"Kinda fun and relaxing if you're with a group but not all that impressive.\n\nFood was incredibly limited. They put out some chicken wings which were not enough to serve the entire boat. When they ran out of it they brought out some flatbread which the servers only handed out to a few people. They have a bar on the lower level with a decent menu (given how small it is) but will obviously be pretty pricey.\n\nCayuga Lake is pretty scenic from a distance but it just doesn't look all that great when you're on a boat. The water was very dirty for half of the trip and by the time we got into some clear water the boat turned around and went back toward the dock. You also won't see much unless you enjoy looking at lake houses.\n" u"Being on the lake is beautiful and it's fun to see the sights but the food is awful. why in the land of an abundance of organic local food is there none of it on the menu? pre-cut baby carrots? yuck how about some local roasted or sauteed veggies? and homemade desserts. the soup was waaaaay too salty.  and Ithaca Bakery rolls would have been nice instead of the ones that come in a box from your distributor. there's no excuse for not having better food it's harvest time here! If I ever am persuaded to go again it will be for cocktails or wine only! At least they do offer some local wines.\n"]
64.The Ivy Room,[u'This is where you can find the best take out salads in Ithaca. The salad bar has a huge number of topping choices and you can have as many of them as you like. Here is a lesson in math/combinatorics for you: if there are x potential salad toppings there are 2^x possible salad combinations. I am pretty sure x is greater than 30 so that means there are at least 110 million possible salads. Some of the possible toppings are really fancy like shrimp chicken real bacon buffalo mozzarella feta blue cheese shredded hard cheeses several kinds of berries stuffed grape leaves marinated mushrooms several kinds of nuts grilled peppers all sorts of beans olives dried fruit and vegetables. That said the salads are a bit smaller than Trillium but the quality of the toppings here makes it in my opinion the better value.\n\nAt the grill for about $5 you can get a good quality omelet and home fries anytime of the day. The fries and burgers in this station are just OK. However the food in the Asian section is actually quite good. The Korean spicy beef wrap is tasty (although I wish it had a bit more veggies in it) and the noodle soup bar is a healthy and flavorful option. If I have my choices of the eateries on Cornell campus the Ivy Room is where I go.\n' u"Best place to grab food on campus. It has a wide selection and it's pretty damn good. You can always grab a place to eat too and it's usually not too crowded. And if you're lucky you'll see a disparaging handwritten note under one of the crests of the seven other Ivy League schools. Written out of envy of course.\n" u"I visit the Ivy Room quite often. It's the next biggest non-dining hall campus eatery after Trillium. \n\nOptions include:\nBuild your own salads - The variety of ingredients is amazing. They have the usual stuff plus fruits (watermelon cantaloupe honeydew strawberries blueberries grapes) avocado bacon hummus 6 kinds of cheeses banana peppers and more. It's the biggest selection of salad ingredients on campus better than the Terrace in Statler. All of it tastes very fresh. \n\nTex-Mex food - burritos nachos chicken empanadas quesadillas rice beans. The food here will definitely fill you up. The quesadillas are huge and stuffed with cheese. You can choose the ingredients you want including beef chicken refried or black beans lettuce salsa rice sour cream and guacamole. I'm a fan of the empanadas. They're crisp and have a delicious chicken and cheese filling. \n\nGrill - hamburgers fries fish sandwiches omelets. \n\nConfusion - Asian food including noodles. \n\nPizza - fairly good! Pick your slices from the pizzas available. \n\nThere's also hummus/pretzel sticks sushi sandwiches soups macaroni & cheese chili salads to go and a huge selection of drinks. By the registers there are lots of baked goodies and a freezer with ice cream bars. \n\nThe seating area is huge with windows with great views.\n" u"Overall good food prices are alright not as inflated as Trillium. Good variety but could be more healthy. Lots of space usually for ppl to sit down without waiting too long but with Cornell's population ever expanding Im happy to say I will be graduating in 4 months.\n"]
180.Goldie‚Äôs,[]
131.Denny‚Äôs,[u'Loved the new "Honey Jalape\xf1o Bacon Sriracha Burger" pretty interesting mix there. As usual the Oreo shake is as good as it gets.\n' u"New Denny's location replacing Friendly's. Place still looks brand new and has a noticeably modern interior and a variety of seating. \n\nServer seemed impatient that we needed time to decide and after finally returning to take our order informed the table that the wafflemaker was broken meaning two of us had to choose something else. Since it was still late morning this should have been told to us when we were seated to save us and her some time!\n\nWent for the French Toast instead which was spotty between burnt and mushy. Egg whites were fine sausage was fine bacon was slightly undercooked.\n\nMight try again when i'm back in the area hoping for a better experience.\n" u"I'm a little surprised by some of the negative reviews on here because I've been in this place probably a dozen times and never had a single issue. The only reason I mark it down one star is because it's Denny's and I'm not really expecting the moon here.\n\nI mostly come to Denny's to work during off hours so I try to avoid the busiest times. I don't want to sit at one of their tables for a long time if it's busy and they need it. In that approach I have found the service to be prompt and very friendly and my food has always come out very quickly.\n\nAdditionally I'm on a restrictive diet so I make lots of modifications. I have never once been griped at and my food has always come out exactly the way I've ordered it.\n\nI go to Denny's with my laptop to work because I've personally found it to be one of the best places for this in Ithaca. They have big wide comfortable booths. There are power outlets placed evenly all throughout the base of these booths. They have free wi-fi. And they're open 24 hours.\n" u"Called in advance for large out of town group. Was called back by the manager to confirm and was told extra staff would be on hand. When we arrived there was one cook and 4 servers. they where already behind and there where only a few people in the restaurant. Couldn't tell you how the food is yet because we are still waiting for over an hour and a half. \nGet it together people!!!\n" u"So it's been years since I've been to a Denny's and I was pleasantly surprised to see they've added a few things to their menu that aren't deep fried meat and cheese concoctions oh I mean Slams. There were even a few lower fat and/or vegetarian options. That said it IS Denny's. So it's not health food. \n\nService was super duper friendly but slow even on a midweek night when they were relatively empty. That was kind of a bummer. \n\nOn the plus side it's clean and tasty and kids got activity booklets and crayons to keep us all busy while we waited. :)\n" u"Tuesday morning 8:20 AM 4 waiters two tables. After 5 minutes I seated myself. After another five I got myself a menu. After another ten minutes I got up searched for a waiter to give my order to. While I'm doing that she is trying to shove a menu at me and usher me back to where I was sitting. That didn't work and I gave her my order. 30 minutes later I had two very slimy poached eggs and a cold soggy piece of toast. Denny's? Maybe but certainly not in Ithaca.\n" u"Our visit to Dennys was a mixed bag. The food was mostly decent albeit very greasy even for Dennys. The service was pretty decent. Our waitress was very nice if a little frazzled and disorganized.\n\nThe biggest disappointment were the grits. We were all craving them but they came out super late  (after the rest of our dishes had been cleared!) and were horribly undercooked. Like barely edible. Huge bummer.\n\nI hope they get better the longer they are here because I'm a big Dennys fan but I probably won't come back for a little while.\n" u'I have to give one star to write a review not worth any stars service the worst waited 40 mins for food was cold and not good this place is worse than stuckys do not stop you are better off to hold a will work for food sign and hope for the best\n' u"Horrible service. \n\nOur waitress seemed to ignore us the whole time we were there. We waited 20 mins from sitting down to seeing her for the first time. The only other time she came was to bring our food which arrived after an hour and was wrong (and in the case of the skillet undercooked). I asked for water  twice and never got it. \n\nMeanwhile I saw our waitress laughing/hanging out with other waitstaff. Which isn't a problem if you do it while you also do your job but come on.\n\nI mean it's Denny's so I'm not expecting anything crazy. Just basic courtesy or the veneer of caring about your customers would be nice.\n" u'I would give this place a 4 star rating for the service and food except for the rude and unprofessional manager named shannon.   After I brought an issue up to her her response was "oh well he should have asked who was next". She then turned and walked away.   Never addressed the issue and totally ignored the issue.   When asked to speak to her boss I was ignored.\n' u"Oh man It's been over 6 months and this place still doesn't have itself together. \nI've been back several times with mixed results. 'Mixed results' running the range from acceptable to completely mindblowingly awful. \nThe times I've gone in the evening seem to be better overall.\nWeekend brunch/lunch times have been the worst. \nThe worst offender was a vegetable skillet I received in a completely inedible state - 1/3 the size it usually is missing ingredients had a random chunk of sausage hanging out in the middle of it and stray cheese all mixed into the side of salsa. If you have food allergies stay far away.\nThe manager will ask you how your  meal was and give a discount when things are wrong. But I don't want a discount. All I want is the food I ordered in an edible state.\nI've pretty much given up on this location.\n" u"wow. Just WOW. Amazing experience at denny's last night. A couple friends and I found our tummies rumbling at an odd hour....so we thought.... DENNY'S!!!!\n" u"Some friends and I have made midnight Denny's trips multiple times and each time we have had some of the best waitresses. Tonight especially was great. Tammy was helping us and even though it was her first night she was handling 5 or so tables all by herself. She was kind and accommodating and we really appreciated her and the entire staff being their so late and serving us food.\n\nWas the food served quickly no but we were in at midnight and anyone who expects immediate service that late at night needs to calm down. We had a really lovely time and we look forward to coming back soon! Maybe we will luck out and get Tammy again!\n" u'Excellent and quick service yet again. They held the door open for my handicap companion and welcomed us. The Hearty Pecan Banana Pancake breakfast was stunningly delicious. Awesome brown sugar and pecans throughout. Moons over my hammy was amazing sandwich. Nicely seasoned. The food tasted better than the fancy schmancy $60/person brunch place we went last and much better prices here. Great and attentive staff yet again. Come during off hours.\n' u"We've been here a total of 3 times and on each occasion or orders were wrong.  On our most recent visit the area where we sat was pretty dirty.  The waitress disappeared for a long time at one point.  My eggs were cold.  I complained to the waitress and to the woman who worked the register but they didn't seem very concerned.  Won't be back there anytime soon.\n" u"This review is based on what you would hope for at Denny's (not comparing it to fine-dining restaurants):\n\nWe came in for brunch late on a Saturday morning. We were greeted quickly and received our drink order fast. Our order was taken as soon as we'd decided on what we wanted. Our requests were executed exactly as we'd asked (we made a few special requests) and our server was very very pleasant (and efficient). \n\nThis was our first visit and the service exceeded our expectations. We were there with our toddler and he was provided with crayons and paper to color on. Our meal was delivered fast and we heard the staff coordinating cooks and servers in an attempt to deliver food/service promptly. They seem to be working hard and all of the people we encountered were very pleasant.\n\nWe'll be back when we're in the mood for a quick brunch again.\n" u"Avoid this place if at all possible. What an awful experience. We were seated immediately (one of the only good points of the whole trip) but why does that matter when it takes two hours for us to leave the place and an hour for us to get our food?\n\nIt seems as if this place is understaffed but it is hard to tell. I could literally go on and on about how awful this experience was but here is just a few\n\n1) our order was taken quickly but it took a whopping ~1.5 hours to get our food. At a diner. Are they kidding?\n2) our drinks were only refilled once and in the two hours never got the water we asked for \n3) ordered an appetizer which didn't appear until the food came (which was 1.5 hours later remember?)\n4) when the food did came it was AWFUL. our appetizer was cold tough and overlooked. How can you mess up a quesadilla and queso&chips that bad? It was clear that it had been made a while ago and forgotten about. Just awful \n5) for three people we had silverware for two people. After asking twice we never got it. Had to divide up the two sets among us so we had what we needed. \n5) my chicken avocado sandwich came without avocado. And when I did get the avocado after I asked it was clearly rotten. And the waitress did not ask once to comp my meal despite this \n6) after all of this it cost over $50 for three people. Just ridiculous. \n\nThe cherry on top is that were we not the only one who experienced this. The place was packed and two people walked out while we did. If only we were smart enough to follow.\n" u"I'm giving one star because yelp doesn't allow me to give 0 stars. This has to be the most disgusting restaurant I have ever been in my life. Really unprofessional unfriendly staff. I have to wait 45 minutes for spaghetti and meatballs and it tastes like water. Lots of weird people in the restaurant (I guess lower class people in Ithaca tend to pick this place as their monthly treat). Anyway would not go back to this place again in any location....\n" u"Worst denny's ever.  The waitress never checked up in us and completely forgot to bring my soup.  When i asked about the soup she came back 20minutes later to say it was still frozen which is why she hadn't brought it. She's lucky she got a tip at all.  I hate this place and it made me want punch someone in the face.\n"]
86.Scale House Brew Pub,[u'It was the first place ever to fry their burgers to the request and not "well-done" no matter what you ask for. For such a small and "not fancy" pub/pizzeria I was genuinely surprised. The beers on tap are also pretty good. Overall they offer a great quality/price ratio.\n' u"Very lack luster food. I ordered a BLT it should be really hard to serve a bad BLT but there was just nothing good about it. I ordered medium wings but they have to be mild because they have no flavor at all. I'll eat just about anything but I won't get food here again.\n" u"Pizza here is usually pretty good but a recent take-out order experience was marred by the owner giving me a hard time about using a restaurant.com coupon. He needs to revise the fine print on his offer if he only wants to honor them for dine-in. I don't appreciate being treated like I'm trying to cheat them.\n" u"Scale House is amazing! So glad we found this gem- especially for laundry day. (Right next to laundry mat). Always great beer and if they didn't have anything on tap I was interested in great bottle beers and wine as well. Food is amazing! From great pizzas and calzones to deliciously greasy beer battered mushrooms and even their salads. Showed so many friends this spot since it was close to us in Cayuga not too many downtownians seemed to know about it- they always said great things about it. Service was always so friendly ended up in there on their open mic night and that was fun! Highly recommend\n" u"This is a great little pub. I love their pizza and the service has been good the 2 times I've been here. If you want a pizza while out this low-key pub is the place to go.\n" u'Nice service and quiet atmosphere.  Really great beer. Would go back again. Anxious to try the peanut butter stout.\n' u'I used to order the Chicken Philly sub all the time. I guess the cook changed since the last time I ordered. This one came with onions without asking. The sub roll was cut completely in half with VERY small diced chicken pieces. You can imagine the task it is to pick up such an assembled sub. No seasoning what-so-ever; unless you count the free and unwanted onions.\n\nThe only plus I can offer is the delivery driver was very nice.\n' u"What a hidden gem!!! Amazing pizza and delicious beer brewed onsite. Great small atmosphere. I'm so glad we found this place. I enjoyed the oatmeal stout and peanut butter stout. Also tried the IPA and red ale which also were good! Pizza handmade on premise and absolutely delicious!!\n" u'Great and I mean great pizza plus brews made on the premises add up to a terrific place to try.\n' u'This is a very friendly place. It\'s not immediately obvious but the "brew pub" is actually just a craft brewery/pub attached to a pizzeria. You can either sit on the bar side or sit on the pizzeria side.\n\nThe pizzeria makes the normal stuff including quite a few varieties of calzone. They are tasty and fresh and priced right. They deliver as well.\n\nThe beer is pretty good. They were out of the red ale when we stopped in (seems to be a theme looking at the other reviews) so I tried the bock and my wife tried the pilsner. There is some creativity evident and the brews are tasty enough. They don\'t hit a home run but I\'d rate the bock as a 3 on a 5-point scale.\n\nThe bar side is run by a great guy who we got to meet and chat with for a while. We came in at lunch time but he informed us of the various events and live music they have. We\'ll definitely return for jazz on Sundays or possibly open-mic night.\n' u"Stopped in on a Sunday Funday during football season. Great place to catch a game. Wonderful beer and the Speidie wings are THE BEST wings I've ever had and I eat a lot of wings. Definitely recommended.\n" u"Stars based largely on beer quality... Not good. Decent place nice people calzones were good but the beer was quite sub par. I had an IPA that tasted nothing like an IPA no hop flavor whatsoever. The lager tasted like a Rauchbier with no mention of smokey character. Pretty disappointing.\nIf this was just a pizza joint I'd give them four stars but as a brewery there's room for improvement.\n" u'Pizzas are great. The service was a bit slow and they ran out if dishes. Once we get service the waitress was great. Enjoying open mike was another plus to stopping in.\n' u'First the good. The spicy sausage and mushroom pizza was great!  The beer is horrible. Not brewed to style at all. Not even close with the hefeweizen and bock. Horrible ...horrible beers. Utterly nasty.  Worst than most first attempts at home brew.  The IPA was...drinkable barely. The staff could care less. A guy was asleep in the middle of the place. All the people at the bar were drinking Bud/miller/coors. Avoid unless you are already drunk and want some greasy pizza.\n' u"Best deal for cold beer and good food!  2 pints and a dozen wings or small pizza 10 bucks! And they have goldfish for snacks at the bar. You can't go wrong!\n" u'Stopped in when visiting the area for a wedding good was delicious! Service was great. Highly recommend the wings!\n' u"Wish I could give this brewery more than 2 stars because the owner/brewer was very nice. However the place was dirty (cleanliness is next to Godliness when brewing beer) and most of the beer very ordinary. The red ale was off with  a medicinal aftertaste. Double bock was good. Wouldn't use the restroom because of the overall air of uncleanliness.\n" u"A nice little micro brewery with good pizza and calzones. It's short staffed sometimes but people are really nice. Check out the live jazz and rock music evenings. They also have a karaoke night if you are into that kind of thing. Highly recommend the hot wings. Definitely the best calzones in town!\n" u'This review is less about the food than the tactics used by staff. First to be fair let me say the pizza was very good. The beer is made on premises but it is very mediocre. I had 2 different beers and I really can\'t highly recommend either of them. The stout was especially disappointing very watered down and not very complex in flavor.\n\nThe real problem started with the "Happy Hour". They have a board that says draft beer was $2.  I mentioned this to the waitress and the fact I wanted to order 3 beers up front to take advantage of this since the happy hour was due to end in 15 minutes she said this was no problem. Apparently it was as when I received the bill I was charged $3 apiece this was for 2 different types of their beer. When I brought this to her attention she stammered and then said these were "specialty" beers. When I asked which beers were $2 I was told that of the 4 draft beers they had on tap only one was $2. It said nothing on the board about this nor did the waitress mention this. This seems deceitful a bait and switch tactic. I know we\'re only talking about $3 total here but it\'s more about the principal.\n' u'Goldfish for a snack at the bar is a great start. Pizza and wing specials were great. Bartender could not have been nicer. Will go again soon.\n']
32.Gorgers Subs,[u"Such a great little place in Ithaca. The bread they use is super soft and perfect for their sandwiches. Along with the rest of my group I opted for their lunch special which is half a sub with choice of soup fries or salad and a beverage for $8. I had the Cuban with a cup of clam chowder while my sister had the Banh Mi with the clam chowder as well. All of the sandwiches we got were so flavorful and filling - and we only got half! The chowder was not great at all but this place isn't known for soups right?\n\nThis is definitely the spot whether you're starving sober not sober or just craving a good sandwich. With all of their options you will be tempted to come back and try them all! There are also vegan options as well!\n" u"Recommended by a friend. The subs are unique and really big. You may struggle to finish a while unless very hungry. Also make sure you have room for fries because those are massive too. \n\nThey use paper towels as plates instead of washing dishes which gives them a very casual environment (not to mention water conservation... although throwing out more paper so who knows if there's points for sustainability). \n\nHighly recommend the south of the border Cabernet steak and chupacabra!\n\nAlso very fast even when busy.\n" u"Stumbled across this place by accident while enjoying Wizarding Weekend in Ithaca!  Both make me want to come back and visit Ithaca again and again!  After walking around at the festival all day we were hungry and this place caught our eye so glad we came in!\n\nI love places where you order and then get to see your food made right in front of you.  Fast service there were plenty of people inside but we got our food in good time.  We just had a seat at the long bar along the kitchen and watched a variety of different foods being prepared.\n\nMy husband and I both had a hard time deciding what to order as there was a huge selection of sandwiches subs nachos and salads.  I ordered the buffalo chicken nachos and it was fantastic!  A huge container of nacho chips smothered in lots of toppings!  I loved that they didn't hold back on the toppings on anything they sold.  I can't say enough about how good they were and how much there was.  I had about half of mine left it made for good late night leftovers after our evening out!\n\nWould definitely recommend this to anyone going to Ithaca!  Oh and also stop at wizarding weekend!!\n" u'Delicious sub sandwiches served on homemade bread. A wide variety of options are available many of which can be made vegan or vegetarian. The lunch combo with a drink and fries/salad is a great deal. Fries could be better then cut them to order but only give them a single fry.\n' u"EXCELLENT!! Just south of Cayuga lake right in the center of town with ample street parking (meter) and lot right next door. We were driving 4 hours north and very hungry and were not disappointed.  My friend had pulled pork which was very flavorful spicy and moist. Huge homemade sub roll and fresh cilantro on top. I had Chipotle Bacon salad which was delicious. Inhaled it. Bacon tasted like it was grilled over open fire. Black beans did too and a touch of chipotle heat  fresh romaine and cheddar. Washed it down with Morrocan Mint ice tea. We're going back on our return home.  This is a grab and go place but there are a few tables and barstools.\n" u"These subs are huge! Just one of them could easily fees two people. \n\nI ordered the Cuban and Modena to go. They were both good. However I had asked to substitute the pickles in the Cuban for tomatoes and lettuce and the cashier had trouble understanding what I wanted. After a few minutes of back and forth he finally got it and entered it into the system. When I opened the sub it only had Canadian ham and pulled pork. No pickles but no tomatoes or lettuce either. Normally I wouldn't be so annoyed but it was such a meaty sandwich and the Canadian ham made it very salty. An addition of any vegetable would have given a refreshing element and it could have easily bumped this up to 4 stars. \n\nJust make sure the person taking your order understands any changes you would like for your sub. \n\nThe Modena is drenched in balsamic reduction which I love. But it was so messy to eat especially how they wrapped it to go. Whenever I get subs to go they are double wrapped which goes a long way especially when it's dripping with sauce! They also didn't distribute the reduction evenly which is a shame because it did add a nice tang to the chicken. \n\nI'd recommend having lots of napkins handy when you're eating from here!\n\nI can see how this place would be popular with students but it needs to fix some hiccups before it really deserves a near perfect rating.\n" u"A sandwich & sub lover's paradise.  Best cheesesteak I've ever had.  Fresh baked-from-scratch breads and real beef (not the shredded stuff).  This is a hidden gem and worth checking out if you're in the Ithaca area.  There is a small amount of indoor seating.\n" u'So my girlfriend and I wanted to try something new for lunch and we came across this place on yelp.  We ordered the Banh Mi and it was delicious.  We split it for 9 dollars and it was plenty of food for both of us.  Pulled pork was very good with pickled carrots fresh cilantro cucumbers onion and mayo.  Its a hidden gem in Ithaca on states street.  Everything was very fresh and you could taste every flavor individually.  The bread was thick and nothing was soggy or runny. For a cheap fresh option I would come here again.\n' u"Love me some CTB but Gorgers is the best sandwich place in Ithaca. Enormous portions. Fresh bread. Great vegetarian options (seitan or eggplant can be substituted on any sub). Cool vibe. May not win any health awards but you're sure to leave satisfied.\n" u"Okay so I was skeptical walking into this place...not because it's a bit divey and not because it's more of a quick stop type of place--I go to places like this all the time. The issue was my friends and I came here after hearing here was a 1.5 hour wait at Just a Taste a place I really wanted to go to. So when you go from Just a Taste to Gorgers Subs I could not help but feel like I was settling.\n\nI. Was. So. Wrong. When we walked in the first thing that really caught y eye was the beautiful blackboard artwork that displayed the menu. I am such a sucker for beautiful chalkboard art. The menu is simple and easy to read. It is also SO accommodating of dietary needs. I went with a vegetarian and a vegan and I am a carnivore. \n\nMy friends ended up getting the Bahn Mi with fried eggplant and I got the Bahn Mi with pork. We shared fries. It was delicious! Sandwiches come in a full and half sizes. A half size sandwich is more than enough for one person with an average appetite. My Bahn Mi was not exactly authentic but definitely flavorful and tastes very fresh. What I enjoyed was the Gorgers Sub bread was toasted but unlike a typical Bahn mi roll that is so toasted it will cut the inside of your mouth the toasted sub was perfect.\n\nWe got here around 7pm and it were eating within 10 minutes. They cook sandwiches to order and everything is fresh hot and just great. I've been meaning to come here for some and am glad I finally made it. Definitely will be back to try other things.\n\nAs a side note the place has longboards hanging as decor--uh awesome!\n" u'"In order to succeed we must first believe that we can" - Nikos Kazantzakis. This was the first quote that I thought of when I walked through the mouth of this beast of an establishment. Being the Gorgers rookie I was I found myself intimidated by the gorgeous Gorgers menu. A wide variety of different sandwiches stood before me as my mouth watered due to a strenuous drive through the Ithaca rain. I ordered a Modena sandwich a Mediterranean twist on a classic chicken sandwich. When my sandwich arrived it almost broke the table being the behemoth that it was. I tried to finish it but could not succeed. With a full belly and a satisfied tongue I was ready to explore the rest of Ithaca.\n' u'Man. Best kept secret in Ithaca! Had the steak sub and it was incredible! The bread is made fresh on the premises. Nice portion also.\n' u'Ordered the spicy vegetarian chili.  Wow! Loved it.  Not the best ambiance to sit but good for to go items.\n' u"When you travel you have to take good with the bad. And food choices for a vegetarian are not only limited they are a RISK! So image when a risk pays up big time!! And I mean big.\nWe stopped by Gorgers on way back home from finger lakes. When we pulled in front of the place I was pretty sure I had used up my good food luck (you see we are foodies and don't eat at chain restaurants. And did I say we are vegetarians). So imagine my utter and absolute joy when I found that the food was beyond delish.\nI am not a fan of tofu but the way they cook their tofu is far from anything I have tasted. Any place that sells veg food has me as a customer. Any place that sells delicious veg food has there on repeat.\n" u"gorgers is my favorite thing in ithaca. subs are huge and great. I usually only get a half because I'm not going to stop til all the food is gone. Super tasty and pretty inexpensive. Can make any sub veg by subbing Seiten or fried egg plant. fries on cut and fried in store too. the only business I'll miss when I move.\n" u"On a visit to Ithaca for a campus tour of Cornell our family was looking for a quick and casual lunch before driving off to visit a friend living in the Rochester area.  After some quick searching we saw some positive reviews for Gorgers and their subs so decided to give it a shot.\n\nIt was a pretty hot August day and the temperature inside was quite stifling even with a few fans propped through the narrow location.  Our order was taken quickly and we decided to eat there vs. our car.  There was a great aroma and particularly the fresh made bread it appears they make on site.  My only gripe about the location is that it was a bit on the dirty side inside --- the tables and floor weren't clean and garbage not cleared.\n\nOn to the subs.  I debated between the Banh Mi and the Sweet Chili Chicken and opted for the latter.  While I really liked my sub I watched them make several of the former and they looked out of this world (and I had a hankering once I started on my sub for something with a bit more bite).  The bread was so fresh and soft perfect for a sub.  I liked that the chicken (and pork as my youngest son had a pulled pork sub) was not chunks but shredded.  The meat was fresh white meat and very soft and moist and the sweet chili sauce added a nice flavor.  My oldest had a cheese steak with onions and by the time I looked over to try a bit I got the last remaining bite.  It too was delicious.  My wife had a half salad/half sub sandwich while my daughter had a BBQ chicken sub.  The subs were all quite large and well stuffed with meat and fixings and very reasonably priced.  I can only imagine the parade of students from around that frequent this place for the large variety of subs at great prices.\n" u"We stopped in here for lunch while attending wizarding weekend. My husband got the banh mi. I got the Cuban. We shared fried pickles and French onion soup. So much food we had to bring half our subs home. They give you a lot and for a great price. The Cuban was the best I have ever had. Thick slices of Canadian bacon instead of the usual sliced ham. And delicious pulled pork. The fried pickles were homemade as were the pickles themselves and the bread. My husband loved the banh mi. If it wasn't a 2 hour commute we would eat there every week! Please come to Rochester!\n" u'sort of let down  everyone said how great this place is.  I did not like sweaty hairy guys making my sandwich.  how about an air conditioner and some hair nets?   I order the Philly cheese steak  the onions tasted like burnt oil  the meat was not very good and there was not enough to for the large amount of bread..  also order the home made chips  came out greasy and under cooked.  too bad.\n' u"Maybe the best Sub I've had. Being vegetarian I assumed my choices were limited but not here. Had a sub called Blue fire - with lettuce tomatoes onions and fried breaded eggplant with blue cheese sauce and a spicy Caribbean dressing. The subs are around 8-9 dollars but they're huge. They also appeared to have some very nice looking soup and starters. Loved the place / will go here again next time in Ithaca\n" u'Gorgers is an awesome place to go to when you\'re ridiculously hungry and want a quick fulling meal that isn\'t dirt cheap but manageable. Average cost of a visit here is about 12-14 bucks. As people have mentioned it isn\'t the cleanest of places total "bros" run this place but it\'s not to a point where I\'m afraid to eat there. The sandwich ideas are amazing all the sandwiches sound great and nearly all of them can be offered vegetarian fried eggplant and seitan are alternatives to meat. \n\n     Again as people have mentioned before me but I think bares repeating the bread is made on location and it\'s pretty good bread. They also offer flatbreads if that\'s your thing.  My issue with Gorgers is although the sandwiches\' components all are great they aren\'t balanced. I keep giving these guys the benefit of the doubt because they are talented cooks it\'s just they out WAAAAAAY too much sauce on the sandwiches. Every time I\'ve gone whether alone or with my boyfriend or friends in general we have the same complaint. Maybe next time I\'ll ask for them to go light on the sauce and that\'ll fix my problem? I don\'t know. \n\n      Portions are really what bring me back when I need something super hearty I head over to Gorgers. They offer 1/2 sandwiches too along with salads and soups so you can have a well rounded meal whether it be huge or not. I usually do a whole sandwich and get two meals.  My issue is the fry size you either get small fries which are an okay size a little small for me personally or large fries which are a huge huge huge portion. I really wish they\'d get an in between size. \n    \n     Today however something happened outside of the food that didn\'t sit well with me. When I entered Gorgers two women had already ordered and we\'re getting their food to go. They got their sandwiches but the guys forgot to get them their fries they were in a rush so they decided not to wait for them to prepare them. To be fair fries are cut and made to order here so they do take a while(worth it in my opinion). Upon exiting Gorgers with their food the cashier decided to talk about these ladies at least one of them in particular. He mentioned how he "hooked up" with this woman and other things you should generally keep to yourself. Had he whispered this to his coworker I wouldn\'t have cared because I wouldn\'t have heard it. He said it loud enough for everyone there to hear it and even said where she worked at some point. \n\n     To many people this may not matter and they\'ll still eat there. I probably won\'t. I\'ve given these guys the benefit of the doubt plenty of times and the food is always okay. If I\'m paying for something I really want it to be worth it I\'m a broke college student. I don\'t want to eat food made by jerks. \n\n     BUT if you don\'t care about who makes your food and your hungry AF and on a budget and on a tight schedule then go to Gorgers!!!\n']
114.Apollo Restaurant,[u"I ordered delivery and the warm food arrived in the time frame given.\n\nThe food was excellent. I had won ton soup which wasn't overly salty as it often is. The dumplings were very good. \n\nThe shrimp egg roll was good full of shrimp and nicely spiced.\n\nThe beef with scallions was delicious  and the beef was plentiful.\n\nGood choice.\n" u"I just ordered a some food witch is gross but there was a bug inside a piece of shrimp I'm sick I'm only giving one star because I can't give 0\n" u"It satisfies for what it is: a casual convenient Chinese take-out joint. Super convenient and relatively clean great central location in Collegetown. The food quality is consistent and I don't think it's too greasy or sickeningly flavored. The people there are really nice and I never had problems.\n" u"Ordered my food at 10:30pm and now it's pass 12am but still hasn't been delivered. The driver is not answering the phone and the restaurant didn't give me refund for that. Terrible service.\n" u'Top 5 places I miss at Cornell: Duffield Hall the fields on North Campus RPCC the Arts Quad and Apollo\'s (obviously in ascending order). P.S. I don\'t care that Apollo\'s isn\'t owned by Cornell.\n\nThis place really caters to all. It has a buffet with Panda Express-like Chinese food that white people enjoy and a separate made-to-order menu of about 300 random dishes (although I\'m pretty sure they\'ll make you anything if you ask..  my friend told me he ordered a cheesecake and they just appeared with one. they might have run over to CTB and bought a slice).\n\nDo not be fooled by all the people ordering from the buffet. ORDER FROM THE MENU. The food is fresher and 10x better. Two dishes I highly recommend are San Bao rice and Salt and Pepper Pork. And if you insist on getting the Panda Express food at least order a fresh batch of General Tso\'s (no disrespect to the general). They are a bit more expensive than the buffet items but well worth the extra few dollars. \n\nBefore I start drooling on my keyboard I\'d like to end with a quote from the late Apollo himself: "I would found an institution where any person can find heartburn in any dish." Go get it while you can.\n' u'Surprising authentic chinese food for a really good price (for collegetown) -- I eat here almost daily.\n' u"I only go here because it's very close to where I live. I get the chicken dishes which are honestly really good but very overpriced. There's a $10 credit card minimum which is extremely annoying so I second think most of my chances to eat here. But no worries you won't have any trouble hitting the $10 threshold because of the exorbitant prices. Asking for brown rice instead of white also costs extra which I don't understand.\n\nThere's a worker here who started recently this short guy who sometimes wears a fitted cap that always has a sneer on his face and looks and acts like he wants to choke you out if you make the mistake of approaching the counter when he's on duty. Probably a relative of the owner.\n\nALWAYS order from the back never from the buffet. It's not worth the food poisoning. The owners are pretty cheap people as is the case with most Chinese places. But overall a surprisingly authentic Chinese restaurant (at least from what I gathered seeing the clientele). The secret seems to be in their sauce.\n" u"Definitely one of the better Chinese takeout places in Ithaca. Having lived in Asia I can tell you this is heavily Americanized Chinese food. It is nothing special but in comparison to some of the really horrible Chinese takeout Ithaca is home to this is our new go-to takeout joint. The flavors were fine if a little bland but didn't taste like week old fryer grease (I'm looking at you Ling Ling Garden). \n\nI live downtown and delivery took a solid hour which was OK because the Apollo was upfront with the wait time. The delivery guy was very nice and the food arrived hot. Some takeout places around here has taken up to three hours (I might be referring to Capital Corners) and then treated me like crap when I wanted a refund. Not so here very satisfied with the delivery experience.\n\nOverall in any normal city this would have gotten a three-star rating from me. However here in Ithaca with our plethora of truly horrible Asian takeout this place is pretty good. We will be returning customers. \n\nPS- My kids really really liked the food.\n" u'This was my go to restaurant while studying in college. I came here 4 to 5 times a week. And I always ordered the same thing. My favorite combo was egg and tomato with general tsaos chicken. If possible I\'d do the egg and tomato with sesame chicken instead. Together with white rice it was a combustion of flavors. \n\nThe staff was always friendly to me since I came in here so often. I believe that the curry chicken was also pretty good. \n\nOverall the location would be considered "a hole in the wall." But I take this as a given. If you\'re in college hungry sleepy and don\'t have too many options this is going to be gold. \n\nOne last thing go in for the lunch specials! Super cheap and there are six or seven options that you can combine! College days...\n' u"They've improved quite substantially over the last couple of years. Their pork fried rice and lo mein used to be very bland but now it's very flavorful. Always super quick and has a very good combination special deal that includes an entree fried rice or lo mein and an eggroll or soup for like $8.\n\nOnly downsides are a $10 minimum on credit cards and they have plastic Snapples instead of glass Snapples.\n" u'Good food for late at night. Always came here after my night class. They have great congee I love the ginger scallion. Stay away from the noodle dishes. Service is okay they give what you want as quickly as possible but service ends there.\n' u"This place is a typical Chinese restaurant/take-out place that is open late so that's a plus. I haven't tried most of the items on the menu but have gotten their boxes-to-go a couple times. These boxes cost $7 and you get rice two selections of the many entrees they have up front and soup which is a pretty good deal. Food is okay and pretty Americanized. Be warned: they do use quite a bit of MSG and the food can be pretty greasy as well. \n\nIn summary: Okay place for a quick meal and good if you're in a rush\n" u"With how much I've eaten here I've given up at least a few good years of my life.\n\nNo problem A+\n\nsanbao rice salt and pepper pork are the way to go.\n" u"The only reason that might make me come back is the price. This is probably a cheaper if not cheapest option of chinese food around my apartment. Personally don't think it's authentic. If I were to just rate the food it would be two stars.\n" u'Best place to eat in Cornell not even close.  Paul the owner is a great guy and always takes care of his customers.  Great good Great prices.  Sweet and sour chicken? yes please!!\n' u"Mediocre Chinese food. Can't speak about the location only ever ordered late night delivery from here. The plus is that they're open real late and delivery is generally pretty speedy. Also they're decently priced and they have lots of combo options which are a great way to order. The food isn't great but it isn't bad either. It's pretty average but Ithaca doesn't have many Chinese options.\n" u'There are some good foods here and I have a bonus star for having BROWN RICE. This is one of the very few sensible places that offer people brown rice in this area despite many of my friends requesting it.\nWhenever I order always vegetarian foods they are always really greasy---even last time when I asked for very little oil with the Chinese eggplant.  If they can make things without drowning them in OIL I would go there more often.\n' u'Food here is definitely mediocre at best. You\'ll see a lot of the items which Chinese people would never order in a restaurant (think Panda Express types of food). Since this is the case it\'s far from authentic Chinese food. But it\'s cheap and that\'s why it gets so much business. You can get a two-item combo with rice for $6.75 which is appropriately priced for the quantity you get unlike the more authentic places in Ithaca which tend to have ripoff prices for their "higher quality" food.\n\nThey don\'t take card for under $10 and since food is so cheap don\'t come here without cash in hand. It\'s kinda annoying since it\'s one of the few places in Collegetown where this is the case and you\'ll be forced to pay with cash.\n' u"Great late night take out Chinese food. Their Red Cooked pork over rice is solid as well as the homemade dumplings and congee. Did I mention they're open til 2AM? This place is a great place for satisfying late night Chinese food cravings and I highly recommend it.\n" u'Good food. Have been here for many times. \n\nThe first time I came to Ithaca I came here. At first I felt it was not so good. But now I gradually like It more. Now have to have it.\n']
61.Texas Roadhouse - Ithaca,[u"Texas Roadhouse and other chain steakhouses are unfairly discriminated against. Quite honestly the value is much better than many restaurants in Ithaca. For $50 two people can have a very nice steak dinner and take home extra rolls with cinnamon butter. Sure it's not as sexy as Mahogany Grill or Just a Taste but for the quality of the food and service as long as you're not looking for a unique culinary experience Texas Roadhouse is a great way to have a solid dinner.\n\nFirst off this isn't my first rodeo at Texas Roadhouse but this is the best one I've been to. The place was packed on a Tuesday and that's a good sign. Furthermore the service was solid and timely. Best of all they brought us fresh hot rolls without us asking after we finished the first basket AND they offered us more rolls to take home at the end of our meal. Y'all know how incredible those rolls are.\n\nOnion Cactus Blossom - a classic at Texas Roadhouse Bugaboo and the like. Well-fried with tender sweet onion and the cajun horseradish sauce actually keeps things from getting too greasy. Really tasty but definitely not good for you and will fill you up.\n\nRibs - a full rack for $20. The sauce is not too sweet and has a decent char grilled flavor from being finished on the grill. The ribs aren't the moistest or meatiest I've ever had but is still a solid value.\n\nSirloin - 11oz sirloin for $15. Very juicy meaty and perfectly grilled to my requested doneness of medium-rare. I think they might Jaccard their steaks but either way it was delicious. While sirloin is a relatively lean cut this steak was juicy and tender.\n\nSides - salads are overdressed as they are at 90% of American chain restaurants. The fries here are really bad stay far far away from their dry oversalted spuds.\n" u'Always like the atmosphere here comparably normal crowd friendly staff and early evening dinner option (!) is reasonably priced at 10 bucks however:\n\nthe pulled pork was cold inside and the steak cooled off real quick the side portions were rather small chilli was good the bread with butter was bad...\n\n..no need to come again...\n' u"I've been twice and both times I had a good steak as far as chains are concerned. The sides are ok. The rolls come with this cinnamon butter that is very tasty! The last visit our server was very attentive and checked in on us probably every 5 minutes or so. She was great! \n\nBoth visits we had to wait for a table. 1st visit it was probably 30 minutes of waiting. 2nd time maybe 5 minutes of waiting.\n\nA little noisy but that is pretty much expected at these kind of places. I will be going again.\n" u"Pleasantly surprised with Texas Roadhouse!\n\nI don't usually visit chains but we went in on a lark and the wait wasn't too bad for a party of four. The staff at the host stand was friendly and directed us to the bar while we waited for 10-15 minutes. The bartender was also quite personable and offered quick service.\n\nAfter being seated we were approached promptly by a server who offered water and asked if we wanted anything else from the bar at that moment. I really appreciate this sort of quick attention when I'm seated at a restaurant. The entire ordering process was efficient and we had our food in no time. Even while we waited we got warm rolls peanuts and more drinks.\n\nThe food itself is pretty good just standard mid-grade steak restaurant food. Steak is their mainstay but there are plenty of other things on the menu. Almost everything can be covered in mushrooms onions gravy or jack cheese. The steaks came out slightly overcooked (medium-rare was actually medium medium-well was actually well) but that's to be expected at this kind of place and I'd recommend ordering one notch rarer than you normally like.\n\nI'll be back!\n" u'If I could do a 4.5 I would. It was very busy when I went but we were seated and served quickly. The food was delicious. My hubby and I both got steak and while both were closer to well than the ordered medium rare the flavor and juciness was there. All sides and drinks were good and the wait staff seemed to really care.\n' u'This location is brand new and is still trying to figure itself out. I am sorry Alyssa B had such a negative experience but I have been there twice and both times were good but not great. There is still quite a bit of training and learning going on but I think the food is solid and the prices are affordable. Every TR is the same but what makes this location kind of cool is that you see a side of Ithaca that is missing from other places usually dominated by the Cornell/IC crowd. So if you feel like eating some solid proteins; listening to country music; watching sports; and watching the humiliating birthday celebrations for unlucky customers this is the place for you.\n' u'This place is a sensory overload. I walk past this place almost every day and I can hear country music blaring from across the street. You don\'t need music playing OUTSIDE your restaurant. The music inside is a bit loud but they seem to adjust it according to the size of the crowd inside? It died down significantly when we were there and when it did the volume was turned down a lot. But I think the most cringe-worthy part of the experience was how every 10 minutes someone had a birthday and they encouraged the whole place to shout "YEE HAW!" The food wasn\'t bad for a chain restaurant. If you want a mind blowing steak go elsewhere... obviously. I just wanted the ambience of a Texas themed restaurant since I do miss the obnoxious pride that state has for itself. And let me tell you I was raised in Texas and never did I hear anyone shout yee haw much less at a restaurant.\n' u'Not bad. Loud family friendly. (As to whether these are plusses or minuses can depend on your worldview.) Good place to get an OK piece of meat relatively inexpensively. Be prepared for a wait on a Saturday night.\n' u"We have always enjoyed the food at the Elmira restaurant but tonight we tried the Ithaca restaurant.  The food was delicious as expected but we ended up packing our meal to go and leaving because our table was beset with an excessive number of flies.  It was like eating outside near garbage cans.  The staff were well aware of the problem I'm sure management was working on the situation but they should have closed the restaurant until they could fix this issue.  I don't expect to eat a $40 meal surrounded by flies.  I will give them another chance after they have been open a little longer but first impressions stick and tonight was an unpleasant dining experience.\n" u'Took my family to the Ithaca location on Sunday September 11th for dinner.  As always we had a great time.  The food came out fast and perfect  the staff was very attentive  and took special interest on making sure my 1 and 2 year old son had a great time\n' u'I went for a meal at Texas Roadhouse for the first time  never being to Texas Roadhouse I didn\'t know what they had to offer but assumed it was similar to a outback or other chain steakhouses. I was very impressed upon entering to see the "Butchers" behind the case cutting steaks fresh and displaying their product in the front refrigerated case to allow customers to choose there own steak. Along with buckets of shelled salted peanuts like you get at the baseball games everywhere I don\'t know what else you could ask for. I went in a small party just with two other people and the service was very fast getting are orders taken in food out in around 15-20 minutes or so They also checked in relatively often in between square dancing to the  jukebox and birthday yee hawing. I Would definitely go back  and have no complaints worth mentioning thanks Texas Roadhouse for a great night and not just another night out for dinner.\n' u"I ate at this Texas Roadhouse in Ithaca n it was not very good servicebrought us our drinks n left n took some time to take our orderthen our salads took forever to getthen when they arrived so did our steaks n on top of that they wasnt cooked as ordered !! They did bring me another steak n potato but then it wasnt right either !! I enjoy most all Texas Roadhouses meals but this one just didnt do it for my cousin n her friend n i !!! They're local n im from Indiana but very pour service in and out of the kitchen !!\n" u"Go to the roadhouse in Elmira. This one is garbage- the staff doesn't know what they are doing. I got a foot long hair cooked into my fried chicken. When my server put the plate in front of me I pulled it out immediately and showed him. I did not want to cause a scene so I told him not to worry about it. I am a server too. When someone tells me not to worry about it I worry more. Because that is the kind of person that will leave unsatisfied unless you take the initiative to fix whatever mistake was made right? So if they don't want it replaced and they seem okay to eat their meal  give a discounted bill.. Or offer a dessert.. Don't awkwardly avoid the subject when you come back to the table.  call the manager over to ENSURE GUEST SATISFACTION. the hosts that sat us gave us a 10-15 minute wait time and then our pager went off 1 minute later. Obviously they didn't know what they were doing. Although there were 5 of them?? Okay... They seated us at a god awful seat I should have refused... Right next to the kitchen the entrance and the bar. when the servers came through with their heavy serving trays to pick up a tray stand they would rest their full trays on the half wall to my left. So if anything slid off their tray which was bound to happen as I saw at least 3 servers do this!!!! If anything fell it would land on my lap!!!! I expected so much more from a Texas Roadhouse. What is wrong with the management that this happens? Not to mention that there must have been a server on for every 2 tables at least 5 hostesses & 2 bartenders? Looked like more than one manager too... I don't think anyone should go here for dinner. Drive to Elmira. You will get better food and better service. Worth the trip. This place is a joke of a Texas Roadhouse. Must be since the upper management doesn't know their job... I heard that the hiring process was a little more thorough and selective. Guess not. The steak as always was good. They would be smart to take everything else off the menu and make it self service. waited on my drink for 10 minutes after I got my meal. What an awful experience.. Really? Really?? Like shouldn't there be a procedure to ensure guest satisfaction? It's a chain. I've heard how the owner is and he would never allow it. It must be a problem with management.\n" u"I'm a big fan of the Elmira roadhouse and was so exited to find out they finally opened one here at Ithaca. We went there right after they opened but their food was disappointing. All the steaks we ordered were overcooked and everything else was very very salty. Even the breads didn't live up to the roadhouse standards. I guess the chef here have a very steep learning curve. We'll still give it a try in the future and hopefully we won't get disappointed again.\n" u'We have been there twice now and they have the best ribs i have ever had. I had the sweet potato and the ceaser salad along with the 1/2 rack and I was full. Dan is the best waiter/server i have ever had in all my years of eating out and I am 66.\n']
60.Ithaca Sumo Japanese Hibachi and Sushi,[u"not sure where the two dollar signs are coming from...dinner is expensive lunch is a good value though\n\nfood is good bento boxes sushi and hibashi. the sushi is not super inventive but nicely done fairly quite atmosphere service is a bit harsh it's Chinese not Japanese just FYI\n" u"Had hibachi at Sumo. It was very entertaining and fun. Not the best hibachi I've had but it was delicious and very filling. \n\nI went with the steak and lobster option. It was very good. One thing was that the chef forgot to ask preferences for how the steak should be cooked until the meat was already on the grill. I asked for steak to be medium rare but ended up with medium. \n\nThe lobster was good. Definitely will be back to try the sushi!\n" u"Actually pretty good! I was surprised considering it's location (between a Party City and a Big Lot) but the sushi was good and the appetisers were too. Me and my girlfriend went for dinner had a couple of appetisers and about 5 plates of sushi to share and it was a great amount and came in at about $40.\n\nWord of warning: the wasabi siu mai (spelled 'shumai' on the menu) is VERY strong to the point where it was somewhat difficult to eat. M\n" u"It was real busy on Friday night. We waited 15 min for a table and our entrees didn't get served until another 20min(?) in. The chicken katsu donburi is kinda tasteless even though the veggies were ok. Tonkatsu is a little dry too but with the sauce it's ok.\n" u"It's one of the best place in Ithaca to get sushi. Do not expect a quick lunch but the sushi and lunch box all taste pretty good and worth the price. The place is Japanese style decorated which is nice. I strongly recommend the rice green tea if you are a tea lover.\n" u"I've been here 3 times and it's probably the best sushi place in Ithaca. \nHowever the second time I went we waited over an hour for our food. We were a decent sized group (7 people) but it took us an hour to get an appetizer... I think it was the waiter though because we watched the other waitress serve her tables really well.\nI got her as our server the next time and food came out pretty promptly. She checked up on us once in a while and she was always keeping an eye on us to refill water or ask if we needed anything. \nAlso the hostess was extremely nice and somehow fit us in at graduation dinner time without reservations!  \n\nI really would recommend the soft shell crab and duck roll for appetizers. I got the love boat all times we were there and the raw fish tastes far better than the stuff you find in collegetown or the commons. As for their special rolls I've tried the fantastic roll crazy dragon roll and a few more but they were all good - nothing to especially rave about. \n\nLong story short if you're in Ithaca and you want sushi go to Sumo.\n" u'The best quality sushi in the thaca area.  It is a little pricy but worth it. Sushi is fresh and hibachi is tasty. Service has always been fast and friendly.\n' u"Do not be put off by the outside appearance. Sumo is awesome! The staff are so fast and attentive the sushi is huge and the food is wuite good. I've been here two or three times now and have not been disappointed yet. The miso soup is always perfect not too salty and just enough tofu. Duck japanease steam rolls oysters etc. are aways fresh. One sushi roll will fill you up. The habachi meal will leave you overstuffed. The cocktails are pretty awesome too! I honestly believe this is the very best sushi in all of Ithaca!!!\n" u"We dined as a family of 9 at the hibachi tables and had a fabulous time. The chef was very entertaining and had special skills to be able to toss food into your mouth from a distance. He entertained the smaller children with smoke and fire and kept them smiling. \n\nWe ordered some sushi at the table and although I didn't taste it my daughter who frequents the place loves it. The server was not exceptional as was the chef but she was courteous just not as attentive. The food is good overall like most Japanese steak houses you can't go wrong with good cuts of meat shrimp and chicken with a little teriyaki sauce right?\n" u"I've been to the one in New Hartford/Utica so this place was on the radar when I was riding into Ithaca this weekend. My food intake for the day up until that point was a large 24 oz Green Mountain so I was essentially dealing with a growling gut. Ithaca has a swath of sushi joints (sometimes Ithaca feels like Flushing for those who get this) so this one on the outskirts was a decent choice. Very fresh sashimi and the sushi chef offered a comp sample of his newest creation. While it was a panko crabstick cucumber hoisin mashup (Japanese poutine maybe) it was a nice gesture. Fair prices and very good quality. The locale is a pretty dismal strip mall (Triphammer suburban meh) next to a Big Lots but the food is the main point here.\n" u"pros: parking lot; clean environment; nice air conditioning ( that's it)\n\nCons: food is HORRIBLE! We ordered one Hibachi combo and one tonkatsu ramen. I am a ramen lover. Have been to Japan several times. Lived in Chicago and Atlanta for many years. I have tasted almost every ramen restaurant in ATL and Chicago. Let's be fair. I will give ATL's and Chicago's ramen an overall score of four star and give this Ithaca sumo japanese restaurant a ZERO. The soup of this so-called tonkatsu ramen tasted like water. And I want to ask the cook whether they understand what tonkatsu means in Japanese? It means PORK! Unfortunately this so-called Japanese restaurant does not have any pork so this tonkatsu ramen has no pork toppings!! I substituted pork with beef topping and trust me it's horrible. :(\n\nService is slow. I waited forty minutes for my ramen. It turned me down so bad. I'm really pissed because I felt I should have used my one hour precious time to do something more meaningful like sleeping in hunger. \n\nI don't know how they got their five stars. Maybe their sushi is good. :(\n" u"While the food is perfectly good the service and atmosphere have become worse and worse. I think the problem is that it is now the favorite place for Cornell sorority birthday parties and for people who have awful children; at times the waiting area is a sea of black puffy coats  punctuated by the seagull-like cries of ill-behaved toddlers. Our orders have been wrong the last three times we've been there (a problem of acoustics and language) and the main dishes arrive at random times often before the appetizers and sometimes when everyone else at the table wants dessert (a problem of not hiring enough servers). It was so crowded today we were shunted into an extra room probably one usually reserved for birthday parties which smelled faintly of breathe and diapers and was lit up like a subway car. No windows. Ninety percent preschoolers and Cornell sweatshirts. This is not the kind of experience a person would pay for. It felt like a museum snack bar. For the second time in recent months my main dish hadn't arrived by the time my fellow diners had finished so I told them not to bring it at all.\n\nThe reason I've given Sumo so many chances is because it's one of the few places with decent food that is not downtown where it is impossible to park on a weekend evening and where you have to wait a minimum of 45 minutes for a table anyway. The misery of stumbling several blocks through an Ithaca blizzard in your nice clothes only to stand forever in an entryway before finally getting seated at a tiny table your thigh practically touching some stranger's is not worth the food. Even though the restaurant food in Ithaca is really good esp compared to the rest of Upstate! It's getting so that a couple of slices of toast on the couch feels luxurious compared to eating out in this town.\n" u'Recently moved to the area from a more metropolitan area this is the first sushi place we tried in Ithaca. The sushi here is middle of the road acceptable not bad.. not good.  Teriyaki chicken was also acceptable. From what I read from other Yelpers I guess this is one of the best in the area? Guess amazing sushi place is off the plate for us! \n\nThis place is clean and has nice decor also open later than other places. So if you are starving and have to have sushi I guess this is an acceptable option.\n' u'Great! A nice surprise wrapped in a strip mall wrapper. Good food and service. Nice decor and most of all great fresh well crafted sushi and rolls.\n' u'Sumo is the best quality sushi around and the price reflects that. Huge hibachi room** however the chefs are hit-or-miss: some are entertainers some are clearly just going through the motions. The staff is generally friendly though not overly helpful. No chopsticks unless you ask; which I think is odd. But the food is delicious and the portions are large. \n\n**Because of the size & shape of the room it can get really crowded and LOUD. If you have sensitive children you might do better sitting in the dining room.\n' u"Very pleasantly surprised especially since Ithaca so far hasn't offered as many good East Asian restaurants as I would have thought. Great taste lovely presentation of the food and wonderful atmosphere. (Bonus: A/C! Thank goodness. What a rarity.) I ordered a vegetable tempura dish and my companions ordered udon. We all loved our food! Topped with plum wine. They don't tell you this on the menu but their green tea is actually genmai--extra delightful!\n\nBefore coming I read that a few people thought the service was bad here however my experience has been the opposite; Our waitress was very patient in helping us.\n" u"I've been here a few times I am never disappointment. The food is delicious and the service is great too. I love their muchi ice cream!\n" u'Decent service and decent hibachi but not above average for variety of sushi I particularly like sushi with salmon I mean the specialty rolls with salmon.\n' u"Have always had a great experience for the hibachi. I've been here a few times and sometimes the service has been slow but the hibachi chefs have always been super funny and fun to watch. I went with my family after I graduated from college and they were very careful not to mix my mother's food with ours because she's highly allergic to gluten. They also have pretty good lunch specials!\n" u"To be honest almost all the sushi options in Ithaca are terrible. Sumo competes with Plum Tree for being the best of all the mediocre sushi restaurants in Ithaca - as a student I favor eating out at Sumo because it takes CityBucks. The salmon don is certainly cheaper than other restaurant's options (~14$) which is nice but they don't give much fish and it is sliced thin compared to Plum Tree. Their Spider Roll is quite good for the price and while their Lobster Tempura roll is expensive it is quite delicious. \n\nThe biggest issue with this place is wait time. If you do not come between the hours of 5:00-5:30 be prepared to wait an hour for either your food or to just sit down at a table. I came here for Valentine's day about a year ago -with reservations- and the waitress kept telling us to stay seated making us wait an hour before we could get a table despite the fact we had reservations. I avoided the place for a while then tried it again this time eating at 5 pm. The service was fine so I tried eating there with a group of friends around 6 pm....waited an hour for food and waiters were rude to us when we asked multiple times where our order was. \n\nIn other words the Japanese food at Sumo is one of the best you'll get for Ithaca but if you go there any later than 5:45 you are taking a gamble that may end in a less than pleasant dining experience.\n"]
153.Fiji Luigi,[u'Fiji luigi has a nice atmosphere and decent location. Also all proceeds go to charity! Great food for a great cause. Service left something to be desired however. Watch out for Dan Weinreb inexperienced and unprofessional. Be sure to get the fettuccini easily their best dish.\n']

44.The Establishment,[u"Establishment is completely run by the Hotel students who are taking an restaurant operation class. I have been pulled multiple times by friends that were the managers of the night but only this semester I finally had a chance to go. \n\nAlthough I agree that random unpredictable accident can happen. For example last time I ordered a special entree but were told that they ran out 20 minutes after ordering... when all my friends' entrees were served. Haha but the food was really good after all. I hope things like this don't happen that often. \n\nBesides some small accident the food and service is comparable to a decent restaurant level if not better. It's very easy to run into friends since most of the customers are Cornell students. For some reason I found it fun randomly running into so many friends at a restaurant. Moreover you don't pay tips which really saves a lot for such a nice dinner! =D\n" u"The establishment is entirely student run and every night a new group of students takes over the restaurant to run their own dinner service. So each night there is a special appetizer and entree that the student group came up with along with the regular menu. The regular menu features items like truffle fries pizzas a burger pasta duck and salmon. They also recently built a mini restaurant on the 3rd floor of Statler hall for the establishment so it is no longer located where terrace is during the day. It is actually a really nice place with a beautiful view of campus. \n\nNow to the food - we shared the special appetizer and the truffle fries and then got the burger and the duck. The truffle fries and the burger were so darn good. The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare (which is actually very impressive here in Ithaca because the only other place I have ever had my burger a perfect medium rare was at Ithaca ale house) and is topped with lettuce tomato onion BACON cheddar cheese (or whipped blue if that's your thing) and this fantastic aioli. It is also served with fries so like go ahead and double up on those because they are perfectly fried. I didn't try the duck because it's still a food that kind of skeeves me out but my friend said it was delicious. I trust her duck loving opinion. \n\nFor my burger and a portion of the appetizers it only cost me $19. So cheap! You also don't tip because it's a class (you literally are not allowed to tip) so you save a lot of money there too. I can't speak to the consistency of the place because I've only been there once (and i would imagine that it changes based on who is running the show that night) but I have 0 complaints from my experience last night.\n" u'Monday night team went all out. Best Brussel sprout dish ever caramelized with jaw-droppingly creative topping. Perfect duck over farro nice veg spaghetti re-created Napoleon pastry even bombolino!Wonderful conceptions excellent execution great service.\n' u"The Establishment is a restaurant in Statler Hotel on Cornell's campus run entirely by hotel school students. This includes the food which is also prepared by the same students.\n\nFood quality: decent definitely better than the average cook on campus but some novice mistakes were made in the cooking of our dishes. Bland pork chop steaks not fully marinated or if they were they needed more seasoning. And portions could be a lot better.\n\nPrice: Food is too expensive for what you get (taste and portionwise) expect to spend around 15 for entree pre-tax/tip appetizer is around 6 and dessert around 5. \n\nBut hey if you are going here you are here to support the students in their experiments.\n"]
50.Hot Truck,[u"Haven't been since 1999 and I still give it 5 stars. It was worth standing in the cold to get one of those amazing sandwiches before driving back to Binghamton.\n" u'She was Hot like a truck truck truck\nSandwich like what what what\nIfs ands or buts buts buts\nI think I\'ll order again\n\nThat was from "Truck Song" by "Shish-qo" a Kebab singer.\n\nI had quite a few run-ins with this truck. I must have visited it on 3 or 4 different occasions before I ever got to eat there and when I finally did it was a little underwhelming. I honestly think all they were doing was heating up frozen foods and microwaving stuff and selling it to the college kids at prices that weren\'t exactly bargain basement.\n\nIt was parked way up near some of the Ithaca Residence Halls. I waited long and hard (very hard ahem) for them to open n many occasions but they always let me down hard. Very hard. Ahem. I slept behind the truck one time in my car after a show covered in sweat (from the show you dirty wotsit) and they never opened up for me (much like the Ithaca girls) (and boys).\n\nHaving said that everything tasted greasy and good exactly the way college food always does and I appreciated its existence in the bleak wilderness of Ithaca. One of the most beautiful places on earth by the way. This food is not beautiful nor nutritious but it was tasty.\n\nI\'ve heard the truck is now long gone I haven\'t been back to Ithaca in awhile I\'m hoping to find out it\'s not true. I\'ve also heard they\'re serving hot truck food at the Shortstop Deli. I never liked that place... maybe I\'ll like it more now.\n' u"Very good food and service was speedy! Can't beat it for a late night snack! (Although the fries needed a little more salt)\n" u"My husband LOVED this place! He said the truck never moved and was always open after a night of excessive drinking. So it was reliable! I had one of their sandwiches the first night we were on campus . It was good but I think it would have tasted better had I been pissed drunk. Lol \n\nTheir pepperoni is better than their plain cheese. And I prefer eating the middle part of the sandwich as oppose to the tip/ends because there's a lot of bread on the ends and not enough stuffing.\n" u"I came here on a rainy friday night at midnight with a few friends. There was a handful of people ahead of us in line. The 6 of us ordered 2 grand slam sized sandwiches and it took about 12 minutes to come out.\n\nI had the Moby Delight. All the sandwiches are based on french bread pizza with various meats. The french bread is really light and gets kinda soaked by sauce. The meat and cheese form a nice cohesive filling. \n\nThe food is good but it's not particularly special. I think Louie's is a better deal; the Mobey delight with additional sausage was over $15. \n\nTl;dr: The food is decent but there's not really much of a selection and it's a bit over-priced.\n" u'Insane that this isn\'t a unanimous five stars. By far the tastiest sandwich I have ever eaten. Far better than the muffaletta from the Central Grocery in New Orleans which is a superb sandwich.\n\nI\'ve never lived nor attended school in Ithaca but I make the trip there every time I visit Binghamton - that horrendous city in a lovely landscape plagued by weird mercurial and often profoundly snowy weather - just to get Hot Truck. There\'s a cult of us really. We all go. I always get at least three sandwiches - one for immediately while it\'s hot; one for the road or that night at or after a party back in Binghamton; and one for the day after.\n\nI once left a Triple Sui hot & heavy wet & greasy (actual dressing terms slightly modified for grammatical sense) on my hotel room desk for two and a half days - obviously without refrigeration - and it was STILL the deliciousest most satisfying sandwich I have ever put into my belly via my mouth.\n\nIf you rated it fewer than five stars it must be because you did one or both of two things:\n\n(1) You dressed it with garden. If you enjoy food eating or sandwiches and respect yourself the world life or anything then shredded lettuce belongs nowhere on any sandwich ESPECIALLY a hot one. It\'s flavorless wilted slimy and disagreeably cool in the context of a warm hearty ribsticker. "I know. This Argentine hanger steak with chimichurri sauce seems like it\'ll hit the spot but you know what\'ll make it perfect? Some shredded lettuce on top but first give it time to wilt and slime. And mix in some Diet Tab with my Dom Perignon please."\n\n(B) You left off the grease. Unfortunately there is no instrumentation extant among the dread works of man that will measure how much this adds to the sandwich. And like I said I was not only none the worse for eating a two-day-old unrefrigerated sandwich with mayo I was made whole and augmented.\n\nThe irrational mystics have it wrong and have always done. The Triple Sui is the Great Redeemer. Hot Truck is Love.\n' u"As a few other people have pointed out the food is just average when you're sober. I can see how people would find it mindblowing when they're drunk but I'm the kind of person who believes that you can't call it great food if you have to be inebriated before you can find it amazing.\n\nThey have an interesting menu and you can see all the definitions for their stuff posted on their window. The guys who work here are pretty helpful with explaining the menu items if you need it.\n\nEat it ASAP. I waited ten minutes after picking it up before I bit into it and the cheese was already cold and hardening.\n" u"This was my only life source for food after a night of drinking.  I just remember freezing my butt off walking through the snow and standing there for eternity next to a red truck parked at the side of a street for a PMP.  Thank you for being there for me Hot Truck you gave me the best tasting pizza a drunk person can ever devour in one minute in the freezing cold.  Oh how I miss you so......not really cause I don't drink as much anymore.\n" u'As a civic service I am posting this review. HOT TRUCK IS OPEN (as of September 3rd 2015). They open at 9:30 pm Thursday-Saturday. While the PMP is delicious....my money is on the WGC. Rockin. Worth the trip up the hill.\n' u"The food is tasty but not exemplary. Every single sub is just a pizza stuffed in a sandwich. Although there are many different options on the menu they all essentially taste the same. The customer service is poor - the man at the window taking my orders usually seems annoyed that I'm there ordering food. The hours of operation are unclear and I've never been able to connect through telephone. The purpose of this truck just seems to be to prey on the inebriated college students living on west campus and the fraternities nearby.\n" u'Really good place with amazing cookers/cashiers\n\npretty much every thursday it is my ritual to go and get my big willy or a north baker and they never disappoint.  furthermore their location is really convenient and dont let me start on their schedule lol.\n\nI will miss this place once i graduate but in the meantime i will binge on it.\n' u"when my child starts on solid foods the first bite will be Hot Truck's Triple Sui.  It is that good\n" u"I really love the French Bread!!!! It's so crunchy and tasty. I am very sad that they don't open for lunch =((( otherwise I will definitely have their sub more often. I usually get sui with pepperoni. I've got the triple sui once a french bread sub with pepperoni meat balls sausage and a lot of cheese which was AWESOME. The PMP is good if you don't want any meat. Oh and the Moby Delight looks so good but I really don't want to finish one myself at the middle of the night. Again I really hope they can open in the day from time to time. \nUpdate: Tastes awesome but it's just too many calories.....\n" u'The inventor of the French bread pizza! Its decent late night greasy food but nothing particularly special if you eat it while sober.\n' u'PMP yum. Takes forever. Only open Thursday and weekend nights.\n' u"HOT TRUUUUUCK!! The sorority sisters and I were frequent visitors to this lovely establishment after many a night of haphazardly sliding through ice and snow after a night out... we usually could score standing waiting space in the front cab of the truck and get just AWESOME 4AM pizza. Get me a Krazy Korean Hot and Heavy please... *drool*\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell I used to make my own PMP's at home when the craving would hit but they were never the same...\n" u'MY LAST MEAL ON EARTH:\n\nFull Sui GnG BBQ - Toasted to Perfection Pizza Sub made with a half loaf of garlic bread tomato sauce homemade sausage mushrooms mozzarella cheese pepperoni crushed bbq chips (BBQ) lettuce and mayo (GnG = Grease and garden). \n\nThis place is special. I\'d consider naming my kid "the Hot Truck" it\'s so good. Seriously though last meal on earth at first I put down Risotto Ai Frutti De Mare or Hamachi Nigiri but you know what....this this would be it. A perfectly toasted Pizza Sub from the Hot Truck. Flaky easily crumbled exterior warm gooey flavorful interior. SOOOOO INSANELY GGOOOODDD (sigh).\n\nHot Truck 101:\nSince 1960 this truck has been serving some of the nation\'s best late night street food. The original owner Bob Petrillose created French bread pizzas so successful was his original idea that Stouffer\'s kitchen eventually copied it. It arrives quietly around 11pm each night on Stewart Ave. just below Cornell\'s West Campus and it remains open till just before day break. All walks of life; hard core studiers drunken frat boys engineering professors area residents and sometimes even escaped architects  swing by here for late night satisfaction.\n\nDuring my three and half years at Cornell I spent many nights warming up in the truck talking with Bob as the snow fell gently outside. Something was always  happening by the truck;  fights screaming matches impromptu acapella concerts passed out party goers streakers (literally butt ugly ones) rampant PDA...but no matter what was going on the food was always mind blowing. \n\nWe ate here so often that once we even gave up Hot Truck for lent. :)\n\nThis past October I went back (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KPSqZ737VWG5J2NRRLJZuw?select=H6-nC9NWQZnbc4bzKHe5gg) and was worried that it wouldn\'t be the same. It\'d been over eight years since I\'d returned and Bob had retired a few years ago. Well the place still ROCKS!!!....the menu\'s the same  the trucks the same and the pizza subs were even better than I remembered them.\n\n***The only real suggestion I have is to eat it outside....you\'ll understand.****\n\nThe Hot Truck has its own language I actual still have one of the original dictionaries...here\'s the basics:\n\n---The Subs---\n\nPMP = Poor Man\'s Pizza basically bread sauce and cheese\nSui = Suicide half loaf of garlic bread tomato sauce homemade sausage mushrooms mozzarella cheese pepperoni\nWGC =PMP but on garlic bread w/ less cheese\nRaRa ReRe RoRo = Different roast beef and cheese subs\nHaHa HeHe HoHo = Ham and swiss cheese subs \n(for both the Rs and Hs  a = pepperoni e = sausage o = mushrooms)\nThere\'s also MOBEY INDY KRAZY KOREAN SCOOBY SHAGGY SEP PEP TUNA SURPRISE KEN W.T.F.(whatever they feel like making) GUINEA PIG LITTLE SICILIAN "North Baker" "The Firm" .....have fun discovering your favorite.\n\n---A few terms to know---\n\n"Run it through the garden" = add lettuce\n"Grease and garden" = lettuce and mayonnaise\n"Liquid Heat" = Cayenne pepper sauce\n"Hot" =crushed red pepper\n"Heavy" = garlic\nPlus "W" "Sunshine" "Death" "Cut" "Mush" "BBQ"....\n\n\nWhen the world ends...find me here happily eating my Full Sui GnG BBQ Cut. Doesn\'t get any better than this at least not in this life time.\n' u'A good late night food truck to satisfy your cravings.  Not for when you are sober but a decent snack on your way home.\n\nTry the biggest sandwich with everything. You will eat all you can and make your roommates happy with the leftovers upon your return.\n' u'This came up on a random google search and I just had to write the review for the memories.\nStill the same place same food probably same guys.\n\nHalf Triple Suicide.  \nMade my night after many late night lab sessions.\n\nThanks for the memories guys.\n' u'HAWT Truck is a definite Institution for Cornell students. \n\nThe Stouffer\'s French Bread Pizza was apparently copied from its Poor Man\'s Pizza (PMP).\n\nAnd they have Suicide Pizzas (since Cornell is infamous for suicides although it actually doesn\'t have a higher rate than most colleges. We just tend to gather more press because of the gorges that students like to "experience". Personally while a beautiful view going down a painful and not guaranteed way to go) . \n\nMenu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KPSqZ737VWG5J2NRRLJZuw?select=Vo5wPQ99IA7QxbVAbyy25w\n\nThe "ambiance" of eating outside in the snow with sauce dripping on the ground is the key.\n\nNo angioplasty is NOT included with purchase but Gannett Health Services is just up the Hill. \n\nGet away you Adkins freaks vegetarians and vegans!\n\nhttp://www.seriouseats.com/required_eating/2007/02/the-hot-truck.html\n']
31.Spicy Asian,[u"Very convenient location right by my hotel and a walk distance. I haven't had spicy Chinese food for a while decided to give a try while stay in town. \nIt's a cozy environment waitress set me at a booth by the big drop down window. I ordered the baby bok Choy and spicy big hot pot (dry with shrimp lotus root celery and pork slice). The b-Choy has garlic added and hot pot get more shrimp flavored in with spice decorated. The downside I should've ask to remove the minced garlic but overall food is great.\nService is on point a great place to hangout with friends even want to try real authentic Chinese.\n" u"I thought I wouldn't be able to find authentic Chinese food in Ithaca. On the pricey side though (portions are quite small compared to other Chinese restaurants in the US for the same price). \n\nFood quality varies a bit. It's usually better during the school year. I went there once around Thanksgiving and the food was meh. \n\nService: terrible.\n" u"Showed up at 8:30 Sunday and they are closed. The sign said open until 10:00 pm. Not he first time. They just don't care.\n" u'Not tasteful food not pleasing atmosphere discrepancy between online and in store menu prices confusing staff underwhelming and overpriced food\n' u"Whenever someone asks me where to go for great food I always suggest they consult with Yelp based on where they are at any given moment and then parse the reviews. This is how we found Spicy Asian... once we arrived we checked Yelper's for menu suggestions which worked out great! We read the tips and ordered from the Szechuan menu. Which was superb! We split a dish shared some spring rolls and sipped the excellent tea. Quite a bargain! The next time we're in the area we will definitely come back!\n" u"The service is really what earned them this rating. Upon walking in they set a very awkward atmosphere. Rushed us to our table and didn't check back in for a while. Drinks were dreadfully slow to arrive and be refilled as well. \n\nThe food was pretty decent! Came out quick and hot\n" u'The inside is spacious and a good option for big parties. A lot of Chinese people would come to this place for its delicious and authentic Chinese food. \nFood comes in large portions. Most of them are spicy and tastes great.\n' u"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Ithaca and only place to quench my Szechuan food craving in Ithaca. Both Delivery and Dine-In are great options for this restaurant.\nI always get Zhong dumplings and sliced fish in chili sauce. \nI've also tried handful of dishes on the menu and I would also recommend the hot pot items and mapo tofu. It's a good place to go with for medium sized parties so that you can share and try lots of items.\n\nService is usually decent and food comes out at their appropriate speeds. The restaurant decor looks like it's a Chinese restaurant but everything's clean and doesn't look old or run down. \n\nI would definitely not give this restaurant 5 stars but because it's Ithaca I give it 5. And you can't get decent Szechuan food anywhere else in Ithaca.\n" u"This is supposed to be one of the best Chinese food in town.  When We came around 7:30 pm there were two large Chinese student groups and two or three small groups but only one waitress.  When we asked for a recommendation she couldn't recommend any dishes.  The hot tea was bad I couldn't drink it.\n\nWe ordered:\nSweet and sour soup: for the kid not impressive.\nDan Dan Noodle: looks very appealing taste was actually ok the texture is way too soft. My son said it's like when you took a bite you directly bite into your own teeth.\nCumin lamb: the lamb is pretty good.  Unfortunately 2/3 of the dish is raw lattice. Only a thin layer of cumin lamb was laying on top.  What Chinese dish has raw lettuce like the poorest grade of salad without dressing? Definitely not Sichuan.\nChinese bacon with snow peas: nothing extraordinary but ok.\nSalt and pepper squid: no taste other than being oily but with a thick layer of raw lettuce at the bottom again!\nChung King spicy chicken: this may be the best dish we ordered today.  Too bad that only a dozen or so chicken pieces were spotted among the peppercorns red peppers and garlic.\nWhole fish with black bean sauce: the fish is not fresh. The meat is very hard sticking to the bone and has no taste.\n\nPerhaps as a Chinese who can cook her own meal and a New Yorker who is accustomed to really good Chinese restaurants I am being a bit harsh to this restaurant.  However if you are a visitor to Ithaca I would recommend you try out some other cuisine styles.  There are other places with more authentic Chinese.  If you are a Cornell student and have no other places to go it's still ok to come occasionally.  Just remember your mom and dad can cook better meals than this.\n\nPrice: We paid about $100 for four people.  Considering the food quality the price is definitely not worth it.  We left with a lot of lettuce left on the plate.  I tend to overstuff myself with good food.  With this meal I'm happy to report that I've met the 70% full guideline for the first time.  In fact I might have eaten less than half of what I would have (I took two bites of the rice because I really had nothing to go with it) but I felt no desire to continue eating not that there were much left that was worth eating.\n\nService: I asked for a few napkins in the beginning. They finally arrived when we were finishing up with a couple reminders throughout.  Our water glasses were empty for a long time before they were filled.  Somebody with a tea pot showed up (I'm guessing it may be the owner) and asked if we wanted more tea and we asked for the check instead (meaning: way too late).\n\nI typically leave 20% tips but left only $5 this time just because it was too big of a let down.\n" u"I've been back many times and can't stand by my original assessment. \nSpicy Asian is a nice place to eat. Some of the dishes aren't as good as others if you don't like what you got try again later with a different dish.  \nThe Kung Pow Tofu is seriously amazing but be warned it's 50% dried chili peppers.\n" u'I ordered kung pao shrimp the picture looks very nice however it tastes sweet! Not spicy at all but sweet shrimp! Also I ordered toufu bao(\u8c46\u8150\u7172\uff09 2 tofu at top and all cabbages below with some mashroom y good just 2 piece of tofu. \nI fully reviewed all images and ratings before coming here with friends we are all very disappointed.\nWe also ordered \u6c34\u716e\u9c7c( water boiled fish) \u9f13\u6c41\u6392\u9aa8\uff0cthey taste very different the fish taste a bit sweet too not spicy at all and the ribs just terrible.\nThe service is pretty bad as well. \nHighly not recommended if u just visit here and stop by if u are in university here probably u do not have a choice for better chinese restaurant.\n' u'Great food especially on the Szechuan side on the menu.  One of the best Asian places in town - in a town with a lot of Asian food.\n\nVery ethinic.  You\'ll want to order different dishes to round-out a meal.  So go with friends and order several dishes.  Lunch menu is more "American style" though the dinner menu is always available.\n\nMany local/student asians dine here.  Sometimes crazy-busy in evening. Go early.\n\nPersonal favs: sliced fish and sour cabbage cumin beef/lamb/pork hot pots kung po Szechuan\n' u"For food I'd give them 4 stars. Great flavor good portion size plenty of vegetarian options - like general tso tofu (yum!) vegetable dumplings vegetable ho fun fried rice etc. Pricing is in line with other local Asian restaurants. \n\nThe issue I have is with the in-store experience. Twice we've eaten in and unfortunately table service was slow and inattentive on both occasions. Servers are just sort of indifferent bordering on grumpy. The booths are nice but they haven't consistently replaced the bulbs in their light fixtures so some are super bright which makes eating under them unappealing. On the plus side the tables are set with stainless steel chopsticks. \n\nTake out is always good so we'll keep ordering; just think we'll skip eating there in the future.\n\nNote: Closed on Mondays\n" u"Walking into the restaurant we were greeted promptly by the front cashier and waitress.  They both were friendly and led us to a booth by the window.  We liked the decor and the colorful menus.  We ordered crispy chicken wings Hunan beef and Pepper and Salt shrimp.  The crispy chicken wings were cut nicely and tasted ok.  The Hunan beef had a nice sauce but wasn't spicy.  The best dish was the Pepper and Salt Shrimp which was prepared spicy with Szechuan peppers.\n" u'On a Christmas afternoon when all the shops and eateries were closed spicy Asian was our savior. Authentic Chinese food served with decent hot sauces really found a gem. Decent seating and servicing amazingly soft tofu and rice. Every piece of this place screams authenticity. A good place and a Merry Christmas.\n' u"The food was decent but the service was horrible.  We came in at 4p and wanted to sit at a certain table and was told that we couldn't because they were reserving the table for larger parties.  They had seating for 60 and had about 8 customers.  Tell me why again that I can't sit there?  The waitress was snippy. \n\nAll in all I would never return.\n" u'Solid Chinese restaurant - can rival many of the Chinese places in Chinatown or Flushing NY. The garlic shrimp is excellent - rarely can you find a place that gives you shrimp larger than your pinky tip. Will definitely eat here again on my next trip back to Ithaca.\n' u"We love the lunch buffet.  It's a great meal at a great price.  The owner always stops by to say hi\n" u'My favorite Asian joint in Ithaca. The dishes are always fresh and hot. Their Tofu dishes are also top-notch.\n' u"We were visiting cornell university and this place was close to our hotel thus we went.\n\nThe food was ok but barely there was no service besides delivering the food. No water refill and we had to ask for anything we want. Like a spoon for my daughter.\n\nThe most crazy thing was that after we paid the bill. The bill included 15% tip already. Even though we didn't like the service  we decided to be nice and pay the 15% tip. Then the lady accused me of taking one of their rice bowl. The bowl was really small. I didn't know who would make use of it. This was not the point. I told her I didn't take it. But the lady looked at me untrusted. I felt really offended. I didn't feel this was the proper way to treat a customer.\n\nFelt really dissappointed with this place and the lady (looks like the owner?)\n"]
154.Chipotle Mexican Grill,[u"Love Chipotle! Only problem is the line. But I understand because the food is always delicious. It's a must for me whenever I go to Ithaca.\n" u'This is the worst Chipotle I\'ve ever been to. I love Chipotle but I will not be going to this location again which is unfortunate because it\'s the only one in this area. On my last visit I ordered online and chose 4:30pm as my pickup time. I arrived at the restaurant around 4:38pm to find that my order was not made yet--they had to make more fajitas. Long story short I didn\'t get my order for another 30 minutes. This was not acceptable so my husband asked for a free bowl. Instead he received a voucher for free chips and guacamole. I was not happy with this and went back inside to see if we could get a free bowl instead. I politely explained the situation and the cashier was receptive at first and got a card from the manager for a free bowl. When she came back she acted like I personally offended her by asking for the free bowl. She wouldn\'t take the other card back from me and held the other card out to me while turning her head as far as she could in the opposite direction. I had to put the other card on the counter for her because she wouldn\'t take it from me or speak to me (WTF?). I used to go to this Chipotle at least once a week (sometimes more) and I expect to be treated better than that. \n\nI was really pissed off at this point and I left thinking "Could this get any worse??" OF COURSE IT COULD! I got home 15 minutes later ready to eat still pissed off the dog\'s about to pee all over the place from waiting so long there\'s now a rift in my marriage etc. etc. We open the bowl and the order is completely wrong! The one time I didn\'t check the order before leaving they forgot to put salsa cheese guacamole and lettuce. I honestly could not believe it. I threw the bowl away because it literally had 3 things in it and called the manager who said he couldn\'t refund me unless I came back to the store. I still have not received my refund because I really don\'t want to go back there. The thought of Chipotle used to make me happy and now it just makes me very very pissed off. \n\nDon\'t think this is a unique situation--this location consistently gets my orders wrong about 50% of the time. If you order a chicken bowl expect to get it without chicken. That\'s how bad they are. \n\nPlease have somebody train that staff better. They seriously lack customer service skills (and reading skills).\n' u'As a rule of thumb I don\'t review chain restaurants simply because...What\'s the point? But in the case of the Chipotle in Ithaca it would be in poor taste as a frequent yelper to not leave a review about how horrible this particular location is. \n\nI have been to this Chipotle appox. 5 times since I moved to Ithaca this summer. Each time my visit has been met with multiple mishaps mess ups and overall mismanagement. \n\nThe first time I went it took me about 15 minutes to make it through a line of 4 people on a Friday midday.\n\nThe second visit they were out of chicken. \n\nMy third and most memorable visit (up until tonight) was when they were out of lettuce corn cheese and guacamole. Luckily I was able to get the last of the rice before they ran out of that. The mother in line in front me so enraged at their lack of essential ingredientsshe threw one of the most absurd temper tantruns about what "s***y service" they have. Best part she had her 2 young sons with her. The end result was her saying she didn\'t want the 2 build your own taco orders her sons had already asked for so they had to throw the last remnants of the white rice in the trash....I wanted to laugh but I also wanted to hug her because only after waiting in line for about 20 minutes and making it to the front did they let us know they had barely any ingredients available. I have been to many other chipotles where there are signs clearly saying what they\'re out of or even having an employee work to the back of the line and let people know in advance what limitations they have....none of that happened at this chipotle. \n\nMy fourth visit again was an excruciatingly long wait coupled with poor service. I\'m pretty confident they were out of something too. Almost every visit they are. \n\nTonight\'s visit was my 5th? 6th? But will definitely be my last. I arrived around 6:45 to a long line. Not surprising as this is prime visit time...I finally made it to the front of the line somewhere around 7:15. A flustered and grumpy girl stared at me while I relayed my order...next was toppings...as per usual they were out of things. I had to wait for fajitas and there was no more corn. Luckily I was able to have the browned scraps of guac that were left in the bottom of the pan....unfortunately for the person behind me they would have none as "they were still working on making a new batch". REALLY? YOU\'RE KNOWN FOR YOUR GUAC. GET IT TOGETHER. Lastly both the eating areas and the ordering station were so DIRTY! Ingredients were spilling into other sections and it just look bad overall from a presentation standpoint. \n\nI finally made it to checkout where what I\'m going to assume was the manager nastily took my card told me my total and shoved my food at me.\n\nNot a single smile not a single apology for the wait no apology or notification for the lack of ingredients. Nothing\n\nAt this point I\'m done with the Ithaca Chipotle. Where I used to live I would get it at least once a week. Now Chipotle will be reserved only for when I travel out of town.\n\nTonight I told myself before going I would try to go in with an open mind but after waiting 30 minutes for the same thing as every time before I feel like to fool for giving them another 10 bucks for a mediocre meal.\n' u"I come here pretty much every week. I look forward to it after dealing with Cornell classes. It's a Chipotle - so if you like Chipotle in general you'll like it here too. The ingredients generally taste very fresh and the food safety outbreaks that affected the chain recently don't concern me too much. I know that they are constantly working to make sure that the food is safe to eat while still maintaining freshness.\n\nI will say though that this location seems quite understaffed at times especially when there's a u-shaped line practically going up to the register. They simply need more people on the assembly line behind the ingredients.\n\nAlso they need to be cleaning more often as other reviewers mentioned. It's not appetizing to see food scraps on tables (and even chairs) before you sit down to eat. And it's not fun to clean it off yourself.\n\nBut yeah there's a reason I come back weekly. And it's because the food is so damn good. I think that's really what matters in the end.\n" u'For the most part this Chipotle is like any other and although I\'ve been a fan of the chain for a decade-plus the corporate policies are really beginning to annoy me. Primarily for this reason I am reviewing this with a single star.\n\nFirst the problems with this location:\n\nYou can almost bet there will be a line to the door and your wait could be as much as 20 minutes before you even get to the counter.\n\nThe ambiance is loud and the tables and floors are often dirty. \n\nThe counter service is mostly adequate but sometimes indifferent or rude.\n\nThe place is often overrun with college students which accounts for some of the above problems.\n\nThe food is standard Chipotle but they often have OUTAGES which brings me to my primary gripe:\n\nDear Chipotle if you are out of rice (both white & brown at the same time) and you put a sign on the door saying so and there are 2 DIFFERENT SUPERMARKETS less than one-tenth of a mile away not only do you look like idiots but you are telling the public counter-productively that your customers don\'t matter and that you don\'t mind putting your employees in uncomfortable and embarrassing positions.\n\nI say counter-productive because I\'m sure the supposed reason for not sending an employee real quick to go buy some rice is that you\'re protecting the standardization of your customers\' experience. But like the woman in line next to me said "Because Chipotle rice is so much better than any other rice."\n\nFix your outage policies and consider supporting the local economy once in awhile when you run out of your corporate-standard shipped-in supplies.\n\nOr continue to look like jerks.\n\nNext time our family is going to Moe\'s.\n' u"Wildly inefficient as well as inconsiderate to the customers. After patiently waiting in a line which you can always expect to be long (which is fine) I would hope to be treated with an ounce of personal attention when finally getting to the front. A hectic and flustered staff managed to make us feel awkward and confused and failed to give us what we wanted. One worker tried to ask me if I wanted the same items as the stranger in line ahead of me and then asked the man behind my boyfriend if he wanted the same thing as him weirdly pairing us off with separate people we didn't know confusing everyone and not even listening to us when we tried to ask for what we wanted as individuals. My boyfriend got no vegetables at all and I got a heaping mound of spicy salsa when I asked for only a small amount. She seemed annoyed and frustrated with everyone in line and in her attempt to be more efficient just screwed everything up. I ended up eating my meal in anger rather than enjoying the food.\n" u"NOTE: This review is not an assessment of the quality of food at Ithaca's only Chipotle. I am a loyal customer of Chipotle: I used to eat it 5 times a week back in my hometown. \n\nThis 1 star review is solely directed at the management and efficiency of the staff. In the 20 or so locations I've been to this is the only one that has made me frustrated time and time again over its speed of service. I would see one server get the rice and meat then proceed to also get the salsa while another worker literally stands aside watching. I've seen the cashier back up to fill a bowl with veggies while leaving 3-4 customers who were ready to go hanging at the register. Each step of the assembly line simply needs to be faster and each employee need to stick to his or her own work in line. Henry Ford didn't popularize the assembly line to have workers doing each other's jobs.\n\nCHIPOTLE DIRECTORS: you may think this place is doing just fine since you have a great product and a great brand. You may also think that this store is doing well as the only Chipotle in this location. Please know that for every two times I an avid chipotle consumer enter those doors there is another time when I turn around at a half filled restaurant because even that will amount to a 30 minute wait. There are many others who do this. It's time to change something.\n" u'Slowest chipotle I\'ve been to. Actually slower than most fast casual fast food restaurant. I don\'t think they understand the "fast" part of this business as there\'s a line of about 20 people with just 2 workers making the food....while 4 others are floating around. They definitely get the "casual" part though.\n' u"If you like Chipotle then food-wise there are no surprises here. It tastes good they use clean ingredients and they have plenty of options for vegetarians: tofu two kids of vegetarian beans grilled veggies super-tasty guacamole ($$$) white and brown rice. \n\nServers are friendly food is good prices are on the high side lines are long but all of that is  expected for Chipotle. \n\nOn the plus side this location has outdoor seating and the plates are recyclable.\n\nWhere this Chipotle falls short is cleanliness. Every time we've been in the floors tables and napkin/utensil/soda area are filthy. If they'd step up their cleaning game we'd visit more often. Sitting outside or getting your food to go is the only comfortable option.\n" u'Yikes. I placed a phone order and the employee I spoke to was aggressively rude. When I went in to pick up the order I asked the employee at the register if I could to speak to the manager. He instead went to the person I had talked to on the phone who came out of the kitchen yelling "What? You saying I wasn\'t nice to you? You saying I wasn\'t nice to you?"\n\nAfter pointing out that this behavior was also rude I had to again ask to speak to the manager. The employee at the register refused  to get him and said "He\'s busy slicing avocadoes right now." \n\nWhen the manager finally came out he did not apologize for the phone employee\'s behavior. \n\nThe tone for employee behavior is set by  management.\n\nIt is pretty hard to make going to Chipotle a bad experience but somehow Ithaca\'s Chipotle accomplished the impossible.\n' u"Go to Moes or Viva. I've seen people go on and on about chipotle on Facebook sometimes and I can't fit it in my head why. Every time we have gone there the meat is overcooked atmosphere is beat the service is blah and the food is weak at best. I mean really chipotle doesn't hold a candle to other places.\n" u"Better to go to Viva in downtown. There are long lines sometimes and the food doesn't seem to be worth it.\n" u'I lied. I did go back. \nChipotle is offering Tofu now they call it "sofritas".\nThere\'s still cilantro in everything.\n' u'If I still lived in Los Angeles this place would be lucky to get 3 stars but its Ithaca and the Mexican/southwest eateries are just atrocious so they get a sympathy star. The meat is always grilled well and they pretty much do anything you ask for.\n\npro tip if you like a more flavorful burrito get multiple kinds of salsa. I go with mild + corn + hot.\n' u'Food was ok up to standard but staff made sure to make the experience bad. The line was really long as usual however it was due to one member of the staff that sassed customers. He sprinkled the cheese on my burrito in no hurry. After putting on two toppings he mentioned "is that it?" like he wanted me to go away and when I politely asked for sour cream muttered something in another language. He also folded my burrito like a scrunched up shirt and dumped a sad amount of guac on the side of the mountain of toppings. The cashier also rather rudely asked what was in my burrito. Trust me I\'m usually pretty ok with mediocre service but this was a whole new level of bad. Worse than McDonald\'s.\n' u"Well the food was good but that's about it. The service was mediocre at best. I took major offense to how the topping guy was conducting his business. First off he sprinkled the cheese onto my burrito as if he was making a gourmet pizza resulting in half the usual amount. When I asked for a bit more salsa he filled up the spoon dumped 90% of it out and the remaining drop was placed on my burrito. The burrito ended up being about half as full as it usually is. On top of all this the bag of chips was like 80% air trash cans were overflowing and the majority of tables were dirty. Love Chipotle but this restaurant needs to step it up.\n" u'This Chipotle was very good although I couldn\'t hear the servers over the loud music and because they seemed to be speaking very quietly. Also the dining area is very "no frills" but the food is worth it. There are vegan options and it all seems relatively fresh. I liked the free water with lemon option which is self-serve and tasty!\n' u"Chipotle so there's not much to say here: lots of polished wood stainless steel surfaces with small amount of seating. I am a big fan of Chipotle and love the high quality of the items they use in their food.  I always make a few trips to Ithaca because its the close one from Corning sadly.\n" u"So I walked in and a lot of the tables were dirty and there were 5 people working behind the counter. Granted I don't care that much cause we found a clean spot but should there have been a crowd I would've probably ate in my car. We had never been here before so I had a lot of questions about the choices. We walked up and were ignored for about 3-4 minutes as the workers who were in plain sight 2 feet away just talked among themselves and were flirting with what seemed to be the new girl worker. Granted I was a teen and had no professionalism at one point so again I didn't care but waiting for 4 minutes for food standing right there with almost no one else in the restaurant was pretty rude.\n\nAnyways once they stopped talking and asked me what I wanted the guy did answer all of my questions and was quite nice about it. They definitely fill up your burrito and it's crazy how much they can fit in and still roll it. The guac was really good the rice beans and meat were crazy good and the lettuce and salsa definitely tasted fresh. One of the better burrito's I have ever had and it was quite filling.\n\nThe only other thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the prices. They are a bit high but again I have to constantly remind myself this is Ithaca nothing is inexpensive.\n\nOverall I'd go back maybe not to this one in particular but when I am in Binghamton I'd try theirs. I might go back here if I was really in the mood but Viva is cheaper and a bit better in my opinion. If the service was better I'd be more inclined to go here rather than viva but viva always has great service (and clean tables).\n\nI'd definitely recommend you at least try it it's very filling and very good but not enough for me to really want to return if the service and area was how it was this time.\n" u'What the f Chipotle. $10 and 15-20 minutes in line for a burrito with like 4 ounces of filling?? Not cool.\n']
158.Dapper‚Äôs Restaurant,[u'Cheaper to come here before ten but the process are still good for Sunday brunch.  I have only been here for Sunday brunch.  Food is ok not gourmet but it is a local favorite.\n' u"Good quality.  Attentive staff. A little hard to find if not for the area (bc it's in the ramada and no signs).\n" u'My wife and I went to dappers for breakfast this morning food was good service was excellent a dramatic price increase almost 4$ per person more. Needless to say we are not going back because of the price honestly a small increase is reasonable bit almost 50% na. Good like lower to a reasonable price we will come back\n']

20.The BoatYard Grill,[u"Great for our party of 8 without a reservation. Shrimp & grits was solid kids had plenty to choose from nice high-casual environment. We'll be back!\n" u"The decor of the restaurant was cute and charming but that's about the only positive aspect. The service was decent and the view nice but the food was not worth the price.\n\nMy boyfriend got the New York strip the steak was extremely fatty and the fries that came with the steak were cold and way hard they seemed more like chips in the shape of fries. \n\nI got the miso glazed sword fish which was overcooked and drenched in the glaze which was extremely salty and overpowering.\n\nWe were very disappointed in our meal and will not return. Would not recommend boatyard at all plenty of other interesting and delicious options around.\n" u"The food here sucks. All 6 of us who ordered different things thought the food didn't taste good. I consider my cooking skills to be way below par and even I think I can cook a better meal than this restaurant. The steak was dry and cold. The moment it was served I knew by the look of the steak that it would taste bad. The potatoes were good though. The view is also nice. I'd only come back for drinks and appetizers.\n" u'As Cornell Men\'s Hockey season ticket holders we had a nice coupon for a free Big Red Burger. Having expectations for a juicy handmade burger and being served what we received it was a complete let down to say the very least. \n\nThe picture of the burger on the ticket is a nice thick burger dressed to the nines with all the toppings lettuce tomatoes etc. when I found out I had to pay for lettuce and tomatoes I was surprised but said no big deal. \n\nNow we talk about the burger. First the waitress whisked the coupons off the tables and said "2 Big Red Burgers?"  We said yes then she walked to the ordering station and we completed our order while she was at the station. She never asked us how we wanted them cooked if we wanted cheese etc. when the burger arrived and we started eating them we realized they were absolutely disgusting frozen patties. I didn\'t even eat half of mine. The waitress never even asked if we wanted them packed up or if it was ok. \n\nNeedless to say an extremely disappointing trip and will probably not go back. Absolutely not for a burger anyway.\n' u'We were looking forward to dining here after a Cornell hockey game on a Sunday eve - pretty quiet inside it appeared.\nService slow.  I ordered the salmon " go naked" with 2 vegetables rather than the rice & veg .. not too impressive& certainly not worth the price with only several small florets of broccoli & 2 wimpy stems of asparagus - fish unimpressive.\nSeared ahi tuna dinner was delicious & seemed fresh!\nMahi mahi dinner ok but rice clumpy.\nHad to go find waitress to get our check to leave after waiting awhile for her appearance.\nSpoke with the manager re service - gracious  she offered us coupons for a return visit... \nDon\'t think we will return anytime soon- very disappointing ....\n' u"Beautiful location and dining room with large windows. There's so much potential here. \n\nDespite not having a reservations policy you can call ahead and more than likely they will be able to save a table for you. I did this on a Friday before graduation and had a 0 wait time which was great.\n\nThe calamari we ordered was great - crisp and not overly chewy. Good sauces to go with as well. The presentation though could be a lot better instead of just pouring the sauce onto the plate.\n\nMy swordfish tacos sounded like a good idea - avocado sauce pico de gallo....only the flour tortilla was cold (not even grilled/reheated) and the fish while nicely grilled was way too fishy. \n\nMy friend's wood grilled salmon looked very good though - maybe the fish there would be fresher?\n\nThis was only my first time so Boat Yard Grill still has another chance. But little bits and pieces of the restaurant just make me feel like a lot of things are overlooked and the management of the restaurant is not yet catered toward high quality and customer satisfaction.\n" u'Buffalo chicken eggrolls had tendons and bone in it. Didn\'t even take it off our bill.\n\n"Call ahead seating" is pointless just don\'t offer it at all.\n\nUPDATE: I don\'t know if having bones and tendons in an egg roll amounts to "not quite my liking". I think it\'s pretty generally accepted that such impurities do not belong in an /egg roll/\n' u"Came here for a team dinner and the service was great; the food...not so much. I don't know how anyone could mess up rice but they messed up rice. My hypothesis is that they tried to salvage leftover rice in the microwave? It had a confusing gross variety of mushy and hard chunks. My salmon was okay though and everyone else seemed to have enjoyed their food. \nThe restaurant gets super crowded on Saturdays so plan to get there earlier (they had apparently run out of some entrees that day). Anyways I think people come here more for the fancier atmosphere than the food. The best part of this restaurant is the location; it's a great place enjoy some decent food and a nice view of Cayuga lake!\n" u'We would actually give a 3.5 stars but that was not an option. Service was good. Fries were great. Gutenberger was good to very good. Fish tacos were very good. Lobster flat bread was good - could have been great if the crust was crispy. Lots of potential at this restaurant. The chef or owner just has to kick it up a notch and fine tune some recipes.\n' u"Excellent dining experience here recently! I came here with my extended family so there was 5 adults and 2 children. The staff was very friendly and ac adapting for a larger group. We arrived shortly after the opened and that helped we didn't have to wait long for a beautiful large table by a fireplace and beautiful view of the harbor. The atmosphere and decor was spot on cosy feel with some nautical flare! \n\nNow on to the best part the dinner! We all had different meals. An appetizer of calamari which was cooked the perfect amount and had the best flavor. I ordered a small Caesar salad and the wood fire chicken pasta in a small plate. (Really love they offer a selection of small plates for a few dollars cheaper but it also allows you to order a few different things so you can enjoy more things!) my husband enjoyed a side salad and cup of clam chowder and small plate of ribs. All of it he enjoyed and he really loved the BBQ ribs the BBQ sauce was a great flavor and the meat was falling off the bone! My brother in law enjoyed some scallops and my mom enjoyed the surf and turf. My mom loved the surf and turf she said the filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the lobster was delicious! The two kids enjoyed cheeseburgers and fries the burgers were so huge they looked the size of an adult burger! \n\nBasically a must try spot for a lovely dinner out with a great atmosphere! I can't wait to be back in the area to come back and enjoy more great food!\n" u'Mark thank you for the acknowledgement.  We have conversed on multiple occasions and you have been very friendly and kind. To answer your question we enjoy the scallops very much! Being from Boston we are a costumed to good fresh seafood which we have enjoyed each time we have visited your establishment.\n' u"I've dined here twice. My family and I have come Ithaca the first week in July for the past two years and have come here each year. I can't say enough great things about this place. There are a few things that makes a dinner an enjoyable experience. The atmosphere the food the service the price and of course the location. This restaurant in my opinion scored high in almost all of these areas.\n\nThe atmosphere at The Boatyard Grill is great. It suits my tastes for the most part. The restaurant is decorated well and quite clean. No issues there. This location also has a nice patio that is covered as well right by the river. A perfect setting if the weather is just right.\n\nThe food is incredible. My wife has had the fish tacos my father the scallops and myself a shrimp dish. All were cooked perfectly with great seasoning too. Without any difficulties the folks here cooked my mothers meal according to her food allergies and did so without error which was very much appreciated.\n\nThe service was excellent. The staff wear their uniforms professionally and act the same. It's quite nice to feel like an actual customer. No issues there if anything they excel at customer service.  \n\nThe prices are definitely fair and I think on par with other restaurants of its class. It is pricey though but you definitely get your money's worth in service and quality of food.\n\nLocation wise this place is slightly tricky to get to. Being from Canada I couldn't begin to tell you exactly how to get here but I do know it's tucked away down a little street and definitely a good find when you make your way here to this spot. Not to mention being on the water and having what appears to be a little parkette attached to it. This place rocks.\n" u'The Mrs. and I dined here during our stay in wine country.  They sat us outside in the covered dining area.  We both were in the mood for seafood.  I had the swordfish and she had the salmon.  Both were very good.  The wine they had on the menu complimented the dinners well.\n\nIt was a good dinner but not over the top outstanding.  I would definitely recommend and would return next time in the area.\n' u'Great location with wonderful views..The service was great and the food was excellent .\n' u'We live in the Pocono Northeast but find ourselves in Ithaca about every other month. This is our usual spot for dinner when we go.\n4 stars for location and service...maybe 3.5 stars for the food which seems to be hit or miss. I agree with the other comments about the buffalo chicken egg rolls (often so good!) but again hit or miss. Last night we went with friends and these were bland.\nThe servers are always wonderful and the setting is perfect. We are regulars.\n\nIn response to Mr Miller: I love the wood fired chicken and pasta and my husband often chooses a special. Thanks for responding we really love stopping in!\n' u'Had a lovely dinner at the crowded and popular boat yard. Staff was friendly and accommodating\nPrices were reasonable and portions nice\n' u'Been here several times.  The location is fantastic.  The decorating theme is a bit too kitschy.  There is a nice sized bar and a decent beer and wine selection.  The food is good not great.  Service has always been good.  I think this is a 3.5 stars kind of place.  I would like to see them remodel the decor and update the menu to move into this decade but still on my rotation.  I recommend for its nice location.  I will return.\n' u"The food is really quite good; at the same time it's inexpensive. Service was good and the same for the atmosphere.\n\nOverall inexpensive for quite good food!\n" u"This doesn't even deserve one star.  Can't believe anyone wd give it any stars.  Coming from NY the food wasn't even palatable. Never ever order the eggplant parmagian.  Or  the wood fired pasta chicken dish which wasn't wd fired and had absolutely no taste or spices whatsoever.   \nWill never\n" u"Here for #ICFamilyWknd with our freshman student and had THE infamous Gutenberger Burger and the Maker's Mark Sirloin....all to rave reviews. The view and the venue was lovely and inviting. We'll definitely be back over the next 4 years.\n"]
185.Subway,[u'The woman was rude. She yelled at me while I was ordering and messed up my order. Told me there was no tomatoes even though there were some in plain site. Gave me the wrong dressing. The lettuce seemed to be old. Think I got cucumbers instead of pickles\n']
163.Sicilian Delight,[u'Poor quality pizza with disrespectful staff. Yup authentic sicilian pizzaria.\n\nIf you want cold wings and pizza that tastes like the stuff you used to get at a school cafeteria then go for it.\n' u'Burnt Pizza for a low price of $20. I went back to return it the older gentlemam had offered to make more but i was so grossed out i declined. They put pepperoni in separate and it looked cheap and disgusting. I went back for a refund the young man at the counter copped an attitude. The poor young lady was in the middle of it they had refunded me but I felt the annoyance of the male employee. Never going back.\n' u'This is probably the most overpriced pizza joint that exists. I do not mind paying for food that is good. This place is just not serving good food. If you enjoy cold pizza this is the place for you. One star is the best I can do.\n' u"The service is great and the people there are really nice but the only good food there are their Pepperoni Rolls Spinach Rolls Fried Dough and Their Famous Garlic Knots. The prices are reasonable. My only complaint is that they charge for refills but the have the drink machine set up so you get it yourself and not them. That didn't make since to me.\n" u"Great if you want cold pizza. This used to be my favorite place to go for pizza but it's really gone downhill in the past year or two. I can't remember the last time I had anything hot there. Pizza is always cold and the Stromboli is cold inside. I have tried it over and over with the hope that they would improve and turn into the place I remember but I think those days are long gone. Time to find a new place in town.\n" u"This place used to be awesome when a guy named Norm used to work there and make the food and serve it. He left about 2 years ago and I've slowly watched this place go way down hill. The food is pretty much the same as always but the service is god awful. For instance I went there today and it will be my last time the woman working behind the counter dropped the sauce for my Calzone. I watched it open up she literally picked it back up and put it back on my tray.\n\nThey also have some fear of food trays too. You can order four plates of food and they expect you to carry it with all eight of your arms or something. You have to always ask for a tray when they give you one it's just plain filthy. If you complain they get all pissed and offended. Just ridiculous don't go there take a short drive down to Ned's for better service. If you really want good pizza in Ithaca go to Napoli.\n" u'This place deserves more than 1 review and also 3 stars. \n\nAs a native Ithacan this place has remained one of the top places in the mall to get decent food. \n\nIf this place had a location in downtown Ithaca I would eat here more often. But if you\'re at the mall grab a slice. It satisfies and is probably the best New York style "mall pizza" you\'ll find.\n' u"This place sucks. They burned our pizza and then when they offered to make a new one the person didn't even make one. One of the employees felt bad and warmed up the window one for us. And we didn't get our money back nor a discount coupon.\n" u"There's a reason I'm the first person drafting a review of this place: it's located in the center of the mall. Nobody wants to carry a pizza through a mall that is if you're the type of person who also thinks wearing sweatpants in public is a crime against man. I did this the first week I came to school a few years ago and I suppose the pizza was okay. It is really cheap so it got that going for it. There's nothing else redeemable about this place. Eat here if you work in the Holloween shop in the mall otherwise go elsewhere.\n" u'We ordered pizzas ahead of time last night to keep the costs down (We learned that they charge $4 for a slice of pizza with two toppings so we decided to NOT order by the slice. Maybe that was with tax. But still.). We picked them up at the time we said we would and they were tepid at best.  The stromboli we ordered was actually cold. Cold! This place has gone so downhill. Where is the quality control? The care? The love? The passion? Does the owner not work on site?\n' u"OK. My top 2 pics for pizza in Ithaca is this place and Sal's downtown.  Sicilian Delight has been around since the inception of the mall and they offer a great tasting pie Very reliable and quick. They do call in and pick up. I think if they existed in Ithaca and had a sit down it would thrive. As the first review pointed out who wants to lug a pizza box or boxes through a mall? Also parking and then the walk in and out through the mall is a disadvantage as well. This one is a good pizza house though and they are nice people who take pride in their product.\n"]
202.Subway,[u'Guaranteed to be missing almost every ingredient you want every time. They need to work on their inventory issues.\n' u'Extremely rude service. Employees ignore you and then yell at you. This has happened on multiple occasions. Will not be back.\n' u'Service was terrible. Lady has an extremely repulsive attitude. Story is just dirty and unkept in general. Would NOT recommend.\n' u"Worst Subway ever!! Service is pooor! A girl charged me extra money and thought I wouldn't realize!!!\n" u"What can I say?...Its Subway.\n\nS-ickening\nU-nbearable\nB-acterial\nW-oebegone\nA-crid\nY-OLO don't come in unless you've completed your list of things to do before you die.\n"]
78.Old Mexico,[u"I like Old Mexico because you can actually talk and hear what others say.  That and the on-site parking are just the beginning.  The wait staff are SO friendly and the food is delicious.  I liked the taste of the salsa which was thin but delicious.  I'd love to have more choices on the combos (and fixings like rice beans and lettuce/tomato/guacamole/sour cream on the side) and to have a bean and cheese burrito option.  The margaritas are great.  A welcome alternative to Viva.\n" u"Old Mexico is your typical Mexican restaurant. They are usually packed with customers which is a great sign. My boyfriend enjoyed him meal. However i was craving some authentic pastor tacos and their version was nothing close to what i've enjoyed in Mexico. Overall we'd go backgor simple texmex meals.\n" u"I much preferred Garcia's to this place. Generous portions but uninspired. Salsa given with chips is not homemade and much of the food seems to be straight from a can... Yes Viva's is not authentic but at least it is fresh made and tasty. I would recommend that you go there instead otherwise visit the Garcia's in Cortland.\n" u"Despite having had mediocre food there before I was in the mood for Mexican for lunch so I stopped in. Found a number of people waiting to be seated. After several minutes standing there one party left. After a few more minutes a woman came out of the back and tended to some business at the wait station then disappeared back into the kitchen. At that point we all looked at each other and left. We even told two incoming parties that they weren't seating people and THEY turned around.\n\nHey Old Mexico - you have to seat people and sell them food in order to stay in business. Just a little tip.\n" u"Pretty much your average Mexican restaurant. Not that that's a bad thing. Nothing out of the ordinary though. \n\nDelicious food. Endless chips and salsa and an extensive list of margaritas and of course good luck saving room for dessert! \n\nDefinitely worth a try if you love Mexican food.\n" u"Your average Mexican restaurant which stands out in an area that is shockingly poor when it comes to good Mexican food. Fajitas tacos and combo plates are good and the chips are endless but the salsa is to be desired. However my girlfriend and I really liked the pico - it was some of the best we've ever had. This is a huge restaurant that seems to go on forever and try to get a seat away from the bar because the area smells like stale beer.\n" u'Delicious inexpensive Mexican food.\nTortillas chips were warm at 9p salsa was mild not chunky but tasted great. Sangria glass was huge and service was very attentive. Will definitely go back as we usually stay at hotel next door when visiting.\n' u'Nice and friendly place. Lots of combos - and willing to substitute to make any fish vegetarian. Very reasonably priced. I had a combo with Chilli Relleno an enchilada and a taco. Dessert was churros with Apple stuffing and caramel sauce.\n' u'Lots of food - average quality.  \n\nWent here with a group of people on a visit to Ithaca. Big place - easy to get seated. Food portions are very big - out of 12 of us; I think only 1 person finished (although many of us pigged out on the chips/salsa beforehand). Quality was so-so. I had the diablo burrito - wasn\'t all that spicy (supposed to be); food taste was more "chain style" than authentic. The margaritas were tasty; but lower on alcohol than most. Most people in our group found it filling; and not bad - but not something to highly recommend.\n' u'I grew up in Texas. If there is anything I miss the most from my childhood... it might be the Mexican food. Since moving to New York oh so many years ago I have only found three places I would label as good authentic Mexican food and this is one of them. I am not in Ithaca often but I look forward to dining here again.\n' u"Second visit was a good one! Still a little slow but we weren't in a hurry. Everything was fresh & delicious. Service was friendly. Salsa is super yummy. Vegetarian burrito was excellent.\n" u'Still going through some opening-week growing pains as of 6/30 but the food is very good and I will definitely be going back to taste other things on the menu. Have some patience with them as they work out the kinks--the servers and management are definitely eager to please.\n\nChips and salsa are fresh and nice and several of the "classic" menu items we tried (burritos tacos chile relleno chimichanga tamale beans & rice) are very nicely done and dramatically more authentic Mexican food than can be had anywhere else in Ithaca. Beats Viva by a mile.\n\nFull bar plus bottle and draft beer. Ithaca Green Trail on tap along with some Mexican regulars.\n' u"I only give it 2 stars since I have had tons of great authentic Mexican and this might be 4 stars for Ithaca standards but I am not from Ithaca. The salsa was like tomato sauce in a dish. The chips tasted stale. The burrito had more beans and rice and tiny tiny portion of what they called carne asada but we all know it wasn't cooked like carne asada and it tasted nothing like it. Sorry for the bad review but would love to see an improvement since it has potential.\n" u'Decent food - nothing incredible but good and not expensive. Chips and salsa upon arrival and the chips were still warm. Yum! Our waitress was great! Really nice and welcoming. Good low-cost food.\n' u'Coming from California this is the closest you can get to good Mexican food in Ithaca. I still prefer the margaritas at Viva and Agave but the food at Old Mexico is much much better! (And they give free chips and salsa) I recommend the carnitas\n' u'I like Old Mexico better than Viva for Mexican in Ithaca. It is more flavorful and spicy and the portions are better.\n\nThere is a parking lot which is great because I hate street parking. \nThe menu is huge and there are tons of options.\n\nPrices are really good as well. \n\nService was fast and attentive.\n' u"Ithaca does not have any good Mexican restaurants (haven't tried the food truck yet) however Old Mexico could change that. My partner and I decided to give Old Mexico a try on a Friday evening. We were promptly seated but service was a tad slow. The chips and salsa were good and my Margarita was perfect for the price (4.99). They do have happy hour every day (4-6?) and you can get margaritas for $2.99. My partner had fajita nachos and I had street tacos. We enjoyed our food and felt that we got more than we paid for. Overall a pleasant experience. We will be back.\n" u"This was easily the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at. I tried the Combo Gordo so I sampled 90% of their food at one go... and I was very disappointed. \n\nThe tamale enchilada's and burrito contained the same meat ground beef (which should have been my first warning). The flavor was intense and reminded me of the taco seasoning found at a grocery store but multiplied by 10.\n\nOverall the food was something I would have made for myself if I was starving after a long day of school... in the third grade. And all this wonderful food for only $18.50! Tax not included.\n" u'Not bad. The prices were very affordable and you get a ton of food. You will not leave hungry. The service was not bad. Our waitress was friendly but a little flaky (dropping stuff forgetting stuff etc.) but not unforgivable.\n\nThe food was a tad bland and of lower quality. The burrito I got was covered with melted cheese and "burrito sauce" which I think was just ketchup.\n\nI\'d probably go back and give them another try anyway.\n' u"I visited in their first week of operation and they are already doing many things right. It was a busy dinner time on a weeknight and we were seated and served as promptly as the staff could manage. Waiting wasn't bad because everyone at the table really liked the homemade salsa. The waitstaff is trying hard and helpful. Most things about the menu were good but the vegetarian options seemed poorly thought through and much less coherent than the rest of the menu. \n\nI plan on going back once the initial crowds have calmed down. I'm hoping that they'll include a few more veggie combos in the menu so I'll have more options. That could make me a happy regular.\n"]
33.Cafe Pacific,[u'As has been said previously a hidden gem in collegetown! Delicious unagi don and the woman who was working there whenever I have gone (not sure if she was the owner or not) was extremely kind. Interesting variety of deserts and snacks by the counter and a charming atmosphere. Comfort food for cold Ithaca winters.\n' u'Hidden gem in ctown for inexpensive but large portions - I usually go for the yakinikudon. The owner is also so friendly and sweet.\n' u"Japanese gem in Ithaca located in Collegetown right by Cornell campus. The owner Hoshino is very nice. I mainly wrote this review to let people know that Fumi is not the owner! Not sure why everyone likes her so much..she was not nice to me because I worked there and was not Japanese. She no longer works there but employees are usually Asians (girls) who go to Cornell University or Ithaca College.\n\nSince I worked here I tried everything on their menu. Love Cafe Pacific for their desserts (mochi cheesecakes molten lava cake) Purity ice cream (green tea black raspberry) and affordable Japanese food. My go-to's for entrees are the Sansai soba yakisoba sukiyaki when it's cold out and tofu salad when I want something light. If you go to Cornell Cafe Pacific is in the middle of all the restaurants/apartments/houses so take your time trying everything on the menu and make sure to get a punch card.\n" u"If I had to choose 1 corner store for the rest of my life this would be it. This place is so cute and has all the delicious Japanese treats from my childhood. They also have a pretty substantial food selection for lunch or dinner cooked fresh to order. The dining space is a little ragged and stuffy (temperature-wise) but it adds to the overall personality. The owner and chef is super friendly chatty and customizes orders to your liking. Authentic eats (to the best of my knowledge and experience) hot off the grill and great price points. You can easily walk away with two meals a few sides and mochi dessert for under $25. A definite must-return again and again if I'm back in Ithaca.\n" u'Amazing bubble tea and chicken YakiUdon. This was on our frequent list for eating. The owner is extremely nice and the atmosphere is just cute. Will never forget the great memories that you form here with your friends over Boba!\n' u'waited over one hour last night when i was told only 20 min wait... and the Sukiyaki came with a bowl of rice instead of noodles.. huh??\n' u"Great food and very friendly staff. I was looking for a quick inexpensive  and satisfying meal which this place certainly delivered! My meal even came with free shrimp chips tea and a dessert! What's not to love?\n" u"I'm not sure whether some of these other reviewers have experienced authentic Japanese comfort food but this is by far the best Japanese restaurant in a college town otherwise starved of decent Japanese food. Hoshino-san the owner is a friendly and great guy. He knew me by name and would even often come to my group's concerts. If I came back late from campus I could rely on this place being open until midnight - sometimes they would even keep the kitchen open for me. My club also often did team dinners here and they were very accommodating even offering us free desserts on occasion.\n\nMy favorite item here by far is the yakinikudon (similar to gyuudon but with sukiyaki-style meat) especially when you ask for it extra spicy. The curry is more on the watery side so I'm not a huge fan (I like it nice and thick) but has a great flavor. The tonkatsu and unagidon are other great items to try. The zaru soba is also standout here - refreshing for a hot day if you stay in Ithaca over summer. I found the ramen options to be so-so; great if you're craving ramen since you have no other option in Collegetown but definitely not comparable to the better places in New York let alone Japan.\n\nDesserts and drinks here are also good; their molten chocolate cake and coffee shake were staples of my diet (to my detriment) while I was in college. I wouldn't recommend the bubble tea; go down the street to the Old Teahouse for that.\n\nAgain if you're looking for the typical American Japanese sushi-teriyaki experience don't come here; you have Plum Tree or Miyake for that. If you want authentic home-style Japanese comfort foods this is the place to go. All in all my favorite restaurant in Ctown and I always make sure to stop by every time I visit!\n" u'Love this place definitely the most underrated restaurant in college town. Very competitive prices for the area and service and atmosphere are both 10/10. The food itself is 8/10 but way better than the Korean and Chinese restaurants and tastes pretty healthy. Also they gave me free cake with my oyaku don :)\n' u"There's really a dearth of Japanese food in Ithaca but thankfully Cafe Pacific holds its own.\n\nCafe Pacific is a sort of random little Japanese cafe in Collegetown that doesn't appear to get much foot traffic.  It's definitely on the older side - the computer in there looks ancient - but the place is clean and generally neat.  It's packed to the gills with authentic Japanese candy and food which is awesome.\n\nThe bubble tea here isn't the best in Ithaca but it's pretty darn good.\n" u'Four stars for service and food but taking off a star because of the milk tea quality.\n\nThe milk tea is basically the same as what you can get at The Old Teahouse. It\'s marginally more expensive here. They\'ll make your drink a bit faster here though. But diluted $4.00 slowly made drinks don\'t do too well in my book.\n\nAs for the food I got sukiyaki for lunch today. Flavorful broth plenty of meat and a good amount of vegetables and tofu but it definitely needed more noodles. The guy working here brought my order out pretty quickly and seemed to do so for the other tables as well. He also was pretty nice and patient with me when I was trying to figure out what to order. The place has lots of options for simpler Japanese foods the kind of stuff I usually see on "starving student" menus back home.\n\nIt\'s worth coming back to but I think I\'ll go for a cheaper entree next time.\n' u"Their chicken and spinach soba was pretty much tasteless and the chicken was too tough. I got their vanilla malt shake too which was so-so BUT the owner is SUCH. A. NICE. LADY. We talked for quite some time and she was really friendly and genuinely interested in her customers. I was debating between the vanilla malt or green tea shake and decided on the vanilla malt but after I was done eating she brought me a scoop of green tea ice cream which I thought was really sweet of her. I had never tipped any restaurant more than 20% before but I gave about 40% this time just because she really made me feel like home. Would've given this 2 stars if it was just for the food but the service bumped it to 3.\n" u"So set the scene.  It was about 4 degrees outside 4 or 5 inches of snow on the ground and continuing to snow.  A friend of mine and I take a break from a project and walk down for soup.  I'm not lying when I say their udon and soba got me through some of the worst winter days up here and I've enjoyed their food for years.  \n\nWe order and sit down to wait for the food to come.  The woman manning the counter (I think she might be one of the owners) comes over and offers us hot tea and seaweed snacks both of which we didn't ask for.  The food came out and it was as delicious as ever (especially after the snow and cold outside).  As we get up to leave counter woman stops us offers us dessert and thanks us for coming by in spite of the snow.  \n\nThat's just the sort of place Cafe Pacific is. It may not look like much but it is delicious authentic Japanese comfort food staffed by people who really care about the restaurant and their customers.  I wouldn't expect the treatment I received (this was certainly an aberration and a pleasant surprise) but certainly expect to be pleasantly surprised.\n" u"Good Japanese food doesn't exist in Ithaca so perhaps this one is the best by default. I like the Japanese noodle soup items. The broth is always flavorful and while the noodles don't seem homemade they're good enough. I also have enjoyed their eel rice bowl. Basically the flavors are just as good as the other underwhelming Japanese places but at least you won't pay an arm and a leg for it here.\n\nAs for the deserts avoid the boba drinks at all costs; go down the block to the old teahouse because this place has awful tapioca.\n" u"The sukiyaki and nabeyaki udon are pretty good and so are the molten chocolate and lava chocolate cakes.\nThe best part about Cafe Pacific is the people who work there! Fumi-san is always very cheerful and nice to the customers and brings hot tea to the tables!\nDon't forget to get a punchcard for free food!!\n" u'The place is very affordable and the service is excellent :) they did raise the prices of food in the past year or so but still cheaper than most other restaurants in collegetown. The desserts are also largely good here.\n' u'This tiny Japanese cafe is great for a great tasty bite of Japanese food. The service is great and the owner and cook is very friendly and personable.\n' u'Very subpar boba compared to Kung Fu and the Old Teahouse. Odd space feels like the ceiling is on the verge of collapsing.\n' u"I've only been here for their a amazing bubble tea but the customer service is impeccable. The owner is extremely nice and the atmosphere is cute. I had a great experience overall.\n" u"My rating is kind of a net total of a rating for the different things offered. Here's the breakdown...\n\nThe food (2): I have some friends who are really into it but I just never found the food all that great. Maybe it's because I'm a vegetarian but there aren't many options and it tends to be a bit overpriced for small portions of very simple food. \n\nThe desserts (5): I LOVE the deserts here! Such a great selection and always really great. The lava cake is particularly good!\n\nThe bubble tea (3): Not bad but not all that good. Why get it here if Tea House is right around the corner?\n\nAlso the service is always great - the owners are super nice and so are their employees!\n"]
43.Viva Taqueria,[u"Everyone who goes to school in Ithaca or even is just visiting the town should go to Viva! It's inexpensive and the portions are big enough to get full! I have gone to Viva many times and always enjoy it and the servers are always so nice!\n" u'The evening before my fianc\xe9 and I popped into the bar for margaritas and after smelling the delicious smells wafting from the kitchen we returned the next evening for dinner. \n\nThe drinks are good and well priced. You can get any variety of margarita your looking for for a decent price. \n\nThe food leaves something to be desired. I ordered chicken fajitas and there was only 5 strips of small chicken on the plate. The flavor was nothing special and overall a disappointment. My fianc\xe9 had the carnitas platter with beef which also had a tiny scoop of beef on it and the platter was mainly lettuce and rice. \n\nYou could convince me to go for drinks here but unless your really drunk on tequila you should skip eating here.\n' u"A solid 3/5. \n\nI went here with a friend because he was so confident I would like it. I got a chicken mole super burrito. He got a chicken super burrito. Both burritos came to about $10 but they give you a nice sized burrito. It looks about the size of a foam weenie and it tastes pretty good. But it isn't wow. \n\nOne thing I wish is that it included some chips or something with it. The free water cups are nice despite the water tasting warm but the burrito needs more with it to make it a better value.\n" u'Fun low key Mexican ("Mexithican") place in a convenient location in Ithaca. Always solid food and interesting vegan options and things with tofu although I found the tofu quesadilla to be sort of bland until I doused it in hot sauce. Their mole sauce is excellent so I recommend asking for a side of that too. Massive portions and reasonably priced. Service totally fine. Big restaurant so good for large parties.\n' u'I have been going to viva since I was a kid and it was only the taqueria. It still tastes the same as it did when I was a kid! This is my top 5 favorites all time. I love the beef tacos super burritos and nachos. Margaritas are also great! Excellent one-of-a-kind Mexican food.\n' u'For a Mexican restaurant in Ithaca - your choices are so limited that this place is the best of the two. Decent pricing beers are cheap on draft and quick response.\n' u"Portion sizes are fairly big were you will not go home hungry.  Haven't had a bad meal here yet.  Carnitas dont have much flavor but the burritos and tacos are great.  The pickled vegetables are very good to.  The margaritas they dont skimp out on the alcohol.   One will take the edge off and one more will have you buzzed.  They put a lot of alcohol in them.  Atmosphere is great.  Every time I come to Ithaca its a nice place to sit down and know ill get some quality Mexican food.\n" u"Viva Taqueria offers good Mexican faire that doesn't leave you overly full and guilty afterward. I stopped in recently for dinner with a coworker when we were in town for meetings. It was decently priced and we had a great meal.\n\nThe service was solid and everyone else- busy for a Wednesday evening- seemed to be having fun. I was happy to see good Mexican beer (Negra Modelo) on the menu and ordered one to go along with my vegetarian enchiladas. The sides were enjoyable especially the pickled vegetables. Pickled vegetables- or decent vegetables at all- are foreign for the Mexican spots where I'm from in Buffalo NY. \n\nThe reason I suggested stopping in for dinner was because on my recent trips to Ithaca this spot was packed every time. Moreover everyone looked like they were having a blast. This restaurant is worth a try!\n" u'Rush rush rush. This assembly line operation won\'t let you take a table even if just one member of your party is missing. Then it\'s "hurry-up and decide what you want". Once done if you don\'t want dessert the bill is in and processed in a jiffy. That wouldn\'t be a bad thing if not for the pressure that the waiters start putting on you to hurry up and leave. After a few minutes a manager-type came by to say "I hate to do this to you..." and you can imagine the rest. \n\nNow if the food was any good I may not be as displeased. But the guacamole is slimy/watery and the salsa is mediocre. The dishes are far from good Tex-Mex.\n' u'I think this place is just the cat\'s sombrero. It is always lively they have the lovely option of sit down service bar service or service yourself. There\'s outdoor seating with the option of service or not. \n\nThe food was surprisingly really varied. I ordered 5 different tacos and each one had a different degree of heat and unique flavor. The "spring roll" tofu had a lot of acidity. The pork was flavorful the black bean spicy with the poblano the chicken and beef tender and delicious.\n' u'Really love this place  bartenders are very talented food is good and the service is friendly\n' u"This was the busiest place near the commons and I made it a mission to try this place out before our vacation ended. We had to wait 20 mins to sit down but it was worth the wait. \nWe started off with the chips and salsa. All three salsas were fantastic. The we ordered the 3 taco sampler and the shredded pork burrito . The pork was crazy good . But one of the tacos did not taste good at all we're don't eat Mexican a lot so take it with a grain of salt . All of the sides were great. The beans  rice and slaw were all fantastic. I ordered the casabeche on the advice of a local business owner and it was great. The food was spicy but luckily we had delicious cold drinks to cool off. The smokey joint which I was told used to be a secret drink was very good.  \nMy husband and I still keep thinking about this meal a week later. it was that good.\n" u'There is no one who can tell me with a straight face that this place is true Mexican food or even unapologetically Southwestern. This is "Mexican" food aimed a vegan/vegetarian crowd. Sure it\'s a taqueria by virtue of selling tacos but so what? I visited a couple of times but was never impressed; this place had the level of authenticity I have often seen at restaurants where White people try and sell me their version of Indian food. If you want meatless options that pretend to be Mexican this is the place for you.\n' u'This is my go-to for super nachos. Very inexpensive and fresh ingredients. I also like that they are vegan friendly.\n' u'I would eat here every single day if I could get away with it. There is not a single meal that upon its nearing I do not consider "Viva?"\n\nThe staff is always amazingly friendly and helpful the margaritas are yummy and strong the food is always fresh and delicious. Consistently my favorite drinking and dining experience in Ithaca.\n\nThe only thing I would change is requesting more garlic in the escebeche. Because it\'s flipping delightful.\n\nGreat now I\'m hungry again.\n' u'Mostly great. Mole sauce yeah! Chips and good fresh salsa. Tacos enchiladas all good weakness on the tamales which is one of my favorites.\n' u"This place obviously isn't run by hispanics because the food taste absolutely awful. The rice taste like it came out of a box of rice a roni. The fajitas with drenched in grease and had little flavor. Taco Bell has better tasting food!\n" u"I'm sad to say it happened a bad experience at Viva! It wasn't so much the fact that we were waiting for over 40 minutes just for our drink...but that the staff was totally uninterested in our feedback on how the situation might have been handled better. In fact while we were discussing with our waitress another staffer loudly commented on how unreasonable we were.\n\nAs a frequent visitor - I promise you - our remarks were meant to help. Of course we will be back you can't find better food and atmosphere for the price - but it was disappointing and we have stayed away for several weeks.\n\nI added this review as an update to a previously glowing one and I hope that Yelp will show both.\n" u'Recently enjoyed a visit to Viva with friends.  Shared the Queso Fundido with the others and ordered the Chicken Mole Burrito; had a nice cold bottle of Modelo Especial with it all.  The food is not "perfect-authentic" Mexican (there are a few reviewers here that seem to have a serious problem with this; I guess they are experts in Mexican cuisine or something).  However the food here is really tasty fresh very attractive on the plate and is clearly south-of-the-border in style. The burritos and quesadillas are pretty large and so it seems the price-value of the menu is pretty good.  The restaurant has a very nice Cal-Mex vibe to it.  My friends said that their margaritas were some of the best they\'ve had. The waitstaff understands the menu well and are very attentive.  And one thing for sure...this place gets BUSY! I can\'t wait for my next visit!\n' u'The ingredients are very fresh!  Shredded beef was delicious.  Goat Margaritas were great!  Fast service yummy chips and fresh salsa.  Highly recommend.  I live in San Francisco with lots of taquerias and Viva Taqueria in Ithaca has many beat.\n']
76.DiBella‚Äôs Subs,[u'Nice place! Two vegetarian sub options available plus salads. Bread was fantastic(!) - reminiscent of a NYC/NJ deli. Best hoagie I\'ve had in the area. \n\nInterior is "old fashioned" - comfy booths at metal tables stamped metal ceiling black and white photos on the walls 30\'s big band playing on the radio. \n\nStaff was friendly & helpful. Potato chips are Miss Vickies! Prices for a meal (hoagie + chips + drink) are comparable to Subway but much better tasting! \n\nWill definitely return.\n' u"Absolutely fantastic. I was back in Ithaca for a hockey game and I've been known to travel far distances for DiBella's when craving it (during the summer of '16 I traveled 90 minutes from MA to CT just to get my fix!) so when I was in town a few days after DiBella's opened how could I NOT try Ithaca's newest (and best) sub location?\n\nThe thing that I was most impressed with was efficiency and kindness. Rochester knows how to do subs and the people they trained in Ithaca are no different. There was a decent line on the Saturday afternoon that I was there (they opened officially on Thursday so still in the early opening days) but the line moved super quickly and everyone knew exactly what was going on. When I ordered a sub by name I didn't have to repeat what meat was in it I only said what type of bread cheese etc. once. Definitely on top of their stuff.\n\nAND unlike *my* DiBella's on East Ave they have COKE ZERO!  Talk about exciting.\n\nMy only knock down from 5 stars was that the bread while great was not quite up to the quality I expect from DiBella's. I'm not sure if that's because they overbaked the amount they'd need in the morning or what but the bread was just a little tougher than I was used to. I go back and forth from dining in at DiBella's and having DiBella's 4-5 hours after my boyf picks it up for me. Unfortunately both rolls were just a little tougher than we were used to.\n\nWe got the DiBella's Philly and the Uncle Louie on plain and multigrain respectively so we did try different types of bread and noticed it was the same with both.\n\nEven with that I would not hesitate to go back with regularity. The vibe was great (nice and busy too!) the people were awesome and food was solid.\n" u'They have really gotten their act together. Every week when I go they actually have been getting better and better in terms of service and quality of food. The amount is great for the price.\n']
135.Napoli Pizzeria,[u"Classic upstate NY pizza. Best I've found in Ithaca. Friendly staff and pickup orders are always on time.\n" u"I live nearby and have ordered here few times. Their pizza is not bad but not great either. It's somewhere in the middle. I ordered a take-out pie 45 minutes ahead of time and they were still late. Also i ordered a cheese slice but received a pepperoni. Not sure why. I also think it's kind of pricy at over $20 for a large cheese pie.\n" u"I grew up on Napoli's; I have loved this pizza forever it is the standard on which I judge other pizzas. I was very concerned back in the day (way back) when the Leo sold the place to another individual I thought the quality would decline and so forth but it didn't it was still the same delicious-ness that it always was... however...\nI believe there are new owners the pizza is still okay but I would bet all the money I had that they changed the sauce - and that's what I have loved the most - so I will move on to another and my lifetime love affair with Napoli's ends with this visit. Still good just not what I grew up on... oh well...\n" u"Great pizza...horrible management.  My order took an hour and half plus it was promised at 45-60.  When I called to cancel the order the manager screamed at me to never ever order with them again...no problem.  Sorry you can't hold my dinner hostage and then get mad at me.\n" u"Their sheet specialty pizza's are something else!   Napoli Pizzeria is a real novelty run by hard working and nice people.  Their Napoletano pizza is the best 'everything' pizza I have had.  Boy do I miss it! \n\nNot only do the staff serve great food but they are very courteous.  Once they even gave me a free drink when my order was slightly delayed.  Kudos!\n" u'Where to begin? The very question I proposed after we got home and opened our cheese with feta shrooms and spinach from Napoli Pizzeria!\n\nI placed my order by phone and my pie was waiting for me 20 - 25 minutes after my call. When we entered the establishment the female who was standing by the closed entrance moved closer to one of their counters to greet us with a smile on her face and to ask if we were going to dine-in or place an order to go (which I now know to just come in and do next time since they\'re clearly faster than the time they estimate for pick-ups....at least on slower days).\n\nBefore diving into our 16" I was almost amazed by how our order looked compared to the pics here. I\'ve had pizza with too much feta. And even though I don\'t complain I get that little voice going "this is too salty." Not with Napoli\'s. There\'s just enough to complement the mozzarella underneath so they can mix the right way in your mouth with the green-flecked tomato sauce. And because of the veggies we chose I HAVE to mention the look of our pizza\'s surface; it wasn\'t soggy-looking from the water that is often released when cooking with fresh spinach or mushrooms. But they weren\'t overcooked either; the greens were dark but bright (like when you steam them for 10 or 12 minutes) and the mushrooms were still plump to the bite.\n\nI definitely need to start toggling between these guys and Pizza Aroma. I was a little bummed that Aroma wasn\'t opened today but after my first taste of Napoli\'s I felt kinda lame for waiting so long to give \'em a try.\n' u"I have to say I was a little thrown off by the fact that this pizzeria is at the bottom floor of some office building. I've come to associate a good NY slice with hole-in-the-walls  located in dense urban settings so yes I was pleasantly surprised that the pizza here was very comparable to what I have come to expect in the City. The crust was thin AND chewy which is a combination I have a real hard time finding in the pizzeria on the west coast. \n\nTo top it off the service was outstanding. Though orders are taken and paid for  at the register it seems they deliver orders to your table as common practice.\n" u"Why all the good reviews about this pizza??? \n\nI ordered a 12 inch pizza with extra cheese pepperoni and basil.  The base of the pizza was hard and difficult to chew.  Also I don't think they added extra cheese because it could have been a lot cheesier.  \n\nI ordered the garlic knots as well.  Nothing special about them either.  The marinara sauce it came with was greasy and bland. \n\nThis place definitely does not carry the best pizza in Ithaca.  I won't be returning.\n" u'I ordered a plain pizza and the garlic chicken parmesan. The pizza was fine - the closest thing to NY pizza you\'ll get in Ithaca. But why was a 12" pizza over $12? This is the usual price I\'ve seen for a regular 16" pizza. We\'re not in NYC - oddly overpriced for the location. \n\nAs for the chicken it had a lot of potential. The flavors were robust but way too salty. Additionally the chicken was very dry and the breading came off very easily. If I wasn\'t hungry or had something else to eat I probably would not have finished the chicken once I tried it. Cook the chicken in such a way that it does not feel like sand in my mouth maybe reduce some of that salt and I may try it again. This dish was also weirdly overpriced. An entree that is normally around $13 was $17 at Napoli. \n\nOverall food was OK - not totally inedible but definitely not worth the price nor the drive down to pick it up.\n' u"I'm surprised by the low rating for this pizzeria. \n\nI enjoyed my order here so much! Being vegan I eat pizza with no cheese unless they have vegan cheese and I wanted to try their pizza because someone recommended it to me. So I ordered a slice without cheese and they made a new pie to just cut out a slice for me! Customer service gets even better. They serve it to you at your seat! Give you the napkins utensils plates and ask if you want to drink anything. It was a restaurant style pizzeria but you order at the front.  \n\nThe pizza was amazing. Their sauce had the best mix of spices. I couldn't figure out the ingredients! I was surprised by their crust too - thin and crunchy. How perfect. I also ordered the garlic knots and it had a light crunch on the outside and soft with a light chew on the inside. Enjoyable. I prefer it to be in the oven a little bit longer but not bad. It came with a good amount of sauce too. Some pizzerias are cheap on the sauce but they weren't.\n" u'In the never-ending quest for good pizza in Ithaca we stopped at Napoli for pizza and wings. The location was hidden in the basement of an apartment/office building with very limited parking. It  felt more "Carry out" than "eat in".\nWe took advantage of the large pizza and 10 wings special and ordered two sodas as well. The wings arrived first and were breaded and not particularly great and to top it off bleu cheese was $1+ extra and they didn\'t have celery. \n\nYes the pizza did have a thin crust and was edible better than several places in town. Other than that it was unremarkable. \n\nFor the price ($30 plus tip) I\'d go elsewhere.\n' u'Delivery order - wings white garlic pizza with meatballs and onions.  Fast delivery.  I asked for plates flatware and napkins - they provided plenty.  The wings were amazing!  Plenty of Blue Cheese dressing was provided as well.  The pizza is brooklyn level.  Thank you!\n' u'I grew up in Ithaca and would always stop by here with my dad for pizza. Just stopped by recently after visiting Ithaca college and it brought back great memories. The price was decent food was delicious but most importantly the staff was so incredibly nice. We were waited on like a restaurant and our drinks were even refilled for us. Highly recommend this place\n' u'After waiting an hour and a half for a slice of pizza and 10 wings. The pizza was cold and like cardboard. Wings room temperature. I paid for extra blue cheese and did not get any. The said they could not refund the money. And said they would deliver it. It has been another hour nothing. They used to have the best wings in Ithaca.\n' u"Really bad delivery service bad pizza average wings.\n\nI live within a mile of this place and it took nearly an hour and a half to deliver a small cheese pizza and wings. They charged extra for blue cheese and forgot to include it! And they didn't answer their phones when I tried to report this to them.\n\nTheir food isn't very good anyway. Don't bother with this place.\n" u"Solid thin crust pizza (maybe the best in Ithaca). Its better than Sammy's or Ameritalia it would be worth a 4th star if it weren't for their wings (not so good).\n" u"Pizza is a very good thin crust NY Neapolitan style.  Italian food is good. Don't order the fish sandwich.  I think they don't sell enough of them to keep them from getting old in the freezer.  I've never seen it very busy so it's quieter and less crowded than most places in ithaca.\n" u"The pizza here is a step above mediocre. Although it's probably one of the better ones in Ithaca. \nI always order delivery so this will be heavily biased in the delivery aspect. On a few deliveries they've forgotten items of my orders. In my most recent one I had to cancel the order because after an hour of ten minutes my pizza was not even being made. They said it would still be awhile. There was no indication of this anywhere and not even an apology was offered. \nTo reiterate pizza is good for Ithaca (but mediocre anywhere with decent pizza) and the delivery service is severely lacking.\n" u"I worked for this company when I was young when they were at their previous location about 50 yards away.  To this day I have not found a better slice of pizza or inhaled a better chicken wing.  After being away from Ithaca for about 10 years I went back to find Joan was still working there.  She is a trooper.  If you are passing through or have ever thought about stopping while driving by I would highly recommend doing so.  I dream of this place every now and then and its the first place I visit when I'm home!\n" u'I agree with one of the previous reviewers.  The pizza was thin crust and very solid.  One of the better places in Ithaca for sure.  However the wings...not good at all.  Pretty simple: pizza good wings bad.\n']
21.Waffle Frolic,[u"I did NOT expect this place to be that great. Being in a college town I personally think the prices are too high. The Hangover waffle is $15 even though it includes a lot of meats I don't think it is $15 worth of food. Being that I came on a Saturday morning it was extremely busy and my hanger was having me wondering if it was worth the long wait. \n\nNeedless to say it was worth the wait. The waffles themselves are surprisingly very well made. The butter is added in the waffle so there is no need to add butter on top. The waffle itself is fluffy but not too soft. I can see how this place is so extremely popular in Ithaca and I will definitely be returning if I am in the area!\n" u"Not a great experience here.  The cappuccinos were watery and somehow weak and bitter simultaneously. No amount of cream and sugar were going to make them any better.  \n\nWe tried two waffles.  The Ice Cream Sandwich waffle was top notch... the Carmel Apple waffle not so much. \n\nThe Ice Cream Sandwich waffle is humongous.  Smothered in caramel whipped cream ice cream and chocolate syrup there's a lot there.  It pairs great with the syrup they serve you which we drizzled over the top.  It's photogenic too great to post to social media.  \n\nFor $10 you wonder about the value of the single waffle two scoops of ice cream and mountain of whipped cream you receive.  Still there's enough here to feed two people comfortably.  Get a spoon for when your ice cream melts (the waffle is great when it's a bit soggy with chocolate syrup).  \n\nThe Carmel Apple waffle was tiny.  It has apple butter which I enjoyed but there was just nothing there otherwise.  I was expecting apple slices served on top or apple pie or apple pie filling or apple... something.  I felt I was missing out especially after seeing the mountain of a waffle my companion had ordered. \n\nIt's clear they try hard to make their customer's experience a good one and overall the place gets great reviews-- so my experience may be an exception.\n" u"Wow those waffles looks amazing we should go there! Said by almost everyone who decided to come here based on reviews.  This is personally why I cam here and by word of mouth from friends that insisted I try the food here.  Having been here twice I don't find myself wanting to return on a regular basis.  Overall waffle frolic is okay hence the 3 star rating. \n\nAs many people have stated I honestly believe this place is a bit overpriced for the quality of service and food. (I really hope they pay their employees a living wage).  The waffles look big but they are the thinnest waffles I have had but taste pretty good. Prepare to pay for almost every topping you want and even on coffee refills that's right 1 dollar refills after spending over 30 dollars for two people to eat.  \n\nI haven't had long wait times fortunately but I would steer clear if you're looking for a quick bite to eat during the academic calendar when it is packed.\n" u"Great waffles when they don't burn them! Hence my 4 star rating! Their chicken is so good but you cannot specify what pieces you want so...you're stuck with most white meat. I love ordering from ithaca to go. They definitely make Saturday mornings sweet!!!\n" u"Nothing better than ice cream and waffles! I made my own waffle cause I was feeling for the other creations. This is a good hangout spot especially if you have a large group who wants to relax and play board games. Unfortunately on weekends they close early. Other than the hours I liked the ambiance and the food itself. The quality of the vanilla ice cream is great! I think they sell purity ice cream here but who doesn't sell purity ice cream in Ithaca. The waffle was okay! I wish it was a bit more crunchy for my tasting. Overall I would come back here to hangout with friends and family.\n" u'Fancy? Nope.  Delicious and creative absolutely.  The seating and accommodations are as bare bones as it comes but the star is the waffle and they are legit.  You can have them with a multitude of toppings real maple syrup and a side of bacon etc..  Not cheap not much in the way of comfort or ambience.  You come for the waffles.  Period.\n' u"It was pretty good. I got the Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was very good. I absolutely loved the waffle. It was pretty crispy. I wish I had more to say about how I felt about the chicken and the waffles but I was satisfied!\n\nI didn't love the coffee that was brewed but it does its job. My boyfriend got the affogato. It was amazing! I highly recommend it. It's never too early in the day for ice cream.\n\nI doubt I will get to come to Ithaca for a while but I really want to try a sweet waffle next time.\n" u"What's the first thing I do after getting off a red-eye flight from San Francisco to Ithaca? Get Waffle Frolic of course.\n\nI have quite the soft spot for Waffle Frolic after studying at Cornell and every time I'm back in town for recruiting or any other event I make sure to swing by. This time I had a twin waffle with lemon curd whipped cream and chocolate chips and a cold brew coffee on the side which came out to just about $10.\n\nBoth the lemon curd and whipped cream are homemade and it definitely shows. I had to wait a bit before sinking my teeth into my waffle because my friend had to have her order redone (which they were very accommodating about) and the whipped cream still held it's shape. Regular whipped cream out of a can definitely doesn't do that. The lemon curd was a bit too sweet for my taste but then again I don't have much of a sweet tooth. But that buttermilk waffle was everything I remembered it to be and more. \n\nI'll always be back for you Waffle Frolic.\n" u"We waited for 30-45 mins in line for some good ole chicken & waffles... seems ridiculous to some but when there's perfectly fried chicken involved I'd do anything. Single is $9.50 while the twin is 11.50.\n\nFriends and I all got the twin. In the future I may just stick with the single. I thought the waffles could've been crispier.\n" u"I was skeptical but the waffles were so good.  If you're getting a sweet waffle you may want to hold off on getting syrup.  I had one with Nutella caramel and sea salt ice cream so I didn't end up using the syrup I paid for.  I got the twin size and struggle to finish it.  I might be a one waffle person.  One of my friends got a sandwich - they're very tiny.  If you're hungry you're better off getting something else.  The other got The Hangover.  It looked so delicious and the Maple Hot sauce is delicious.  I'd go back and get a savory waffle.\n" u"It takes some serious balls to open up a waffle shop when there are waffle stations in all of Cornell's dining halls but there's a reason Waffle Frolic is so popular despite the waffle surplus in Ithaca -- they're just so. Damn. Good.\n\nI don't know how they do it but these are the best waffles I have ever had. The toppings are high-quality too. I made the newbie mistake of ordering too many toppings my first go-round and the deliciousness was overwhelming. Nowadays I often order a buttermilk waffle with caramelized bananas and homemade caramel sauce on the side. I'll have to try their blueberry compote next time though! And the savory waffles and the hangover waffles and the buckwheat waffles. The possibilities are endless.\n" u'Great place!\nThey are very busy and may forget a few details of the order but they will fix it quickly. They are very friendly and helpful. Most of all the waffles are great!\n' u"Go for the waffles skip the Purity ice cream. I came here for a scoop of Purity ice cream and coffee. The coffee and latte was delicious. However being a fan of Purity ice cream I think the flavors they had experienced a bit of freezer burn and the scoop I tried was not great. My friend did not enjoy her ice cream either.\n\nEither way the environment is hipster-ish and cute (there is an adjacent room and second floor) the place is so much bigger than it looks like on the outside. However in the future...I'll make sure to go to the original Purity location if I want ice cream (because it IS good) and stick to Waffle Frolic for the waffles and coffee.\n" u'All I can say is the food is the best and worth it! Super cool place with lots of young people and everyone is super polite. They have gluten free food for those that need it and the chicken and waffles is by far the best I have ever had\n' u"Quick solid breakfast. A good option that will keep you full before you head out on a 4 hour hike... If you're into that kinda thing.\n\nThe waffle was super light and you must dip it in their maple syrup. The egg and bacon offer a savory complement to the dish. The small was more than filling for me. They even gave me the over flow batter so I got more like 1.5 waffles. Coffee was decent they'll serve it in a mug too if you eat in. Gluten free waffles too! The man friend was satisfied.\n\nLine was short when we arrived close to 10am. By the time we left it was starting to get busier as the college kids started rolling in. It's an order at the counter kinda place. Be sure to check the specials menu for some extra hearty extra tasty looking meals. I was intrigued by the grilled cheese options too! \n\nSeating area upstairs was spacious. Good for larger groups. Many people pushed tables together up there. They have a bunch of games and books if you feel like hanging for a while.\n" u'Three words. So. Many. Choices. I stopped by here with my Vegan friendly. Now I understand many places in Ithaca are vegan or vegetarian friendly and when you think of a waffle joint beef or chicken (yuck) don\'t come to mind eggs maybe but not beef or chicken. However what sets Waffle Frolic aside from many other Ithaca eateries (who are more so Vegan accommodating) is that Waffle Frolic labels everything that is Vegan or Vegetarian. On top of that they have a vegan ice cream. I mean come on. My vegan friend\'s eye lit up when we walked in. Never mind the forever existing line for a Sunday morning. \n\nThe shop has a simple and straightforward menu. You walk in and you follow the easy steps: pick a waffle (gf/vegan options available) pick a size (single or twin) and then pick your toppings. Indecisive? No prob. They have tons of pre-"arranged" waffle meals including chicken with waffle (next on my list to try) waffle with two eggs and bacon (yum) grilled cheese turkey chili with a cornbread waffle and they always have some specials. The day I went they had a hangover waffle (with everything but the kitchen sink) and a florentine waffle. \n\nWe went during brunch hour so the line was long but it is so worth it. Once you order head upstairs to grab a seat. It is definitely first come first serve and if you get there at the wrong time you might just need to grab a seat outside on one of the benches in the Commons. I settled on a single eggs and bacon (it\'s brunch after all) and then a single buttermilk waffle with Nutella and fruit of the day (strawberry). My friend got the twin with vegan ice cream. We were stuffed. \n\nI also want to mention they have drinks available. We each went for heir chai latte. They even have drink substitutes for their drinks. The only thing hey did not have that I feel could have been made was vegan whipped cream but no biggie at all.\n\nI would say the waffle was very light fluffy on the inside crispy to the bite. My savory waffle worked really nicely--I was concerned they wouldn\'t time the temperature of all the components right but it was perfect. The eggs were cooked over easy and my bacon crispy but not burt. As a waffle iron owner I was definitely impressed with the flavor packed meal. My classic Nutella and strawberry waffle also did not disappoint.  My vegan friend and I spent much of the first 15 minutes eating. Our lattes were delicious.\n\nFinally I would say they have a loud speaker installed so they can call your name and you can come down to pick up the food by the front counter on the first floor. When we went the loud speaker was broken so they just shouted your name and you could hear just fine. The place does get packed--I hope they can expand into a bigger store front soon with some waiting service. It definitely has the potential. A great stop for sure!\n' u"Great waffles good combinations of flavors! Sometimes feel a little shortchanged by the amount of toppings on the big waffles for the price... It's still a lot of waffle not a lot of chicken for example. Still a fan. I'll return happily!\n" u"First the wait was so long but it was almost worth it on a non-busy day. I wish they would let us know beforehand that vegan options would take particularly long to make.\n\nGet ANYTHING with Nutella. I don't know how these guys do it but their Nutella is ridiculously thick and delicious. Got the Buttermilk Waffle with Nutella Strawberry and Bananas which is usually a hit or miss for me depending on the strawberries but these were all so perfectly sweet. A single serving was just the right portion for me and price was decent for a waffle specialty place.\n" u'Love their waffles here - when I came back for Slope Day I had breakfast here for 3 days and I was here for 4 days. I recommend trying the buckwheat waffles it really adds a lot of flavor to the waffle regardless of what you put on it. The savory waffles are actually pretty good if you get eggs they come in runny and pairs really well with the waffles.\n\nThe sweet waffles are amazing too - I usually get something with green tea ice cream. I really appreciate their customization - for example I changed the ice cream in the Lemon Drop from vanilla to green tea for no extra cost. Changing buttermilk to one of the other options only cost an extra quarter.\n' u'The best waffle/breakfast place. Their waffles are so delicious. A ton of available toppings and preselected waffle configurations. Do not miss this place! Vegan options too!\n']
41.John Thomas Steakhouse,[u"John Thomas Steakhouse is easily one of the nicest (and most expensive) restaurants in Ithaca but it is definitely worth the dent it will put in your pocket. We started with the smoked mozzarella and tomato salad with balsamic and it was very good. My best friend and I shared the small porterhouse steak (cooked to a perfect medium rare) and it was more than enough food for us. The sides we shared were the fries/fried onions mashed potatoes (THE BEST SIDE) green beans almondine (the vegetable special) and mushroom caps (very close second to the mashed potatoes). The only critique I have of any of the food is that the steak and fries were just CRYING out for salt. It's so important to liberally salt your steak so it gets that great tasty crust on the outside when you sear it and it was just missing a touch of salt. The same goes for the fries. But the quality of the steak was absolutely top notch and the fries were perfectly crisp. For dessert we shared the creme br\xfbl\xe9e the cranberry raspberry crumble and the flourless chocolate pate (for our gluten free friend). This is definitely a great place for a special occasion or really fancy date. We had the private room upstairs which is great for a group of about 8-10.\n\nAlso this place was great about allergies. One of our friends is gluten free and allergic to tree nuts and deathly allergic to salmon (which is on the menu). The waitress made sure that her food was clear of all of the possible allergens and even made sure to use new knives for her dessert to ensure no cross contamination. They made ordering really easy and this meal a pleasure for her.\n" u'Absolutely terrible. Everything was overcooked to the point of being inedible and when I went to send it back the waiter had the gall to argue with me about it. At these obnoxious prices the absolute very least I would expect is for the waiter to not cop an attitude when I want to send back the $40 piece of charcoal he just put in front of me.\nDo. Not. Go. Here.\n' u'I will say that the old saying "they don\'t make em like that anymore" fits well here! This is the old school Italian Steakhouse that your parents went to kind of place! The waiters are in the same suspenders and bowties. Desserts are brought out on a cart for guests to select from. Unfortunately we had attended a cocktail event earlier but was still a bit hungry by the time we checked into La Tourelle (hotel) so we went there for a quick bite. \n\nDesiring somethig light we hoped for salads and appetizers. We found the menu overwhelming with delicious options! We ordered the mixed green salad witg blue cheese the smoked trout and a HUGE veal chop to share. However I ended up ordering the German friend potatoes as a side after looking at the waiters face in response to our desires to share our selected item. We really felt like we upset him! \n\nOverall huge huge chop! It lacked seasoning in my opinion but the demi glaze with big mushroom caps was delicious! The German potatoes were well seasoned salad was great and the trout was a bit on the salty side but smoked well. The creme brulee was amazing!\n' u"Because it's one of the nicer places in Ithaca and the only steakhouse in town one can't help but have high expectations. But it's just okay. It doesn't stand out in any particular way for me...it was surprising that they didn't have maldon sea salt to sprinkle on your steak if you wanted it! :(\n\nThe porterhouse steak is nice to share though even the smaller one will fill two up just fine. Their mushroom side is generally good but again nothing spectacular. Same with the brussels sprouts. If you say there's pancetta I must see and taste them!! They did make for rare pleasant surprises though. \n\nLastly the chocolate cake...was okay. There was a lot of potential only because I really love chocolate but it was a stingy slice and the ice cream could have saved it but that was also dinky.\n" u"Used to be good. I have been here 1-2 a year for thebpast 5 years and I feel that they are slowly sliding downhill to obscurity. Luckily I never have had to pay or I'd be pi$$ed. \n\nThe place is old food is average and the service is stuffy and not friendly. It is one of the nicer places in Ithaca so it's understandable why people come here. Also is the only steakhouse so they have a reason to stay complacent. \n\nDon't get me wrong - the food is fine but when you pay their prices you expect superior quality.\n" u"Brie en croute: Delicious!\nRib eye: It was okay asked for medium seemed a bit overcooked and the outside was REALLY charred just like previous reviewers said. The part that wasn't charred was very good. The problem is the majority of the surface was pretty burned and its hard to ignore that crusted dry burnt part. Steak sauce was pretty good kinda sweet\nLobster: 3.5 lbs $90 very big and expensive but very good. \nI would have given 4 stars if it hadn't been burnt but I don't think I've ever been to a single steak restaurant that has burnt the steak as much as this so unless this is some new fad in the steak world I'm out if the loop for...\n" u"Best steak in the area no question about it. \n\nIt doesn't matter what you order - all of their steak cuts are seasoned and grilled to perfection. If I had to make a recommendation I'd go with the ribeye/filet mignon combo. Perfect size for two people when ordered with side dishes. \n\nAnd speaking of sides the mashed potatoes are on POINT! Super flavorful and has a crispy outer layer that gives it phenomenal texture. \n\nThe building used to be a house so the interior is very homey and comforting. Awesome date spot!\n" u"After hearing so many rave reviews we decided to make reservations for Valentine's day here. The service is very good and polite we had no issues with it and were seated very promptly. The atmosphere is very nice very old-school steakhouse feel great lighting for a romantic dinner. \n\nThe reason my review has so few stars is the quality (or lack thereof) of the food. We paid the same price for a meal at Del Posto to eat extremely bland steak (that was very tender granted) with no flavor whatsoever. We ordered the porterhouse for two.\n\nThe sides are a la carte and were very good (the german potatoes are delicious as are the garlic mashed potatoes). We had a crab cake appetizer that was decent but the steak was honestly so disappointing. We should have gone to Texas Roudhouse grill because honestly their steak is that much better than what ours was. For the price I would go literally anywhere else. \n\nIf you seek steak that doesn't encourage you to become a vegetarian due to its complete lack of flavor go elsewhere. It seemed like there was no butter salt or pepper (or any flavoring used) on our steak. It was honestly the worst tasting steak I have ever had and I've never disliked any other steak I've eaten.\n\nI cannot speak to the dessert as we were so disappointed with the steak we went elsewhere for it.\n" u"Very very good.  The salad was a perfect size (not too big or small) and not boring at all.  My son & I shared the porterhouse steak which was grilled perfectly.  Terrific baked potato and the saut\xe9ed spinach were delicious.  To round out the meal we shared a creme br\xfbl\xe9e .  I would recommend this restaurant which is definitely out of the way albeit worth the drive.  If you're from downstate (Brooklyn to be exact) it ain't Peter Luger's or DeStefano's but it's close enough!  I would not purchase their steak sauce but we really enjoyed the meal.  The service is great too!\n" u"In my experience the food here was good but not particularly outstanding. We split a steak and seafood special (for $140). Our lobster tasted a little off. \n\nI would have given this place another star. However we JUST got engaged about 15 minutes before entering the restaurant. We saw a couple we knew there so we obviously told them and our waiters overheard because they congratulated us. I don't know I'm expecting too much but I would have thought they would have given us a complimentary glass of champagne or a free dessert to celebrate the occasion seeing as we spent a lot on dinner. It was just disappointing.\n" u"I have heard so many people RAVE about this place. Yes it is the most expensive restaurant in Ithaca but I would not say it is the best. I have been here twice in the last two weeks (only went the second time for a friend) and was disappointed each time maybe it's because I ordered salmon at a steakhouse but I don't eat meat. I told the waiter specifically tell the chef to not overcook the salmon because last time it was so overcooked I didn't want to eat it. The waiter was unsure because I said I want it medium-rare (which means A LITTLE RARE IN THE MIDDLE) but it comes out overcooked AGAIN. Unbelievable if a chef knows how to cook a steak he should know how to cook a fish.\n" u"This place literally has the best lobster ever. I came here for a formal at Cornell during my visit from Berkeley and I was very very impressed with how fresh the seafood was. I ordered the tuna steak which was also delicious and perfectly cooked on the outside pink on the inside. The calamari was also a great starter and perfectly crisped on the outside but tender on the inside.\n\nOne thing though the service wasn't that great. The woman who was serving us refused to let me taste the wine before we ordered the bottle (standard at any nice restaurant) and she also didn't have the best attitude.\n\nDessert was average I ordered the berry cobbler a la mode and it tasted like it usually does despite the waiter's very positive recommendation. The creme brulee was pretty good it was smooth and creamy and pretty delicious. What I also liked was the fact that they pushed around the options after for us to choose with visuals.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place for the seafood (didn't actually try any red meat) although for a full meal be ready to spend quite a bit of money. It worked out to about $100 a person.\n\nIf I could give 3.5 stars I would but with the service and the dessert it trends more towards a 3 star experience.\n" u"After traveling 5+ hours from NYC to go glamping at Firelight Camps (which is conveniently located on the same grounds) we were excited to hear of a good steak place within a two minute walk of our tent. \n\nUpon arriving not only were we not greeted by the staff we were treated as if we had the plague. For a restaurant to be located on the same grounds as a campsite you would assume we weren't their first 'campers' to stop by for dinner. \n\nWe ordered the porterhouse ($90) with a side of tomato and onion ($15) for three girls. The service was quick however when they brought out the tomato and onion side dish it was literally one raw onion and one unseasoned tomato (sliced). For $15 we would expect this side dish to be more impressive than something I could pick in my garden for under $.50. \n\nThe meat was flavorless bland and dry (like a bad wine) which we also had. \n\nWe had five different waiters all asking us the same questions. Considering there was only two other tables of people - why the excess wait staff for our table? \n\nFurther the entire time we did not feel welcomed and that they were waiting for us to go to our tent to be with our 'people'. \n\n We were paying customers who had the same currency as every other damn diner there. To be treated like second rate customers is a terrible business strategy. \n\nIf it wasn't for the camp grounds you wouldn't be getting 30% of the business you currently get. \n\nPut on a fake smile like you already do serve me good food and you'll get more than one star.\n" u"This place is a MUST for steak lovers in the Ithaca area. Pricey but worth every penny. I am from Long Island and have eaten at great steakhouses including Morton's Bryant & Cooper Prime & the Palm. This place is truly on par with all of those.\n\nMy filet was cooked PERFECTLY and was delicious. The appetizers and sides were truly exceptional. The dessert summed up a perfect meal. This place is a favorite of my family's for every time that they visit. It never ceases to amaze.\n" u"John Thomas represents everything good about the dying breed of old-school  steakhouses.  From the clubhouse decor to the dimly-lit dining room the restaurant evokes memories of a bygone era one in which you may have expected Mr. Thomas himself (who may or may not have been real by the way) to waltz through the wooden doors to join you for some whiskey and good red meat.\n\nFor those of you who may not be familiar with the area this place is literally the gold standard when it comes to the Ithaca dining scene.  As a poor college student I visited the steakhouse a grand total of three times in four years -- once for my birthday once for a friend's birthday and once for graduation.  That's it.  So for a while I wondered whether the legend of the place was clouding my judgment of the food.  Having since become a real working adult I would still venture to say that John Thomas holds its own against Peter Luger Del Frisco's and any other top NYC steakhouse.  It's really that good.\n\nThe must-try item is the porterhouse-for-two which comes with an amazing house sauce (I know that's taboo but trust me there's a reason they show off their sauce).  Their lobsters when available are quite possibly the largest crustaceans I have ever seen in my life.  They are basically mammals.  Sides are ordered a la carte --  I love both the wild mushrooms and the mushroom caps and you should order a combination of the french-fried onions and potatoes.  Throw in some spinach (creamed or sauteed) and you're good to go!  Once you're about to explode after an evening of gluttony a server will showcase a cart/tray of homemade desserts.  It's really hard to go wrong but the cheesecake is superb.\n\nI'd be remiss if I ended my review without talking about poker.  Every guest at John Thomas receives a poker card (although now only Monday - Wednesday).  You can mix and match cards with your companions to form poker hands which are redeemable for a number of different food prizes -- a royal flush for example will net you an entree for two!   I learned the other night that some Cornell students began counterfeiting the cards and selling them for a profit on eBay and Craigslist (which is just truly sad).  Apparently the poker game was halted until about a year ago after which the restaurant decided to continue it (due to some pissed-off regulars) on a limited basis. \n\nSeriously how can you not love this place??\n" u'A party of 10 we were put in a small room upstairs with a faulty air system on a 80 degree day. Waited for 45 minutes from 8:30-9:30 pm for overcooked steaks and dried chicken and cold cooked vegetables. Very expensive and hardly worth it. This was a serious disappointment.\n' u"Service and kitchen excellent.\n\nI came here with my wife as I was looking for a good steakhouse during our vacation. This choice was a good one. \nThe service is decent and experienced. They are friendly attentive and know their job. That's a great plus. \nWe decided to go for the jumbo shrimp cocktail as a starter. Great food quality and the dip was fantastic.\n\nFor the main-course we took the 40 oz porterhouse steak with half and half and spinach. The steak was amazing and cooked medium rare to our order. Great quality. Spinach had a good taste but lacked a little bit of salt for my taste. The onion rings and fries were crispy and good in taste.\n\nAll the time we had the feeling of being the only guest. Water was refilled constantly and we are sure we saw all service staff.\n\nFor desert we took the creme br\xfbl\xe9e and a cup of coffee. The creme was good but the coffee was definitely the best I had in the USA by far. \n\nI can only recommend to come here. It is worth the money!\n" u"This restaurant is in a house set back from a main road on the outskirts of Ithaca with a pond to the side of the property. The tables are spread through the rooms. The hostess greeted us as we walked in and seated us at a quiet table in the front room with views of the pond and the flowers that lined the entrance walkway. You almost feel like you are walking in to a friend's home that is set up for a dinner party.\n\nOur servers were fantastic!! Friendly cheerful and attentive but never overbearing. Once we were seated water was poured and bread was served. For appetizers we ordered lump crabmeat cocktail (a special) and smoked mozzarella & tomato salad. Both were incredible. The crab was fresh - not fishy at all- and mixed with a mildly-flavored remoulade that did not overpower the crab. The fresh tomatoes and smoked cheese were sliced thick (a knife was needed) and topped with a really good balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nThe menu is a la carte- we chose Filet Mignon medallions with a wild mushroom demi-glace rib-eye steak asparagus and German fried potatoes. All were delicious - the mushrooms were sliced thin and not overcooked. The medallions were a perfect medium and tender with just the right amount of demi-glace (which was amazing). The potatoes were awesome- baked potatoes cubed and fried...yum!! We were too full to for dessert but we watched the dessert cart intently whenever it passed our table lol.\n\nPricey? Yes. Worth it? YES. In this case we got what we paid for- a fantastically delicious dinner in a romantic setting with outstanding service. It was a pleasant romantic relaxed and intimate setting - I honestly cannot think of one even slightly negative thing to say. This was one of the best steak dinners I've ever had and I wish we lived closer.\n" u"We waited for an hour and a half for our main course. The server was loud with a voice that was like fingernails on a chalk board. The steaks were ok. The steak fries and fried onions were awful. I've had better French fries at McDonalds. I've had better much better food with way better service for less money at many restaurants. Not impressed. Unfortunately we won't be back. Way over priced. Even the Christmas decorations were tacky.\n" u"Came to check out the restaurant for a work dinner. Very friendly knowledgable staff. I LOVE when servers memorize the specials of the day and don't need to read it off their books. Shows they enjoy their job and took the time to remember things. \nOur server was great! Everything came out in a timely manner and the food was delicious!  I had my doubts....but when my 5lb bone in prime rib came I was thoroughly surprised and pleased with it. Biggest prime rib I've EVER seen!  And it was delicious!  We got saut\xe9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms. Both excellent. And then the dessert cart came rolling through.....the flour less chocolate cake was like a piece of solid fudge. So decadent and delicious!  \nVery surprised and glad that I got to experience such a great dinner there. Can't wait to bring my group there!\n"]
71.Monks On The Commons,[u"Monks On The Commons is found on the bottom floor of Ithaca's Marriot hotel.  It's quite different from anything else Ithaca has to offer at least in the commons area as it's an exceptionally clean quiet and classy cocktail bar that also has a variety of beer and wine options.  There's a very neat ambience here; Monks is well-lighted tidy and somewhat elegant. \n\nPrices here are fairly standard.  They have a bar plenty of tables and booths and \n\nThey fill up at night so you may have a small bit of trouble getting a table for a group if it's after 8:00 or 9:00.\n" u'Overpriced and underwhelming.  The space is quite nice bright and open and reminded us of a brunch spot we went to in Philly recently.  We ordered the Build Your Own Bloody Mary a cup of coffee sweet potato kale hash and crab Louie salad.  \n\nThe coffee beans were roasted too long and the coffee itself was incredibly weak.  Bloody Mary was pretty good and came with a nice selection of things to choose from.  The sweet potato hash was decent but it was basically just that: roasted sweet potato with an egg on top and barely any kale.  I believe they just crumbled a few kale chips and added that in.  Also I think the menu said "eggs" (plural) but there was only one.  The salad was tasty and the dressing was flavorful but there was way too much of it.  I tend to like a lot of dressing/sauce on my salads/sandwiches/food in general but this was excessive.\n\nOverall the food wasn\'t bad but it just didn\'t live up to my expectation - especially for the price.  There\'s a lot of room for improvement though so I hope they continue to do that!\n' u"This bar is a nice addition to downtown Ithaca. It is in the ground floor of the new Marriott Hotel which is kind of fun. It isn't my favorite spot in town but I would definitely go again. \n\nPros:\n - another spot in town to get a nice cocktail!\n - nice service (waiters and bartender were friendly)\n - great decor (it's new and a little nicer than most spots here... but not so fancy that you feel out of place)\n - a good selection of mixed drinks and wines (a few hot drinks too!)\n - decent view (windows along the wall let you look out on the commons)\n\nCons:\n - drinks are decent but I haven't had a showstopper yet (still prefer Argos)\n - small plates for food are just okay (and at the price I haven't gotten main plates)\n" u'Monks On The Commons is a bar/restaurant in the new Marriott Hotel\nTherefore I would like to reference the Marriott Business Conduct : \nContinue the Marriott Tradition of Integrity.\nBe Accurate Honest and Fair.\nAvoid Even the Appearance of Wrongdoing.\nObey the Law.\nUnderstand the Implications of Your Actions.\nBe Trustworthy.\nTreat Others with Dignity and Respect.\nWork for the Good of the Community.\n\nThis experience however was not in the least bit. To preface I recently moved to Ithaca one week ago. I was celebrating my birthday and I was experiencing my first Commons festival (The Chili Cookoff Festival). My friends and I had stopped by the Monk\'s booth to try their chili and they were giving away $15 certificates on their booth table to encourage chili participants to venture to their restaurant location afterwards. After indulging in all of the chili we wanted/needed my friends and I headed to Monk\'s restaurant. We walked right in with no issues. We reviewed the certificate provided "$15 towards featured Rioja Wine" on the drink menu there were 3 options for Rioja wine - 2 blushes and 1 red. We laid out our certificates and asked the bartender if she would please describe the different types of Rioja wines to us. My friend and I had the blush wine for a 9oz carafe for $11 her boyfriend had nothing. We drank our wine and when the bill came we laid our certificates into the check presenter. The manager said "Oh those are only for the red Rioja wines." My friends were disappointed and with an unexpected "oh...." laid their cards into the bill presenter - to pay for my birthday beverage. I had asked if I could speak with the manager. I specifically asked him before he would run the cards if we could discuss the certificate situation. Without a blink of an eye he ran the cards and said "Well you should have asked your server which specific Rioja wine the certificate covered." I said "I\'m sorry but we had our certificates out and we were asking only about the Rioja wines the certificate doesn\'t say specifically the red." His response "I wouldn\'t have bothered to tell you either if you didn\'t criticize her wine descriptions." She was standing next to him at that moment. I apologized "I\'m sorry that we criticized your wine descriptions." Her response was "You didn\'t. I don\'t know why he said that" and walked away. He laid the paid bill down and walked away. \n\nFor a mission statement to state: \nTradition of Integrity.\nBe Accurate Honest and Fair.\nAvoid Even the Appearance of Wrongdoing.\nObey the Law.\nUnderstand the Implications of Your Actions.\nBe Trustworthy.\nTreat Others with Dignity and Respect.\nWork for the Good of the Community.\n\nNone of these were portrayed and in fact left me and my friends insulted and disgusted. We will never visit or recommend this place again. If you received the same $15 certificate please be aware that only the red Rioja wine is included.\n' u"We went here for Saturday brunch. It's very cute inside with not many tables and we were seated immediately. However there was only one waitress for all of the tables. It took a very long time for her to even get our drink orders. The food didn't take too long to come out but the waitress didn't have time to check on us. She ended up forgetting my drink order but I had to flag her down after we were served breakfast. The food was exceptionally bland. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the huevos rancheros. I ended up needing hot sauce just to make the huevos rancheros taste like anything and the chicken and waffles had very small portion sizes. Overall the food was over priced and the staff and atmosphere were not enough to make the experience worth it.\n" u"The only reason why people are saying these things is because they're angry that the Marriott is blocking the view of their precious lake. Seriously go try the food for yourself. I'm reviewing it on my website but it does not deserve two and a half stars. Everyone is incredibly friendly professional and the food is inventive and tastes far better than almost everything else in Ithaca. This place is as good as Mix Maxie's Bandwagon Just A Taste Cent-Dix or any of the other amazing restaurants in Ithaca. I'm including Mercato when I say Cent-Dix because the two restaurants are from the same people.\n" u"I'm not sure what is going to happen with this place. Its fare is too expensive and not special to justify regular community attendance. An $18 burger that pales even to Ale house? Come on. Even the bread they give you feels like it was bought from a grocery store a few days ago. Didn't try the drinks but someone else in my party liked them.\n" u'Had a great date night here last night.  Honestly the food is a 3 but service brought up this rating.  First impressions matter!  Caprice who greeted us warmly introduced us to the restaurant and brought us to our table was wonderful.  I instantly felt transported out of the Ithaca restaurant scene and truly felt like I was in a nice upscale restaurant in a big city.  Thank you Caprice!\n\nSo I need to say this next - the prices are a tad outrageous for Ithaca.  4 drinks a $5 appetizer special biscuits 2 entrees and 2 desserts came out to $140 before tip.  Hmmmm.  Don\'t get me wrong - that\'s a lot of a food and we both had leftovers but this seemed steep. That\'s even more expensive than Mercato which I think is the priciest and best restaurant on the Commons.\n\nOkay so before I dig in here bear in mind that they have not been open long and I am sure are still working out the kinks.\n\nFood Problems:  I was so excited for a nice southern biscuit that I bit the bullet and bought the $7 sweet potato biscuits.  They were extremely dense dry and flavorless unless you had a ton of the honey butter on them.  Some pieces of the short ribs were dried out but some pieces were fine.  The sauce on the parppardelle was weirdly sweet.  Lastly and Big Problem here the desserts were honestly just awful.  "Creme brulee" was not even close to creme brulee.  Sure there was a custard (the "creme") but no brulee.  Just fruit on top of a small amount of custard for $9.  I guess I\'d call this a parfait or something?  Name failure aside it was still just okay.  Our other dessert Milk & Cookies was aptly named but just plain not good (basically a large hard loaded cookie with a side of cream).\n\nOtherwise food was good.  We liked our shisito pepper appetizer we liked the bread service with the F. Oliver\'s oil & spice mix (nice touch) I liked my Soul Plate which was the certainly the best value of the night - $24 for mac & cheese fried chicken (great) fried trout cornbread (meh) and collard greens (really good even though I don\'t usually care for them).  Note: 2 people could easily share the Soul Plate or a group could probably share this as a smorgasbord app.  And we liked our drinks which were quite tasty (though not strong).\n\nOverall great service by the host and by our server Gina nice decor/atmosphere a fun date night for sure - but I\'m not going all-out here again until the food is more consistently good (and I\'ll probably never get dessert here again - what\'s the point when Madelines is right next door).\n' u'I went here for the first time with friends because the other downtown places were packed. We arrived around 5:15 and were able to quickly get a table for a party of 6 which was great. The place has nice decor and atmosphere with a decent drink menu. The waitress was friendly but didn\'t know much about the drinks available and I don\'t mean annoying detail questions but what the alcohol was in their special cocktail of the night. The place where they lose all their points for me is their prices which are out of control. When I\'m ordering grouper tacos where you get a total of 5 appetizer sized tacos for $18 and my husband ordered a "monks burger" which is really just a bacon cheese burger with their matchstick potatoes  (think matchstick shaped potatoes chips with rosemary salt on them) for another $18 I expect magic and received just average for the area. Don\'t get me wrong it wasn\'t bad and had the prices been more in line with the area probably about $12 for each of those items I probably would have been happy with it. They have some opportunity here but need to address their prices.\n' u"I hate leaving such a negative review as the first comment but it can't be helped. My husband and I wanted some place nice for our anniversary and we liked the menu options of Monks so we decided to give it a try. Our first sign that something wasn't quite right came in the form of our waitress who obviously didn't know what was going on. She didn't know what items were included with one of the options on the menu and only remembered to tell us what items were sold out when we went to order one of them. It happens we're all new at one time or another so we laughed it off and enjoyed our small serving of bread. \n\nWe'd ordered apps and entrees and our second sign that something might be wrong was when two tables that were seated after us got their apps before us. About a half hour went by when we were approached by a second waiter who said he would be taking over our table. That's when I saw our original waitress leaving. Before we have a chance to speculate what was going on our appetizers were finally brought out. Yay! Except that less than 5 minutes later before we'd even finished our entrees were brought out too. \n\nI had the fish which wasn't bad but it was smothered in sauce when I'd asked them to go light on it. To add insult to injury the sauce was a tad oily and really brought down what was otherwise an okay meal. We also got the scallops which were another story. They were over cooked gritty and had the feet still left on them. Also we got the blue crab deviled eggs and there wasn't any crab to be seen. \n\nSince it was our anniversary I figured that we might as well get dessert since that's the hardest course to screw up. We decided to split the berry creme brulee. On the very first bite one thing was obvious...it wasn't even a creme brulee! They'd made a panna cotta and called it creme brulee. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DESSERT THEY'RE SERVING. I mean...come on. It wasn't bad once we stopped wondering why the creme brulee was so gritty but it also wasn't what we wanted. \n\nWe finally got the bill for the sub par meal and the total came to over $70--and we didn't even order alcohol! Outrageous price for a sub-par meal.\n" u'Service was great ambience was pleasant food was hit or miss.  The featured appetizers from 5.30-6.30 p.m. for $5 is a good deal and we loved the Southern mac and cheese. The bread pieces served at the beginning were cold and could use a dip. The roasted tomato and pepper soup and the crispy brussel sprouts were delicious but the charred cauliflower and broccoli was a disappointment (felt uncooked).  All in all though a good experience we are planning to go back to try the breakfast menu.\n' u'Was hoping for good dining because I liked Luna when they first opened. The large dishes on other people\'s tables looked good but we tried several of the small dishes to share. Prices are pretty high $18 for a burger so expectations are also high. Brussel sprouts were okay they should be since they\'re on quite a few of the dishes. Scallops were eh one was bitter one was good one was inedibly salty and the brussel sprout salad that came with it---I\'ve never had raw shaved brussel sprouts before but if you do serve it just google how to properly prep a brussel sprout. They still had the stems on them! on a RAW brussel sprout! To add to a weird experience the service was just odd. A couple next to us was chatting away with their menus for like 30 minutes and they had to ask to have their order taken. Then dishes came out and they didn\'t know which tables they were going to. "did you order this?" is not something they should be asking when there are only 10 tables in the entire restaurant. Waitstaff walked around looking at the floor and not towards anyone who was trying to get their attention. Sorry won\'t be coming back for a long time.\n' u'Outrageous prices. Bad food. I was so excited to try a new place in town. The cocktails were only OK. The food awful. We ordered the sweet potato bread puff things. They were dry and completely tasteless. The atmosphere is wonderful But I will not be spending that kind of cash to give them a second chance.\n']
9.Carriage House Cafe,[u'Food: 5 stars!\nService: 5 stars!\nAtmosphere: 5 stars!\nPrice point: A little pricey so 4 stars.\n\nHighly recommend!\n' u'Very friendly staff. food was excellent! Would recommend the chicken artichoke and the carriage house burger. \n\nWaiter even gave us free road coffee. That might have nudged me just enough to write my first review.\n' u"I cannot comprehend why this is such a highly-rated place for brunch. Long waits. Crowded. Small mimosas. Overpriced average food. No variety.\n\nNot worth the wait or the money. Just learn to cook yourself a nice brunch at home and you'll have a more enjoyable experience.\n" u"Carriage House is an Ithaca staple and it's definitely some of the best quality food on Cornell's campus. We arrived on a Sunday right when it opened (9 am) and there was a line stretching long out the restaurant. When we got to the front they told us there was going to be a 30-40 minute wait but they told us we could wait upstairs where we could order coffee and other brunch drinks.\n\nWe went up and the upstairs (which I had never seen before) was adorable and awesome. We got a few coffees - AMAZING COFFEE and free refills. I got a bloody mary which had too much Tabasco and not enough vodka but it was much needed after a rowdy night. \n\nOur server Sage was lovely and really helpful. We ordered the brie-stuffed french toast the pancake special and I got the breakfast sandwich eggs over-easy with home fries on the side. \n\nI had the chance to steal a bite of my fiancee's french toast which was INCREDIBLE but I'm not a big fan of sweet brunch food so I wouldn't personally order it. My breakfast sandwich which I've had before is absolutely incredible - every element from the bread to the very sharp cheese is absolutely perfect. Yolks were perfectly runny just how I like them. \n\nHome fries which I've also had before were really the only disappointment. It was a pretty small portion and at over $4 not exactly a bargain - especially considering how cheap they are to make. Not personally a fan of the house ketchup either call me provincial but I'd rather have Heinz. \n\nOverall though I would absolutely return. Would also love to try their lunch sometime too. Lots of the ingredients are locally sourced and/or organic which is awesome. Definitely a cool vibe. And try the coffee!! Seriously unlike any coffee I've had before.\n" u"You will find no better place for breakfast in the Finger Lakes. This place is great for something a little different from the norm and brunch is served every day except Mondays. I had the brie-stuffed french toast and the rabbit ginger sausage - both very good. But my favorite thing about this place? Oddly enough it's their waiting room. On the second floor you will find an upscale room with seating and tables along with a decent-sized cash bar serving beverages like their beet orange mimosas their famous Bloody Mary and more. It's the first time I found myself not minding the wait for food. This will be a staple stop on all my Finger Lakes trips in the future. Pro tip: On-street parking is sparse so either avoid their busy time 10-1 or plan for a long walk.\n" u"This is my favorite place to visit for brunch in Ithaca whether I'm there for a day trip or a long weekend. The decor is as expected from the name and has a carriage house vibe - like a gorgeously upgraded horse barn - lots of stone work a homey cozy vibe with a fireplace. The upstairs has additional seating while you wait for your table and where you should go to grab a coffee from their mini-cafe. \n\nMy friend ordered the bloody mary and I instantly regretted not doing the same. I had a sip or two and it was one of the best bloody mary drinks I've had in a while. Very rich and thick the seasoning was just spicy enough no need for an array of garnishes getting in the way of that hearty tomato-vodka beverage. So be sure to order that. What I had was also wonderful and complemented my brunch entree better anyway - mimosa with Red Jacket juice.\n\nEverything on their menu is alluring. I typically go for a savory brunch option and was eyeing the sconewich. But I couldn't resist the brie stuffed french toast and ultimately ordered that. It was the best choice I've ever made. I ate every last bite. The berry coulis was perfectly sweet and paired well with the melted brie between two fluffy toasted slices of brioche. The home fries are also insanely delicious - very crispy large chunks of potato and super garlicky. I could eat those all day long.\n\nIt's often busy so be prepared for a little wait.\n" u"One of my two favorite places to eat in Ithaca. I've been here four times already in my one and a half years here.\n\nSuch a beautifully cozy ambience that will suit your mood whether for a lively brunch with a group of friends or a romantic rendezvous for two. I really love their rustic interior with all the lights and the intimate spacing. \n\nThe food is itself is great with good old breakfast options and sandwiches but each dish is made with care and special attention to each ingredient and you can tell from the nuanced taste. I love their brioche french toast: perfect balance of sweet and tart. The pulled-pork sandwich is also rather unique\nwith a tangy Asian slaw. I hope to come back very often and try more items on their menu.\n" u'Came here the day before thanksgiving and there are many empty tables! Su lucky since my friends told me that usually the waiting is more than an hour.\n\nWe three shared their signature French toast and Bahn mi. The dish took a while but is worth it!\n' u"Carriage House is one the last proper brunch spots left in the collegetown area usually visited by Cornell students when they want to celebrate a special occasion.  The atmosphere is very warm and cozy with a barn house feel which is a true treat during harsh upstate winters.  The food is quite good and hearty and as many other reviewers pointed out the brie stuffed French toast is a local favorite.  Prices are very reasonable (a full brunch probably won't set you back more than $20) for the quality of the food service and atmosphere.  \n\nThe space is relatively small (30-40 tables at most) so if you expect to snag a seat after 10AM for weekend brunch good luck.\n" u'Wait was little long but it was expected for a popular place on a busy Sunday brunch. Crowded and lively. Very friendly staff. Food was amazing! everything was well cooked and balanced. Oh the coffee was lit as well. GRAZIE\n' u'Wasn\'t that special...had heard so many great things so figured I had to try. Went at a time that was relatively not busy and ordered "Special" after realizing the breakfast menu did not have many egg options. Portion was small and was still hungry after eating. Taste was fine but nothing special could have made it myself. And it took way too long for a simple dish of scrambled eggs.\n\nHowever I\'ve heard that the French toast is incredible as are other menu items so maybe will try again.\n' u'This place was so great!!!\n\nFirst recommendation: brie stuffed brioche French toast. No frills on top to try to dress it up (think creme fraiche berries fillers etc) just on its own...plain...and just delicious. Would recommend splitting it because very very sweet and too much for one person. Amazingly satisfying to eat half of it and pair it with a savory dish.\n\nSecond recommendation: pesto Jarlsberg grilled cheese. Perfect cheese to bread ratio. Pesto really dresses it up. Light greens on the side breaks up this otherwise heavy dish.\n\nDecor inside is cute and warm.\n\nThe type of place id visit regularly if I was a local and a place id take out of towners.\n' u"Limited menu but the service and taste of food make up for it. I love how the decor resemble that of a small town eatery. Quick and friendly service this place earns top rating for hospitality and warmth. \n\nI ordered the omlet with multigrain bread  plate. Loved the taste of it! The seasoning tasted superb. It pairs well with the English Breakfast tea. The restaurant prepares the tea so you don't need to wait for the tea to brew. What a brilliant idea! \n\nAs a visitor I see many locals come into this place. A friend of ours recommended the Carriage House for brunch. Good choice! Even the we waited for 15 minutes for a table it was well worth the wait. \n\nThe prices look fair and the Carriage House prepares a good plate portion. \n\nWhen we go back to Ithaca we will definitely come back here for brunch. While visiting this quaint town stop by the Carriage House. You won't be disappointed!\n" u"Brie stuffed French toast!!! Where have you been all my life?!  And why are you not at every single brunch place in NYC?\n\nThis dish alone is worth a meal here.  \n\nIf you need another reason home made ketchup.  We tried to buy some but they won't sell.\n\nPotatoes sconewich etc were not bad not great.  Espresso - have had better.  But ignore all this and come here for the French toast.  Bring someone.  It's big enough for two - or three or four.\n\n(Note: I didn't go to Cornell so rest assured this review has no personal ideology involved other than food as a religion.)\n" u"THIS. IS. MY. FAVORITE. PLACE. IN. ITHACA. \n\nI don't give a lot of 5 star reviews. Even the reviews I give typically have at least one negative.  I have no complaints about the Carriage House. After hearing about it driving past it and googling the menu countless times...I finally made the trip for brunch one day and have come back almost every weekend since. \n\nBrie French Toast. Everyone loves it. I did too.\n\nMore than the great food is the ambiance. The upstairs loft that they've renovated is absolutely gorgeous. I have been trying to find someone to go to happy hour with me just so we can sit in such a cute space...\n\nI had high hopes the first time I went to the Carriage House and they've yet to disappoint. Hopefully the trend continues.\n" u"I wish they had unlimited coffee refills because that was pretty great coffee. \n\nThe atmosphere is super relaxed and pretty. We drank our coffee slowly and browsed through some magazines before and after our meal. \n\nThe Brie French toast was to die for. \n\nOnly wish it weren't so pricey for the portions but I would still say it was pretty worth the splurge.\n" u"I read reviews for this cafe on Yelp and was excited to try it out when my husband and I were in the area. It was a bit smaller than I expected and so was the menu. I got pretty standard breakfast fare and it was good. It wasn't extraordinary. \n\nI'd come back when in the area but I don't really get the hype. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.\n" u"Fantastic little place close to the Cornell campus. The 20 minute wait for a table was well worth when  it.We had the special pecan flour pancakes with a fruit compote and the special Omelette of the day Kale cauliflower and cheddar all served in a timely manner.\n\nCoffee and scones are their speciality and don't forget to take a couple home. \n\n18% service charge is included in the bill to provide higher wages to the servers but please change your final bill to say additional tip rather than leave a blank space for the tip. Many people will miss the service fee on the bill. I thought about reducing my review by one star for this but the food and service are just that good!!\n" u"Great little restaurant in town. We went for brunch and I was delighted by the non-traditional options which make this place all the better. Brunch is served on weekdays until 3 PM. I had the french toast with the freshest maple syrup I've ever tasted and berry coulis drizzled on the bottom of the plate. \n\nTheir servers were attentive and made great suggestions based on each individual's palate. \n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get five stars is the charge for refills on cups of coffee and the lack of options for bread for their burgers and such. Also this place adds an automatic gratuity to parties of any number of people which I didn't mind because the service was fantastic.\n" u'If you are gluten free you shouldn\'t come here. The gluten free options are limited to the salad and any sandwich. They will not even make you French toast with the gluten free bread that they have because they "only make it on their own bread." \n\nIn addition the 18% gratuity that is included in the bill results in unmotivated waiters that put little to no effort into remembering what you ordered or even trying to bring it to you. We had to request coffee twice and cream three times before our waiter finally remembered to bring it to us and we actually had to get up from the table to obtain the small bowl of jam that we had been waiting an hour for.\n\nFinally and this is just my opinion as a gluten free person who could only pick from about 4 items on the menu most of the food sounds really gross and weird.\n']
157.Burger King,[u'The best food in town -- great drive through service and they accept coupons from everywhere ... very friendly too I especially like the survey you can do on the back of the receipt to get a free whopper !!!!!\n' u'Possibly the worst fast-food restaurant I\'ve ever seen.  Briefly: \n\n1.) While the customer/seating area was relatively clean the "behind the scenes" was atrocious - food on the floor surfaces not clean etc.  I should have bailed at that point but we were in a hurry and had already committed (plus I figured - how bad could it be?  All fried food).\n\n2.) No one had any idea what was going on.  Typical conversation behind the counter was: "Did they order fries?"  "Wait did they order fries?" "It says on here they ordered fries.  Did they order fries?" \n\n3.) I\'ve never waited 20 minutes for fast food particularly when I was second in line in a dead restaurant but I certainly did here.  I had this delightful exchange with the guy behind the counter after he finally noticed I was still standing there waiting for my order: \n\nHim: You had the two whoppers?\nMe: No kids meal and a chicken sandwich.\nHim: Not two whoppers?\nMe: No kids meal and a chicken sandwich.\nHim: It looks like two whoppers.\nMe: No kids meal and a chicken sandwich.\nHim: Oh yeah - I see it.  Kids meal and a chicken sandwich.  Not whoppers?\nMe: No...I swear.\n\nIf you think this is exaggerated it\'s literally verbatim.\n\n4.) We left and I opened my sandwich only to laugh...I got a freaking fried fish sandwich.  \n\nSo - you probably should avoid this place unless severely under the influence.  This is one of the few (if only) instances where I really would do zero stars if it were an option.\n' u'The worker purposely forgot to put the 2 large fries that I had ordered with the rest of my food. Ridiculous and when I asked if that was everything he said yeah. Never go to this Burger King. The place was basically empty except for only one table being occupied.\n' u"Went to order food but had to use the restroom first. It was disgusting I couldn't even sit on the toilet to pee. It doesn't even looked like they cleaned their bathroom in weeks. Makes me wonder how dirty everything else is. Won't be eating there ever again. I've worked in fast food before and I never ever let my bathrooms get that disgusting busy or not.\n" u'The only reason I gave this a star is because 1. Yelp requires me to and 2. the girl that took my order was polite and helpful.  I waited 20 minutes for a $1 sandwich and a kids meal.  I also watched 3 different orders get sent back not 1...not 2...but 3 times a piece.  \n\nThe dining room is filthy...not dirty...filthy.  There was an army of ants on the window sill getting ready to carry home half a bun.  Another customer pointed this out to the staff....no one took care of it.  Merp! \n\nThe food was terrible.  The patty was so rubberized I threw it out.  It was inedible.\n\nNever again...at any Burger King in the world...\n']
140.Mama Teresa Pizzeria,[u"It's gross in there. It is possibly the dirtiest restaurant I've ever been in. It was hot and the cooks were short with each other. They do have a pizza oven so they must make their pizza on site but everything else is pre-made frozen food they fry up for you (you can tell by the box labels taped to the counter). We ordered a couple of slices of pepperoni and wings. Both had been pre-cooked and were not re-cooked (and therefor overcooked) for us. \nWhen we got home with our food it was okay but our experience of stopping in to order it and witing for it to be made really made us regret our decision.\n" u"Wish I had checked the yelp reviews before ordering pizza and wings here. This place completely shoots itself in the foot by trying to have great prices necessitating that they use bad ingredients. This is place is straight out of one of those kitchen nightmare shows. It's REAL dirty in that kitchen. The wings came from a plastic bag in a freezer and had already been deep friend and frozen together in a block and were practically inedible. I would rank this as the worst pizza I've ever had. Little Caesars pizza tastes gourmet in comparison.\n" u'I got this via Ithaca to Go (no complaints there wonderful business) and was excited to be able to enjoy some Italian food. However I got the worst fettuccini Alfredo in the world. The sauce was watery and there was an excessive amount of spices that were not tasteful heaped on top. The chicken was the worst cut imaginable and was literally dark brown. The garlic knots were cold and tasted worse than wonder bread. They included some kind of sauce-it tasted like it came straight from a Heins ketchup bottle. Never again\n' u"Worst pizza I have EVER had in my life and I've had a lot of pizza. The cheese slice looked rancid and the buffalo chicken wing pizza was literally hot sauce spread over bad dough. The cheese looked almost grey it was cold and the sight of it actually made me nauseous. Do not do not DO NOT order from this place. Absolutely disgusting.\n" u"So salty it was disgusting. I had a group of friends ordering and we felt like we were going to have a heart attack from all the salt they put on. I hate this place. Don't ever go here.\n" u'Its pizza how could you not like pizza. Left my iphone 6 there outside on the table cant believe they had it when i came back 2 hours later thanks guys\n' u'Cheese slice is actually not half bad if you can get past how filthy the place is. Guy who runs the place needs a bath. Do flies come with that? Yeah maybe. Gross. This place needs a wrecking ball....\n' u'Grubhub has them listed and I ordered a shrimp scampi (which is a meal which comes with garlic knots and a drink I ordered a lemonade) as well as an additional ziti (to make the minimum for the delivery). \n\nThey brought my food but didnt have lemonade and I didnt want the sprite they brought and gave it to the delivery man. They forgot my ziti and I explained the situation and asked (via grubhub) for a refund for the ziti. Grubhub retuned my complaint saying that the restaurant would not give me the refund because the drink was free (which it wasn\'t but I didnt care much since I "gave" the sprite to the driver) and insisted that I got my pasta.  Grubhub however apologised and gave me a refund for the missing ziti. \n\nMy shrimp in my shrimp scampi pasta meal tasted good. I thought that there was very little "sauce"/flavour for the pasta and basically paid $9 for ~10 shrimp...\n' u"Ithaca to go recently put up a Ithaca's Latin Food section which has items from this place. I can't speak to the Italian fare they serve but this was hands down the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. The enchiladas I ordered were cooked with Velveeta and soaked in taco sauce straight from the bottle. Inside were sad lumps of tough chicken-like meat with minimal flavor. If your 6 year old kid made enchiladas for you it would be better than this schlock. This was not the kind of food that makes you shrug and then you never think about it again. This was not even the sort of Mexican food you'd find in a hospital cafeteria. This was the kind of dinner that gets you on a reality TV show about worst restaurants in america.\n" u'I ordered from this restaurant through grub hub it was so disgusting. One of the worst pizzas I ever had. It was soaked in grease and just tasted bad.\n']
146.College Town Pizza,[u'amazing food. Would bang. AgAin. and again. Really great cheese pizza and seating area. a great end to the night. Part of what gives Ithaca the ~ithaca~ vibes\n' u"Yesterday I had pizza at Zachary's in Berkeley and it was ok. Today I had pizza here and it was amazing. The Chicken Parmesan pizza is one of the best pizzas I ever tasted. Fair price quick service and delivery and polite staff. \n\nIn the battle of Ivy League pizza which is something I invented Cornell is winning. Try this place!\n" u'I ordered an XL meat lovers pizza from here last night. it was $30 to have it delivered.\n\nall I can say is: pizza was yummy. but no way in hell does the taste match the price. that is all.\n' u"Has this place ever been cleaned? Where is the Department of Health? The floors are beyond dirty and the walls are covered in some sort of filth. \n\nLate night pizza even after a night of drinking is gross.  Seriously how is a restaurant allowed to be so dirty? By the way the pizza isn't particularly good anymore.\n" u"Worst pizza I've ever had. Not only that made me sick afterwards. Extremely rude staff. Yelled at me because HE misheard me. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.\n" u'Disgusting. There were flies all over the pizzas and the workers were completely indifferent. Completely unsanitary.\n' u"Pizza is mediocre. Good enough for those midnight cravings. The staff is RUDE. The man behind the counter literally snapped his fingers at me asking for my card. I will not be back here; I don't need to be treated that way.\n" u'We ordered a large pizza from CTP for delivery today and were BEYOND disappointed. We paid $21.50 for a large pizza and two water bottles which is outrageous. I wouldn\'t have been so upset with the price had the service been better.\n\nWe ordered the pizza in the early afternoon and waited for a good 45 minutes; there was no call about our order. \n\nI then got a call from a woman at CTP claiming that the delivery driver had been trying to call me on my cell but could not reach me. Beyond bad customer service for blaming the customer when we had not received a call. She proceeded to ask me if this had been the correct number saying I gave them the wrong number. It seemed that this would indeed be the right number if we were talking on the phone on this number right? She then very rudely told me she would send the driver back in a very sarcastic tone saying that this was a waste of time on their part. I admit I tried to remain calm throughout this whole conversation; the tone she was using was absurdly rude and inappropriate.\n\nWhen the pizza guy did come he was extremely rude when calling me that he was outside our building. He hung up on me when I said I would go outside. Instead of going outside myself someone else went out to pick it up. The deliverer called my friend "impatient" and a few other words that are inappropriate to post here. My friend did respond to this as he too was very frustrated. \n\nThe pizza was cold and hard. The cheese was artificial and the whole thing tasted like plastic.\n\n\nThe irony of this whole experience is that we\'re hospitality majors and we\'re doing a project on bad restaurants. Looks like we found one.\n\nI vow I will never return to CTP. I am disgusted with not only the food but the service. They should really shape up their business. It\'s ludicrous to believe that they\'re even still in business. The owners need to evaluate their business and train their employees better. CTP lacks professionalism and good service that restaurants are without a doubt expected to have.\n' u"Decent pizza but $3.50 per slice is pretty steep. There is a lot of variety though. I liked the usual pepperoni and sausage pizzas. I tried the barbecue chicken once and wasn't a fan because the barbecue sauce easily overpowers the taste of the rest of the pizza. There are lots of other interesting-looking options but I haven't tried them yet. Also compared to other places I really like the crust their pizzas have.\n\nChicken wings here are pretty good too but they kinda overdo it with the sauce. I didn't think having the box tilted slightly in the bag would be a big deal but so much sauce flowed out.\n\nThey're pretty fast at getting your pizzas ready but other than that their service could use some work. One time I asked for a slice to go with an order of chicken wings so I could bring it back to my office and the guy rolled his eyes at me like it was an inconvenience for him to give me a box for a single slice. I don't see what the big deal is; those boxes are barely big enough to fit two slices anyway.\n\nDespite all the bad things I pointed out it does make a good late night option and occasional lunch stop when I need something quick.\n" u"My fav place in town since tthe old location next to Stellar. They always make great chicken wings and really fresh pizza. One thing I like is they're really have a great consistant for both customer service and food quality. I really like it. \n\nAnd two things I don't like is the chicken wing sauce is venigar smells too strong and the table and the window are not really clean and always dusty. But overall it's my long time  great place to hang out.\n" u'I\'ve never been quite a big fan of CTP but their service and product are both so horrific that I\'ve decided that putting up with it is not worth it.\n\nProduct:\nWhen they don\'t mess up your order the pizza itself is mediocre at best. I\'ve been going for the past 2 years and I\'ve never tried a slice there that was phenomenal. On top of that slices are now $3.50 each. That\'s absurdly high given that I could buy a full Papa John\'s pie for the price of 2 slices of CTP\'s junk.\n\nService:\nThe other day I ordered a simple plain slice. What I got back was a charred mess. I would have expected that the chef would say "Looks like we overcooked it would you like another slice instead?" But no the chef did not ask that. When I politely pointed out that my slice was burnt and I wanted a new one the guy tried to charge me again for his mistake. \n\nThat should have been the end of it but it wasn\'t. I went back later that week to maybe give them another shot. When I reached the front of the line to order the man behind the counter skipped over me and asked what a large group behind me wanted first. When I politely tried to chime in after the other group so I could get my snack the guy skipped me again for a group behind me.\n\nDisclaimer:\nI understand that they have to put up with drunk college kids but that in no way excuses their service issues. Other stores in the area provide perfect service to both drunk and sober clientele.\n' u"I recently ordered a burger from this establishment  which was quite delicious  but I more so had a problem with the service. Long story short my failure to tip got me a major tongue lashing from David a CTP employee. \n\nI received my food and we went our separate ways. David then calls me back asking for a tip and when I tell him that I decided not to tip that is when he proceeds to blow up on me and tell me how I shouldn't be ordering out if I can't afford to tip. I've never received treatment like that from any employee at any eatery. I'm confused as to why he even felt comfortable enough to call a customer and begin to snap on them for not tipping him. \n\nHe sure as hell won't be getting a tip any time soon with that attitude. I was offended and appalled to be treated in such a way by David. I hope CTP does something about it and does not allow him to continue treating customers in this way. They'd be turning away good business if they do.\n" u'Pretty mediocre pizza and expensive at that. \n\nSomething to point out is that because this is Muslim run there are no pork products used.\n' u"Don't be thrown off by the graffiti all over the wall this place has very good pizza. OK the new location doesn't have any graffiti :( . I love my crust thin and crunchy and CTP does the best job. Plus they are lightning fast and open way late at night. Unfortunately the place is kind of expensive for the amount of pizza you get.\n" u"The Good: Okay this pizza tastes good and there is a lot of different slices to choose from and the taste is 4/5.\n\nThe Bad: each slice is $3.5 now I don't know about you but I can get a medium pizza from dominoes for $7 and it will taste almost the same.\n" u'Pizza is pretty good but at $3.50/slice kind of pricey relative to peers. I had a slice each of chicken broccoli and pepperoni.\n' u"Yum!\n\nIf you want late night pizza this is the place. It's not amazing or anything but it's decent yummy pizza for prices that college kids can afford.\n\nI like their garlic knots.\n\nService is pretty quick and I applaud the staff for putting up with the stumbling drunk kids who take over the place in the evenings.\n" u"With a place that is covered in walls that have scribbles graffiti artwork and everything in between you should not have high expectations for quality food. Instead this place is a quick fix for your late night munchies after a drunkfest. It will regularly be busy around 1am so prepare to wave your money around at the small counter and jump at the chance to say your order.\n\nPizza and wings here will hit the spot but are by no means something to rave about. My go to pizza is the chicken broccoli pizza fresh mozzarella pizza or garlic white pizza. The fresh mozzarella pizza has pieces of basil and big pieces of mozzarella which I love. I've also had the chicken wings which are doused in a ton of sauce. After you eat the wings there will still be a thick layer of sauce left in your tin take-out container.\n\nService is pretty quick and prices aren't too shabby. You get what you pay for. The place is very small with minimal seating so your best bet is just to bring it home. Girls beware: if you are dressed nicely (let's say cute dress & high heels) the guys who work here WILL give you a creepy smile and undress you with their eyes.\n" u'Pretty low quality pizza and quite expensive. I once liked their chicken club sandwich but the quality was never consistent. One time it was so terrible that convinced me to give up buying the sandwich.\n' u"Just ate a bunch of slices delivered to a seminar on campus and I must say wow even their fresh pizza tastes like crap. Bland rubbery and very greasy I definitely don't recommend dropping by this place in person or even bother ordering from here. A solid chain like Papa Johns does pizza so much better. I feel bad that our guest speakers were treated to such pizza after making it all the way out to Ithaca.\n\nSpecific slices I had: Pepperoni Cheese Vegetarian and Sausage. Bleh.\n"]
72.Louie‚Äôs Lunch,[u"So this was the first time I ever ate food from a truck. So expectations were kind of low to middling. \nEverything was once in a truck. Everything at every restaurant got there by truck. Everything at every store. Everything you've ever worn sat on every TV every picture frame on your wall was delivered at some point by truck. \nSo why is it weird to just eat at a truck?\nWell it isn't anymore. Food trucks are a thing now every city has dozens of them. \nSo I was surprised at food truck #1 that they could produce fresh high quality subs and such. Good food. Usually a line sometimes not a line. \nIf there's no line definitely stop there even if you're not hungry. It's that good.\n" u'Not a one star place but today they gave me maven chicken cheese fries without the chicken AND THEY DIDNT ANSWER MY CALL\n' u'I got a pizza burger and mozzarella sticks. They were both great I devoured them within moments. The pizza burger was a patty with tomato sauce pepperoni and mozzarella. The peanut butter milkshake was also a solid decision. Would definitely get all of those items again!\n' u"I came here on my birthday at midnight and I am mad about Louie. The mint milkshake was DAAAANK. It should be a controlled substance under DEA regulation 'cause it's so addictive. Please come here and buy them.\n\nFor food I had the kraut dog which was aight. Not worth breaking my vegetarianism for .\n\nService was prompt and friendly. No complaints.\n" u"Louie's Lunch has consistently been one of the best value locations for greasy food.  Though their lines and wait times may be long you can avoid that by calling and placing your order ahead.  There is a $5 (or $10?) minimum for credit cards (Discover/Visa) which is something to keep in mind.  Highly recommend their milkshakes.\n" u"Open really late decent options and relatively good prices. Louie's is a North Campus staple that a ton of Cornellians stop by for late night meals/snacks as a freshman or whenever they're on North for some reason!\n" u"I am so surprised by the good reviews customer service was good and if you are getting a burger/cheeseburger you can't beat the prices. However I had the phillysteak and the hot wings~ $15. Both were bad I am sorry but very bad. Tasted like Walmart frozen wings deep fried then drowned in Walmart hot sauce. The phillysteak the bread was not toasted and it was full of mayo (maybe for flavor?) just horrible. I feel bad because the lady was so nice but they should check youtube for quick recipes. Suck because it is very convenient right on cornell and open late. Just go to commons ave if you want food with decent taste.\n" u'Louie\'s Lunch is a staple in the Cornellian diet. This janky looking red truck across the street from the lair of the archies (aka Risley) comes with a cute doggie to pet outside while you wait for your food.\n\nGet the cajun fries the double bacon cheeseburger the mavin or chicken parm. My wife and kids is also amazing for a breakfast sandwich.\n\nAlso it may sound really cool to be THAT guy and get the "XXX" hot sauce and try to be really manly as you crush it the tears and the agony on the toilet afterwards is probably not worth the agony (*challenge accepted*).\n\nMiss this place...\n' u"I hadn't been back to Louie's since living on North Campus but last night I had a serious greasy food craving so obviously Louie's was the answer. It was just as delicious as I remember! Definitely yet the chicken fingers mozz sticks or Cajun fries. Basically anything fried is a winner... Enjoy the freshman 15!\n" u'As far as greasy convenient food goes one can\'t really ask for much else.  The offerings cover all late-night bases from "bored of studying" to "bored of the terrible party occurring at Zeta Psi."\n\nBeing from Buffalo I consider myself pretty good at spicy food and yet getting the maven fries at heat level XXX was deeply regrettable.   0/10 would not recommend\n' u"I have nothing but the fondest of memories of many a late night at Louie's Lunch in college. I miss this food truck terribly and would make the 4.5 hour ride up to Ithaca just to get their cheeseburger Cajun fries and peanut butter milkshake. Gonna have to do that soon as a matter of fact!\n" u"I had such high hopes for this place.\n\nI was walking around Cornell and always wanted to try one of the food trucks. I ended up finding this one so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was totally in the mood for a grilled cheese so I ordered it. When I got it however the bread was REALLY burned. Like the bread was completely black. But I mean the cheese was good I guess. I could have done a better job myself.\n\nHowever I give this place two stars because 1) the guys working the truck were really friendly. 2) I'd be willing to try another food item from this truck. Maybe grilled cheese just isn't their thing.\n" u"Surprisingly good food from a greasy old (now somewhat new) truck.  Even though the quality of some ingredients isn't the best what they add to it makes (sauces chili etc.) the food really taste good.  \n\nDo not get the XXX sauce on anything.  It's got just a little too much of something and it will destroy you Yankees.  X and XX are just right and very tasty.\n\nOne thing that would make Louie's better would be online ordering.  They are sometimes too busy to take phone orders.\n\nGood brownies and cookies too.\n" u"Louie's is an amazing place. their double bacon cheeseburgers and cajun fries are among the best hands down.  their cashiers are nice and it is open until late :D. if you are down after a prelim this is the best way to get of up from that. \n\nhighly recommend 5 stars!\n" u"Louis' let my dog into their truck to warm up in the 0 degree night. Not only were they personable but they cooked an incredible cheesesteak instantly! I'm from Philadelphia and I assure you that Louis' has the only worthwhile cheesesteak in Ithaca.\n" u"I always look forward to coming here when I run out of food in my room but think it's a little expensive for their subs which have literally only 4 to 5 small pieces of meat inside the bread. (A sub is about $7) So I started getting their chicken fingers with a mix of bbq and hot sauce instead since I can skip the bread and have more meat while saving $2. \n\nThe cajun fries are a little soggy but I still like them.\n\nTheir milkshakes are so good I definitely recommend them. A small is more than enough for me and only $3 or so.\n" u"I like their Philly steak milk shake. And it's really a convenient place to get food for North campus. And it's nice they open during the day for lunch too. just the chef was mean to me and my friend once... and it's always a long wait for food...\n" u"Ron runs the *best* lunch-truck on Cornell Campus.\n\nGood comfort food super-nice staff (full disclosure: Louie's has employed several dorm-mates & friends over the years) *great* late hours convenient location. \n\nHot-Truck ain't got nothing on Louie's Lunch.\n" u"Man oh man I have definitely enjoyed my experiences at Louie's. First visit was during freshman orientation and since then I've decided my favorites are:\n\nPeanut butter/chocolate ice cream milkshake\nBuffalo chicken sub (I'm scared to try XXX but get it as hot as you can stand)\nGrilled ham and cheese on wheat with hot apple cider (YES)\n\nNot sure you can really go wrong with much of anything here. It's good for drunk food good for when you forget dinner and good for when you're in between performances at Risley and Nasties is too far (and so subpar in comparison). But eat it sparingly or you'll have a heart attack.\n" u'The best food truck on campus. The cajun fries are a MUST. Good hamburgers good cheesesteaks good hot dogs. Not necessarily so good for the health--- but luckily Helen Newman gym is right next door!\n']
208.Ithaca Brick Oven Pizza,[]
122.Royal Court Restaurant,[u"This place is Ithaca's nostalgic centerpiece. A fixture in the city this lounge's kitschy charm is authentic and comforting. It's not the newest the best or the most trendy but perhaps the most interesting and definitely worth reserving for a party group dinner or event. The naysayer in earlier posts has blinders on and should stick to the chain restaurants that are the same in every city. The berry pie and carrot cake are the closest to home made I've had outside home. Marilyn the owner is super sweet and Jackie was a wonderful host and server.\n" u"Don't waste your money eating in this shit hole...it was filthy dirty disgusting!...the place hasn't been cleaned since it opened in the 70s ....the same d\xe9cor also...DISGUSTING!!!\n"]
121.Applebee‚Äôs,[u"A regular Applebee's you'll find anywhere else. I ordered a To-Go order it came out promptly and tasted great. The bartender took my order and displayed great customer service by asking if I wanted something to drink and updated me with how my order was coming along. I'd come here the next time I visit Ithaca from California. I recommend this place to any Ithaca/Cornell visitors- can't really go wrong with Applebee's.\n" u"The food was terrible but I was also surprised at how bad the service was. The server (a guy) seemed so annoyed and unhappy to be there (i went at 10pm so maybe he was tired) but the service was horrible and the food disappointing. The prices were food but I should've just gotten frozen dinner from tops down the street it would have been the same and cheaper\n" u"A solid part of the Applebees chain.\n\nOrdered the two for $20 and had Mozzarella Sticks and the 7 oz. Sirloin with Mashed Potatoes. The meal was made quickly hot and tasty. I've had the same meal at other Applebees and this was quite impressive.\n\nSame layout and decor as the last few years but the servers are prompt and friendly. I only get to return to the area a few times a year and this is a great choice for a quick meal especially with a group.\n" u"Just a normal Applebee's .\nCompare to the normal one here is quieter\nYou can see the pictures of Cornell students are everywhere\n" u'Very friendly bubbly staff. \nMost of the dishes are very tasty with a few exceptions. I\'ve been about 20 times in the last 11 years. Have never had a bad experience. They are always very accommodating. \nI love that they have Weight Watchers choices. All the WW choices I\'ve had have been very tasty with the exception of the new Chicken Freshcado which was a total miss. There was no flavor or spice and it was lacking acidity and salt.  I wish they would bring back WE dessert choices. \n\nMy beau had the All You Can Eat Ribs Chipotle flavor and was very happy with them and the seasoned fries. \n\nThe spinach & artichoke dip was also a dud lacking substance and flavor. \n\nBoneless wings were good. \n\nOur apps came out after 18-22 minutes I\'d guess. My BF complained to me but not staff when waiting cause he was hungry. \nAfter they came out 2 different managers came out and profusely apologized for the delay. We hadn\'t and didn\'t complain to staff at all so were surprised when the first offered "adjustment to check". Then the 2nd manager that came over told us he was going to "take care of the meal" for us which we didn\'t really understand exactly what that meant but weren\'t going to complain. He even threw in extra chips and salsa in our to go bag. \n\nAt the end we were waiting for our check and waiting again to see what discount would be and the waitress finally explained there was no check as the whole thing had been comped. Apps beers milkshake entrees and all. We were surprised and confused. It seemed overly accommodating like maybe they mistook us for celebrities or mucky-mucks. Ha ha. We still gave the waitress a $10 tip as she has to make a living. We are still perplexed at this ?new customer service initiative but as my friend said " don\'t look a gift horse in the mouth" and since 2 of them items didn\'t taste good I\'m glad I didn\'t have to pay for them.\n' u"Bartender service in the afternoon was well below satisfactory.  Brought my drinks promptly but then disappeared for while as I sat waiting to order while waitstaff passed left and right.  Maybe they are more concerned about prepping for the dinner crowd that they don't need to worry about the mid-meal customers.\n" u'We are from Cali and have become accustomed to a certain level of quality and customer service. This AB is great!! Great food excellent excellent customer service. The steak just melted in my mouth! Sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked cheeseburger rolls dangerous! Piece-de-resistance is the APPLE CHIMI-CHEESECAKE (warm cinnamon baked apples cream cheese filling rolled in a fluffy pastry shell and served with homemade vanilla ice cream drizzled with Carmel sauce. I have had this dessert more times than I can count and I have NEVER been disappointed.  Overall the experience was divine!!\n' u'We both had bourbon steak mashed potatoes and salad. Food was very good and so was the service. Our only complaints were the cups of dressing was two small and we had a VERY difficult time trying to find the restaurant.\n' u"This is the only Applebees I like. I've been to like 5 others and they all are terrible but this place they have it nailed when it comes to food and service usually.\n\nI usually list details of food but I'll just tell you some of the things that keep me coming back:\n\nChicken Tender Platter (have them toss the tenders in the Honey Pepper sauce you won't regret it!)\n\nOriental Chicken Salad (so good)\n\nFeista Chicken Chop Salad (amazing cilantro lime dressing!)\n\nChicken Wonton Tacos (quite possibly the best app in the history of apps!)\n\nI've tried some other stuff that can be hit or miss like the quesadilla burger the tortilla gets soggy too quickly before you are done eating the burger the mac and cheese is too cheesy it can make your mouth feel too caked in cheese. The potato twisters can be too greasy but the queso is amazing!\n\nThe Spinach Artichoke dip is awesome the boneless wings are good but are just boneless wings. The Southwest Eggrolls are awesome!\n\nOverall this place is my go to 2 for $20 place and I keep coming back. The service is usually spot on the prices are good and I actually like the atmosphere.\n\nAnyways this is the only applebees in my opinion love it here.\n" u"I generally steer clear of Applebee's just because we have so many better options in Atlanta. The food is usually bland portions too large etc. But we were in Ithaca for a wedding staying right nearby at the Ramada and starving/delirious from a 15 hour drive.\n\nSo we sucked it up and went to Applebee's. Most of the 3 stars are for the staff. Super friendly helpful and our order was correct and fast. I almost always get the Oriental Chicken Salad when I go and it was just as good here as anywhere. I really like the new grilled chicken option for this salad that comes with an Asian-style sauce so that you don't end up with just plain old grilled chicken. The regular portion was too large for me to finish in one meal and I'm a big eater. It also had a LOT of cabbage. My husband had a turkey club and fries - totally edible but not very memorable as most Applebee's food is.\n\nThey do serve Pepsi products here which I really was sad about as I was dying for a Coke Zero. I had to remind myself I was not in Coke Country anymore!\n" u"Try white peach sangria if you like light alcoholic drinks if you're there. Also the brownie bites are a good deal if you want a bit of desserts (only a dollar).\n\nThe food is okay. But the staff are friendly and always welcoming so expect to walk out of the restaurant pretty happy after your meal.\n" u"Although there's nothing amazing about Applebee's we all know that Applebee's is always dependable. I usually try to avoid coming here for any form of dinner because I don't think it's worth the price however the happy hour appetizers from 11am to 7pm and 10pm to until closing (usually midnight) are totally worth it when you're feeling the munchies. At night those half-off boneless wings and the spinach & artichoke dip totally hit the spot. I do admit though I'm speaking from the point of view of a starving college kid. Service has never been horrible here even when i go with big parties. \n\nConclusion: You know what you're getting with Applebee's but I don't think that's always a bad thing.\n" u"The whole reason I write reviews is to help other students on tight budgets think up fun date ideas--it's a niche perspective but an important one given the supposed decline of that particular social phenomenon. \n\nUsing that lens Applebee's needs to be revived as a serious contender. It's true the entrees are unholy--packed with sodium and cheese and spliced together into veritable Frankendishes of American fare in huge proportions but some of the straightforward items in the 2 for 20$ deal which also gets you an appetizer are not bad. Case in point: the sirloin steak. Drinks here are sugar-loaded and sometimes I wonder if some wonk could compute Applebee's contribution to US diabetes prevalence. The ambiance fits kitch to a tee but the Ithaca location has some local flair to differentiate it. The service is consistently decent and can sometimes even be good. \n\nThe real thing to do as other reviewers have hinted at is to go see a late-night movie then head to Applebee's for half-off wings. There's something romantic and reassuring about walking hand-in-hand late at night through a desolate parking lot in a non-descript suburban wasteland to Applebee's after taking in the latest Hollywood soma...I mean film. You realize in those moments that you need someone real and you appreciate your partner's quirks more than ever. They become even more human and their company is especially comforting against an American cultural landscape that can seem positively soul-crushing at other times.  \n\nIn short it is completely possible to go to Applebee's enjoy your time there and walk out without having turned into a zombie. Your capacity to read and interpret Foucault etc will not be diminished by consuming a Bahama Mama and some Wonton Tacos-- I promise. \n\n(Also Applebee's is actually a great place to watch sports games).\n" u"And here we are.  I was visited for work and thought what the heck its been years and years since I visited and I'm curious.  The menu is still as nuts as ever; layers of stuff on top of each other like Shrimp & Parmesan on top of Steak; why? what good can come of that flavor?\n\n\nB    Mozzarella Sticks -  the sauce is very ketchupy.  \n\n\nB+   Beef Sandwich - Surprisingly good.  I would actually order this again.  It's a total safe bet.  It's just like a brisket with barbecue sauce and the onion strings on top where great!\n\n\nSomething weird about the food in general here was that nothing was completely hot.  Some of the mozzarella sticks where half hard and the fries with the sandwich were luke-warm.  There weren't that many people in the place... Do they make everything on the menu and just keep it out under heat-lamps?\n\nIf this was any other restuarant I'd give it a 2... but its Applebee's I knew what I was walking into.\n" u'OK so I hate to sound so negative right out of the gate so I\'ll say it first; This Applebee\'s is consistent.  Unfortunately it\'s consistently disappointing.  Consistently slow.  Consistently making me wish that I ate elsewhere.  \nI had a gift card for Applebee\'s so my wife and I went to this location for lunch in early May 2012 only to discover that they were "renovating" for two days but offered us coupons for free appetizers upon our return.  Turns out there\'s an awful lot of tiny print on those freebies including an expiration date just a hair over a month from the date they were given to us.  Needless to say we didn\'t get appetizer\'s....on the house or otherwise.\nWe went on to order our lunch and I ordered a Reuben sandwich with a side of onion rings.  The food took a long time to arrive and I recall that from a previous visit.  The food was OK.  Not bad but underwhelming for sure.  Not that I expected gourmet dining.....I knew where we were.  I just wish it was as good as it could be.  And offering customers who are turned away and cheap appetizer that they end up beating you out of anyway just leaves a crappy taste in my mouth.  So much so that I will make a point of telling my father to please not buy me any more Applebee\'s gift cards.  They are virtually worthless to me.  I\'ll sell them on line or re-gift them to someone I don\'t necessarily care for!  Pass on this place......life is too short to eat here and there are other better places nearby.\n' u"I've only ever used the car-side to-go service and I've never had to wait. Sometimes the food wasn't that warm but I'd gladly take cold food over walking into the restaurant and seeing the knickknacks of local high school memorabilia littered on the wall.\n" u"I used to eat here a lot with my friends back in high school.. Last week my mom and I ate here for dinner and it was A LOT worse than I ever remembered it. I ordered a salad with pecan crusted chicken which tasted good but when I got home about an hour later I had really bad stomach pains and I was sick.....can anyone say food poisoning? I think Applebee's is generally overpriced and has only mediocre food. The salads used to be my favorite thing to order but now that I got sick from one of them I won't be going back!! Yuck.\n"]
83.Tamarind,[u'Really delicious & friendly staff! Love that in the curries their tofu is crispier than a lot of places in town.\n' u"My third or fourth experience dining here recently was takeout. I'd had lunch a couple of times before and had really boring bland unexceptional food experiences and average service. Unfortunately the recent takeout experience was quite poor.\n\nWe ordered tom kha soup pad see ew and red curry. The pad see ew was bland but unflawed lacking good wok quality but having relatively fresh ingredients. The tom kha soup was listless tasting like coconut milk straight from the can with some fish sauce added and some wilted vegetables in it. Kinda gross and uninspired. The curry was the greatest sin an inedible stew of burnt and metallic tasting sauce bitter and searing. I was surprised they served it it was completely unpalatable.\n" u"Their food is beyond great for sure and the prices are pretty cheap compared to other restaurants. Besides the waitress or manager whose name is Nunu (I'm not sure if I spelled it right..) always takes good care of customers. My husband and I go there every week and she always greets us pleasantly no matter how busy they are. I'm pretty sure that this restaurant is the best Thai restaurant in Ithaca!\n" u"Excellent customer service. The waiter and othervwait staff could not be more attentive. Curious to certain items the waiter allowed us tonsample before selecting. The food came out super fast and was absolutely tasty! In fact that was the best chicken satay i've had. We also loved the variety of dipping sauces. My yellow curry was too spicy for me but that's because i'm sensitive to spice. Overall we loved our experience and the food was fantastic. Soft roti as well!!!\n" u'Delivery time took 2 hours!!!!! And staffs not responding to calls either. Foods are already cold when it get here. Suggest going somewhere if you want fast service and good food.\n' u'The food here is amazing! I come to this restaurant almost once a week and am always greeted by very friendly staff. I have ordered the duck noodles bbq pork bbq duck tempura veggies beef noodles papaya salad duck salad chicken satay pad thai drunken noodle pork bulgogi coconut soup curry mango sticky rice and the Thai custard. I would highly recommend all of them!\n' u'The Thai food was great! I came here for dinner with some friends and we ordered the pad Thai pineapple fried rice masaman curry with shrimp sukiyaki and the Thai custard with sticky rice. All of the dishes were delicious and had nice portion sizes! My favorite dish was the pad Thai. The sauce used was delicious and the noodles were chewy and perfectly cooked. The masaman curry was really good too! The coconut in the curry made it smell great.\n\nThe only problem I had was that the service was really slow. There were only two people working for dinner that night. The table was a little small as well we had trouble fitting all four dishes. \n\nI recommend trying the desserts though! The Thai custard was super tasty. I definitely want to come back again.\n' u"Tamarind's Tom Kha soup plays a huge role in fighting my Seasonal Affective Disorder\n" u'Pad see ew with tofu was excellent my friends add pad oration with scrimp and massaman  curry with chicken and loved it. We did take out but I have eaten in several times service is always excellent and the place is not noisy even when crowded.\n' u"I have really enjoyed Tamarind Thai!\n\nThe restaurant itself is very quaint and charming. Nice for a date night or dinner with friends unlike some other casual restaurants.\n\nMy favorites: the fried squid roti appetizer (the curry sauce is SO good) and the Gaeng Dang Curry. \n\nOn many recommendations I tried the Choo Chee Duck but it was too fried for my taste. Also the papaya salad was either missing dressing or doesn't come with much/any dressing to speak of (I ordered it delivery so can't confirm).\n" u"Came here for dinner with friends.\n\nFood - 5\nVery good food. Now i only tried one dish (bulgogi) and my friends had a dish each so i can't vouch for everything. However everything we ordered was delicious.\n\nAtmosphere - 4\nThe place doesn't look special from the outside but it has a nice homey vibe inside. Nothing really special but a good feel.\n\nService - 5\nOverall very good service. Water was refilled. Food came quickly. Orders were taken on time. \n\nValue - 3.5\nSo far this has been the best Thai place in Ithaca for me. Prices are comparable to other places and are very reasonable. Food and service make for a worthwhile trip here.\n" u'I stopped by after went to Booksales on Sunday in May for lunch. I had Basil beef +5 star spicy it served with rice and it was great and tasty. The server was look like Asian Lady. I asked her for hot traytoo and she brought it for me. Overall I had a great experience and happy with my lunch and will definitely be back.\n' u'I recommended steam dumpling and chicken satay for an appetizer.  The chicken is very moist and tender.  Their dumpling is fresh since I notice some restaurants used frozen dumpling.  The Tom Kha Kai (soup) is the best by far even my 9yrs old son ask to come back again the next day(he typically a pasta pizza and sandwiches boy). For our main course we had the chili basil crispy duck and stir fry sukiyaki.  Both dishes were flavorful taste authentic to the native thai.  The server are very nice polite and attentive.\n' u'Great easy Thai spot. Our go to. Love their curries and they are not shy with spices which we love! Good service too!\n' u'Pad Thai is my favorite! They make it just as per specifications. Not to forget their soups are amazing!\nTry the spring rolls too!! It will take a few orders to taste the good stuff in the menu!\n' u'Good Thai food. We got the Pad Thai noodles Red Curry Spicy Basil. All of them were very good. Red Curry slightly on the creamer side due to the coconut milk I assume. Other than the calorie aspect this added to the taste. Tom Yum soup also came out very well - ask for level 2; we asked for 3 & was slightly hotter than expected. Restaurant has parking so one less headache.\n' u'Really poor delivery service. Took more than an hour for the order to get to us. Food is mediocre but what do you expect in ithaca. Thai tea is really sweet but better than Thai basil. I never bother to give reviews on Yelp but this really pisses me off.\n' u'Great experience at tamarind. Walked in at 830 on a Saturday night and was seated immediately. Appetizers and dinner were served quickly. Everything tasted amazing! We recommend the massaman curry(sweet creamy flavor) and the pad see ew and the Thai BBq chicken.\n' u"Food: My friends from Thailand agree that Tamarind is the closest thing in Ithaca to authentic Thai food. They have decent variety on their menu which also includes common Chinese and Korean dishes but we usually stick to the Thai cuisine. The food is spicy and flavorful if a bit on the sweeter side. I usually get noodles of some sort like the Pad See Ew and my wife likes the duck dishes. Curries and Pad Thai are also popular but I find them average.\n\nService: The restaurant seems a bit small from the outside but we don't usually have trouble finding a table. Waitresses are friendly and quick to take your order or refill your glass. In fact my minor complaint would be that after the food is served they come around too often to check on the food. Again very minor complaint.\n\nValue: Recommended for their Thai food which is not outstanding but still among the best in the area. The menu has many options compared to Taste of Thai Express down the street which doesn't have much duck or fish. Call ahead to reserve tables for larger parties which they can usually accommodate.\n" u'The service was so nice. The restaurant looks a little dingy from the outside but the inside is a nice atmosphere. The chicken satay papaya salad and fresh rolls are so good!!!! The beef pad see ew and the mass an curry were delicious as well! I would only say that be careful of the spiciness level because they ask how spicy you want it and it\'s crazy hot even when "mild".\n']
166.Mv Manhattan,[u"This boat is very high school basement like.   The ceiling tiles have stains and are falling out.   I'm just 6 foot tall and my head scraps the ceiling. \n\nThe food is ok but that might be an over statement. \n\nNot a great experience.   The bar tender was really nice.   Lots of booze.   I guess this would be great for a drinking might on the water.\n"]
174.Bibim Bap Korean Restaurant,[u"I ordered from Bibim Bap using Grubhub and the food was pretty good that I decided to give it a visit. The problem is that the place is impossible to find! The GPS couldn't find it so I wandered around by foot around the Commons/W State St area... still no restaurant. I called the number I found online and the lady who answered the phone told me that it was between a bookstore and a pizza restaurant. That night I went out to locate this mystery restaurant between those landmarks. What I found? An empty space for lease. I am so confused! Where did my food come from? I am hesitant about ordering again because it would be nice to know that my food is being prepared at a legit established restaurant and I failed to confirm this.\n" u'I ordered from this place using GrubHub and I regret having done so. I\'ll admit that as a Korean food fanatic I may be more well-traveled than the average person when it comes to Korean cuisine. I\'ve had great Korean food in NYC LA and even in Providence RI. Therefore garbage (for lack of a better term) that I ate at this place can\'t even be called "Korean food" by my book. For starters the smell and look of the food is not traditional; it looked like Chinese food and smelled like Chinese food. Even my partner who I was sharing this meal with said the same thing. Upon tasting it I was disgusted. About the only good thing in the order was the mandoo appetizer which was prepared pan-fried rather than deep fried (which is what I would expect from a legit Korean restaurant). Skip this appetite-ruiner and go to KoKo Korean Restaurant. Now THAT\'S some good Korean food.\n' u"First of all I NEVER write a restaurant review on Yelp because I'm too lazy.\nBut I just had an incredibly disappointing experience here.\nI ordered their $12.95 dak kang jung and my brother ordered C4 with an appetizer.\nWhat we got after 50 minute delivery delay (which the person who brought the food never apologized for) was some shitty food. \nMy dak kang jung consist of exactly five chicken pieces (3 wings and 2 tiny legs).\nAnd both menu came without rice.\nI have ordered the same menu SEVERAL times last year since their opening and this is less than half the portion of what they used to serve for the exact same menu exact same price. \nI called the restaurant asking for explanation and they simply said that they forgot the rice and they would bring the rice for free if we really wanted. and they said the chicken portion is normal (like I am just making up my memory at this place from the same fucking orders I have made continuously). \nThey tried to hung up on me and avoid my questions and I had to call them three times until I at least got a person to talk to.\nI am never going to order from this place again and am extremely dissapointed at the quality of food and service altogether.\n" u"That restaurant shares the kitchen with Samurai Sushi. That's why you can't find the actual restaurant. They only do delivery. That said their food is GREAT. The best Korean food in Ithaca.\n"]
109.Ling Ling Garden,[u"Ithaca Yelp is weird. It's damn good Chinese takeout-- I've never had a single problem. Always quick generous portion sizes and pricing is spot on. It's my go-to Chinese food spot while I'm in Ithaca for school.\n" u"YUCK! No silverware for my take out. No sauces in the bag.  Every Chinese takeout place gives you sauces!!!! \n\nWorst pork fried rice I've ever had. Plain and it had absolutely no flavor. I only had about 6 small pieces of chicken in my combo platter.   D-\n\nGo to Spicy Asian or just find another place. Please.\n" u"This is just on my experience with this restaurant if you even can call it that!\nWe go in and order around say 7pm\n10minutes later another family comes in *business is so slow* so we wait around 30min for our food and the other family gets their food within 10min! Like what the heck. Anyways when we got our food it tasted terrible just horrendous!Just saying if u have a choice don't go here it's a waste of time and money. I would rate a 0star if possible.\n" u'Typical Americanized Chinese food--I wouldn\'t recommend it unless you are absolutely stuck in this area of the city and can\'t get to any better offerings. It is edible and there are probably a few tasty gems on the menu however I haven\'t found them. The staff is also quick and friendly; they will generally process take out orders quickly. So again if you are starving and in East Hill Plaza it might do assuming you don\'t want Subway or Burger King.\n\nThe dishes are Americanized as I said and generally just "meh". One of the things I really don\'t like is that they pack most of the entress with peppers onions and other filler probably to keep costs down. I ordered spicy shrimp the last time I was there and the container was easily half green peppers and another 25% water chestnuts. This doesn\'t leave very much room for actual shrimp. Bleh and not worth it.\n' u"Sat down. Ordered cup of Coke. Debris in water and flys everywhere. Decided to leave as coke delivered. Didn't drink a single sip. Asked to pay $3.00 for untouched cup. Not happy from a long time customer.\n" u"It's true what they say about Chinese food in upstate New York. I made sure to eat a lot of Chinese food on the west coast before starting up grad school at Cornell because I knew I wouldn't be getting anything good for several months. The food here can't even compare.\n\nService here is pretty good aside from the fact that they default to giving everyone a fork rather than chopsticks. The food is mediocre at best. I tried one of the lunch specials - roast pork with fried rice. It comes with a bowl of soup which wasn't bad but the soup and the dish weren't all that spectacular. The whole thing is pretty cheap but not as cheap as the (better) stuff that I'm used to.\n\nIf this is the best Chinese food in Ithaca I think I'll avoid all the other places.\n" u"It's not Americanized Chinese food it's just bad food. I'm not a picky eater and I don't care if the waiter is nice to me but the food is just so awful. The szechuan shrimp had some sad looking chewy shrimp and tasted like hot sauce had been drizzled on top. The noodles tasted like salt and grease. If you're looking for actual delicious Chinese food in Ithaca I would recommend de Tasty Hot Pot.\n" u"We've been ordering takeout from them for YEARS. As far as Chinese food goes it is very Americanized. After trying other places in town I've concluded that Ling Ling is tops in the soup department. They may not make their own stock but it tastes like it. All their other dishes are ample and full of vegetables and meat. I'm sure the Sysco truck makes frequent deliveries there - is there a Chinese restaurant in town that can deny using pre-cuts for veggies and meat?\n\nBut after almost ten years of going there weekly (I like soup clearly) I can tell you that it's clean and I've not once gotten ill after eating their food. You might not think that's a valid aspect of a review but I can't make the same claim for some of the other Chinese food restaurants I've tried in town.\n" u'Decent food rude service.\n\nWe went here with our young kids on a Saturday evening and were surprised the place was empty other than people picking up to-go orders. We soon found out why. The waiter was rushed inattentive unhelpful and outright rude. They had no children\'s menu small portion or "plain" options (couldn\'t even order a side of lo-mein noodles) and anytime we tried to ask a question the waiter was very rude and abrupt. We nearly walked out before even ordering but we were very hungry and curious about the quality of the food. The rudeness continued down to the moment we tried to pay when he took one look at our Visa card and said "No American Express" and turned away. My husband had to chase him down and point out that our card was a VISA and didn\'t say "American Express" anywhere on it. \n\nAnd no it was not a language barrier thing just a "I don\'t give a shit about customer service" thing. After we left we agreed the food was a 6 and the service was a 1. \n\nAs we live very close may still get take out from Ling Ling Garden if we\'re really in the mood for Chinese but I don\'t think we\'ll ever dine in again.\n' u'Great dumplings and good food but the server at lunch was beyond rude and totally killed the experience. With great service I would have given four stars! Food is always hot and fresh the general chicken is the best in town.\n' u"I have gone here two times when I needed to pick up a check at Cornell's payroll office next door. I'm not in east hill plaza often but I have heard good things about Ling Ling so I figured it was worth a try.\n\nOn my first visit I ordered chicken and broccoli for takeout with hot and sour soup. The broccoli was horribly overcooked and mushy. The soup was relatively thin a refreshing positive compared to the cornstarchy stuff served at most places but the flavor was a bit too sour and not hot at all. The next time I ordered one of their generic fried dishes with sweet sauce (maybe general Tso's or orange chicken). It was the typical Americanized Chinese fair. Way too sweet and not crispy enough the chicken was a bit soggy.\n\nOne big plus though is that their takeout containers are very nice. So nice you could reuse them if you want. But that's about the only thing positive I can say about this place. I would give it one star but it is edible and considering there is no really good strictly Chinese place in Ithaca its not like I can recommend an alternative.\n" u'Lunch started off really promising with delicious hot and sour soup so I had high hopes for my entree.   Unfortunately my chicken with garlic sauce was more like water chestnuts with garlic sauce.   The chicken that was there was really tasty but there was very little of it!     My colleagues had the chicken with cashews and fared a bit better with more chicken than mine but still heavy on the cashews.\n\nFried rice was "meh" - I was glad to be eating low-carb and leaving it on the plate.\n' u'Surprisingly good Chinese for upstate NY.  My Chinese wife even liked it.\nWe came in just expecting some passable food on a rainy day.  The decor was not great.  What we got was generous portions and fast service and pretty decent food.  My wife even wanted to go back the next day.\n' u'Surprisingly good given it\'s a Chinese restaurant in upstate NY.  I\'ve spent my share of time in metropolitan areas with numerous Chinese restaurants and while this certainly isn\'t one of them it\'s definitely one of the go-to Chinese restaurants in Ithaca.  \n\nThey don\'t have some of the more "exotic" fare I\'m used to (duck fresh seafood etc.) but the pork and tofu-based dishes I had were great.  Parts of the dining area appear to have been converted into storage space which doesn\'t help the ambiance.  They are neatly clean though and have Tsingtao.  \n\nLike Ron mentions - the name is terribly stereotypical (a given I guess  given the locale)  - and the menu features pandas and bamboo.  However give this place a shot.  I liked it and you probably will too.  But please feel free to order something other than the typical General Tso\'s Chicken!\n' u"lots of food for the price. and good food too. nice pieces of good quality meat instead of other Chinese restaurants. We've ordered takeout  multiple times and never had a problem (never dined in) This is our go to Chinese restaurant when we are in Ithaca.\n" u"I think they must have gotten a new chef recently because I went on Valentine's Day (the bf and I are classy individuals) and were extremely impressed. The vegetables were all very bright-tasting and freshly-steamed the General Gao's Chicken crispy and flavorful. Nothing was soggy greasy overcooked or any of the other bad things that lots of Chinese in the US sometimes can be.\n\nYeah it's Americanized yeah there are pandas on the menu. Who cares? The food was great.\n\nService was also quick space clean et cetera.\n" u"Service is AMAZING. Best for me in years. He comes so quick and doesn't miss a beat. Reminds me of a hopping NYC waiter but in a laid back town and quiet restaurant.\n" u"I always laugh when I think of ling ling gardens. If you're looking for authentic Chinese look somewhere else. But if you're looking for some of that greasy Americanized Chinese stuff then look no further.\n" u'Summary: Awesome chinese for the price. I usually order from taste of thai which runs me like 16 bucks with tip. This place is right next to work for me and the dinner platters include are less than $10.\n' u'Nice place the food was decent (not the best but considering this area of ny it was quite welcome) and the prices were fair.  Service was very quick which was the best part.   Plenty of parking walking distance from Best Western University Inn close to Cornell University.\n']
1.Just A Taste,[u"This place is a taste bud extravaganza! We my 3 sisters and I took my niece there for her 21st birthday dinner and tried over 8 small plat s and two entrees and were very pleased with everything! The prices are reasonable and we loved being able to get Just a Taste of everything our taste buds were longing for! Lol! The place is tiny but don't let that fool ya it has a BIG feel!\n" u"I found this establishment to be very oversold. \nService was good but the food was passable at best. \nMy review likely won't matter. This place was slammed from the minute I got there at 5:50 (they open at 5:30)\nI ordered a cheese plate which was not good. \nI thought I would get some grainy breads and various cheeses. \nInstead I got 3 minuscule slices of white bread some hard cheese and some almonds dripping in oil. \nI also ordered Brussels sprouts. These were pretty good except the cheese and pecans were totally unnecessary. \nService was good and very attentive but the food was sub par.\n" u'I liked this place. I enjoyed my meal. But I don\'t think I\'ll be rushing back anytime soon. \n\nWhen I arrived the place was packed but luckily it was just me dining so I was able to sit at the bar. I was handed a greasy dirty menu to pick from and started off with the Deep Fried Potato Wedges. At this point the waitress/bartender took my menu away which was a little confusing. I have been to authentic Spanish style tapas places. There is an expectation that you pick your entrees piecemeal and typically are left with the menu throughout your dining experience. You\'re supposed to relax but after she took away my menu and I asked for it back it seemed as though they were more interested in just whipping up a bunch of small plates all together and ushering people out.  Long story short I felt very rushed and didn\'t feel like I could really enjoy the menu items how I wanted/expected to.\n\nBut back to the potatoes. They were great. Hot from the fryer and the chipotle Aioli sauce was spot on. After looking at the menu some more I decided on the garlic braised greens. Also ok. I also ordered the Pork Loin Cutlet and the  Chicken wings. \n\nOverall the food was good...decently priced for the portions but I just didn\'t enjoy my experience for a "tapas" style restaurant. I would go back but probably on an off day at an off time.\n' u"A great spot for a tapas-style dinner if you're visiting Ithaca. I was in town for a weekend trip and friends recommended visiting Just A Taste. They don't take reservations so do as we did and arrive just before the rush at 5:30pm. We got seated right away then minutes later the place was packed. \n\nThe local flight was an awesome array of Finger Lakes wines - many tasty dry varieties and a range from bubbly slightly sweeter white and dry reds. $13 was a great price for 5 tastings that rounded out to be what felt like 2.5 glasses.\n- Hermann Wiemer cuvee brut (Can't resist the bubbly - wonderful!)\n- Chardonnay from Standing Stone (I loved this and don't normally get down with many chards)\n- Riesling from Boundary Breaks (not my fave because I don't love Rieslings)\n- Randolph O'Neill Cab Franc (One of FLX greats)\n- Cab Franc from Hazlitt (a surprisingly wonderful pick!)\n\nAs for food while they aren't a gluten free restaurant they have dishes that happen to not include gluten so Dan was fully satisfyed with our options. We shared a range of small plates most of which were lovely!\n- Shrimp with garlic and sherry was a great start to the meal\n- Housemade Italian sausage is a must-try - I'd get this again!\n- Warm brie is always a win. It came with apples and crostini and they tossed a few GF crackers for Dan which was a nice touch!\n- Duck leg was rich and hearty\n- We couldn't resist dessert and shared the chocolate souffl\xe9. Great way to end a wonderful meal.\n\nAn adorable spot to have an intimate meal with friends or significant others before you hit the town. I'll be back again next time I'm in Ithaca!\n" u"Typically when I go out to eat I am looking for a quiet somewhat upscale restaurant with a selection of unique food I can't get anywhere else. Just a Taste is not quiet or upscale but I found myself not minding. If you've ever looked at a menu and wanted to order everything on it this is a great place to go to do that. Menu items are typically $5-9 and it is expected that you order several and share them with your party. This is what makes tapas a fun experience. On top of that Just a Taste has a unique selection of food you won't find at many other places - such as duck leg or deep fried salt cod fritters. It is chaotic loud and greasy but everyone is sure to find something they like on this menu.\n" u'3.5 Stars.\n\nFun-factor : 4.5 stars. \nThere was a line of 30 people to get in when they opened on a Sunday at 6 pm and all of the waittresses were enthusiastic positive and great. \n\nThe Wine "Flights" : 5\nThese are combinations of 4-5 1/3 glasses of wine - essentially a wine taster. They were fun food and a good value.\n\nThe Prices : 2.8 stars\nIt was not bad but a little expensive for the taste and portion size. \n\nThe Food : 3 Stars\nNothing was great and sorta minimally satisfying \nA. Roasted Potatoes - actually deep fried to the point of being almost burned and small portion\nB. Spicy Shrimp : Exactly 4 medium/small sized shrimps for $8 which a "too hot" spicy stew\nC. Clam : The clams were big and healthy - maybe about 10. However the broth (which I have loved at other restaurants) was actually bitter and we left it\nD. Bread : we ordered the bread with cheese and it turned out to be a mini-pizza which was the best dish of all - although I picked some japanenos out - again not much in the way of options for how you want it. It was pretty small but bread and cheese were good. \nE. Romaine Salad : That was actually pretty good!\n\nMissing :\nNo soups\n\nFreebies : 1\n(no free bread chips etc) at all\n\nCustomer Service : Cheerful positive helpful waitresses. They also quickly cleared away dishes and glasses periodically. \n\nService Speed : Pretty good although things came in a random order.\n' u'What an amazing gem!!!\n\nA fresh local tapas restaurant in Ithaca. What we ordered:\nBest/goat cheese salad. Exceptional with the perfect ratio of beet to cheese.\nSpinach salad. Also amazing. Rather heavily dressed with a light dressing....a good combo.\nBaked brie. Option of going light on an apple or more heavy on baked slices of bread. A simple classic.\nCod fritters. Salty light airy amazingness. So tasty and so unique. Loved the tangy creamy dipping sauce to offset the salt.\nLamb. Also very rich flavorful and complex.\n\nLoved everything I tried and was thoroughly impressed.\n' u"On a recent road trip through the Finger Lakes Just A Taste was our favorite restaurant. Too noisy a little too dim but wonderful food!\n\nVIBE: Hip. Dim. Noisy. A bit cramped.\n\nSERVICE: Efficient and courteous. Too loud to communicate much so I can't say much about cordiality or helpfulness.\n\nGOOD: Roasted potatoes were crispy and delicious. Beets with walnuts & feta was tasty as was a baby kale salad with goat cheese. Banana bourbon pecan bread pudding was so lush it ought to be a controlled substance. Nice selection of wines at affordable prices.\n\nNOT SO GOOD: The noise level and lighting level.\n\nThis is one of those places I wish would move to my city. Next time I'm visiting the Ithaca area I will definitely be back at least once.\n" u"We've now been to Just A Taste a couple of times over the course of 2 or 3 years and have never had a dish or glass of wine we didn't like. The tapas and dessert options are all incredible and they have a pretty good selection of beer. Sitting at the bar is a little bit cozy but you get an opportunity to talk to a local which is always fun.\n\nI'd really recommend about any of the wine flights as I've never been disappointed by those and if you're into brussel sprouts I'd really recommend getting a dish (had them with my pal/fiance for the first time roughly three years ago we still talk about them). One of the friendly locals at the bar was pretty disappointed that we didn't order dessert which he said were very good.\n\nAlso for what it's worth the servers and chef are knowledgeable regarding food allergies (gluten and shellfish for sure). Enough of the options on the menu naturally don't contain gluten but it's not explicitly labeled; just ask and they'll let you know what is or isn't. We used to spend a lot of time in Ithaca but even now that we live four hours away we make sure to come here when we visit.\n" u"Everything came out relatively fast and they served us a half hour before closing on a Friday night. The owner/manager was a little impatient with getting us to finish our food and leave but that's understandable.\n\nThe food was incredible! We got the potato wedges with aioli shrimp with garlic Caesar salad braised duck and chicken and potatoes.\n\nI thought the potato wedges were cooked perfectly with a crunch and the shrimp was a really small portion but full of flavor. \n\nThe braised duck was unreal it was really tender and the complete opposite of dry. I don't know what they marinate it with or what's in that sauce but it's definitely worth getting. \n\nThe chicken was really really dry despite the potatoes and sauce which wasn't the greatest but the rest of the food made up for it.\n" u'I really enjoyed my time at this tapas place. My friend and I had dinner here and between the 2 of us ordered 4-5 different items and it was just enough food for us. They don\'t take reservations but we were lucky to come in and find a seat inside (although the outdoors didn\'t seem to have any).\n\nIt\'s hard to recall exactly what we ordered but I\'ll do my best. Let me say that every item was delicious amazing and full of flavor. I noticed that most of my Ithaca reviews are five-stars and there is something about this town that brings out incredible food and locals who care.\n\nWe had the Squash which came with walnuts and some melted cheese. The squash flavor was complimented much by the cheese and the walnuts added to the flavor. A very nice choice to get some fresh veggies in my diet! We also had the "local chicken" dish. At $9 it was a steal and the portion led to some great sharing we also shared tuna meatballs and a mushroom dish. All of these were phenomenal and unique and flavorful. Our server was very professional and had some nice recommendations ready to go.\n\nWe really enjoyed our time at Just A Taste and I would love to go back.\n' u"Delicious. They can take a food I don't think I usually like and make it great. Also the one time I went with a couple friends who have several allergies each the server was knowledgable efficient and accommodating in terms of pointing out what menu items were okay for each of them and what could be modified to be okay.\n" u'I absolutely loved this place. My favorites were the spicy shrimp charcuterie and strawberry ice cream. If you have room for dessert you must get the housemade strawberry ice cream. It tastes like real frozen strawberries. Overall the food was magnificent. The staff are great too. I came on a Tuesday evening for dinner in a party of 8. Basically we were the complicated group that they were able to accommodate last minute without a reservation. They even took care to handle our tabs. Everything was swell.\n' u'As always delicious!!!! I enjoyed some amazing brussels made in briwn butter panchetta and cheese. The Duck breast could have been cooked a bit more rare to my taste but was tender and taste wonderful with the lentils and onions/garlic accompaniment. The spicy shrimp was so plump and fresh and the pork chop was cooked amazingly. Never disappointed!!!!\n' u"Love this restaurant due to it's fair priced and diverse tapas menu - vegetarian friendly! Make sure you get there as it opens on a weekend night as it fills up quickly. I recommend the chocolate cake the potato fritters w the delicious sauce and if they have it the quiche.\n" u'Was a bit pricy but only because we had a bottle of sherry to accompany the delicious finger licking tapas. I would like to go back to this place before leaving Ithaca. Absolutely delightful bread and cheese and every small plate of grilled or roasted veggies were so well balanced with the accompanying cheese or wine. Ate and ate to my hearts content.\n' u'I want to like this place so bad! Unfortunately I feel that their food is desperately trying to reach tapas "status" and falling short with each plate. They do have traditional tapas dishes like "patatas bravas" (spicy potatoes essentially) "bacalao" (salted cod) and charcuterie. They don\'t pay homage to the authentic dish and try to give it a unique take on it but it doesn\'t live up to the true essence. The non-protein dishes were reasonably priced ranging from $5-10 but the price hikes when you\'re in the mood for meat. \n\nThe service was not great. The hostesses are frantically running around trying to seat everyone while the waiters are watching unenthusiastically. My waiter spoke under his breath and looked bored to be there. \n\nI really do like their wine flights. They give good pours and have a variety of eclectic wines all for a great price. I definitely think the wine carried the experience for me.\n' u"Excellent Tapas place in Ithaca! I have been here several times and have numerous dishes. My favorites are the potato wedges and cod fritters. What I like about Just a Taste is its amazing decor and atmosphere. I enjoy sitting outside during the summer with some sangria or perhaps a wine flight (YEAH THEY DO THAT HERE!) and a casual meal. It makes for an excellent date night as well. \n\nThe wait is ridiculous at times. The staff also employ what I think is somewhat of a silly policy for their wait - where you can put your name down and they will call you when a table is set even if you are not at the store when your table is ready. It does make for a frustrated situation especially when it is in the winter or late at night. Waiting for people to come back to claim a table after they were told it would be ready in 20 minutes seems a bit counter-intuitive. That's my rant about the waiting system. Other than that though I love this place!\n\nI would recommend sitting outdoors if possible in the summer. It is very intimate and shaded so it makes for an excellent space. I also see lots of animals seated outside with their owners so it is very sweet and cute. The menu changes from time to time which I really appreciate since the chefs clearly take into account what is fresh and in season. I have had great seafood dishes during the summer - their produce is always super fresh.\n\nI would not recommend coming here if you are starving - as that is a very quick and easy way to rack up the bill. Otherwise come wine and dine and have a great time!\n" u"I love this restaurant!! The location is great and it was walking distance (super short) to my hotel. All the dishes were absolutely flavorful. I enjoyed the Italian sausage with a side of fennel and grapefruit salad. I also loved the Brussel sprouts. The portions were not too small and the food came out at a great pace. I'm sometimes concerned about the food not coming out quickly and the portions being super small but everything was perfect. I had the BEST hot chocolate I've ever had here!! It was made with local milk and was unique from your typical hot coco. The service was good and I don't think it's on the expensive side especially for tapas. If your in town this is a must-try!!\n" u"Keep one thing in mind about small portion tapas-type places; communal appetizer dining ends up being very expensive and Just a Taste is no exception. Now with that housekeeping done my review: The food is very very good...like really good. Diverse menu with some super-interesting selections designed to convince you of a second small portion at an inflated price...see I warned you they'd get you just like big tobacco did in the 60's-70's; and yes the food is as addictive as a pack of vintage full flavor Marlboro's. The staff is attentive knowledgeable and tenured. Long-term staff says it all with respect to profitability and employee satisfaction right? Ambiance is like any other packed restaurant bar with great food and a wine sampling Ivy League professorial clientele...very loud and opinionated. :) Love this place Ithaca. I also understand the selection of beers/wine are good although I have to recuse myself from this portion of the critique since I quit drinking several years ago...had plenty to drink in plenty of places in my life. The biggest annoyance of this portion starving - albeit delicious- wallet eating locale is that regardless of the day of the week or time-it ALWAYS seems like there's a 45 minute wait...regardless if it's packed or several open tables exist. Not sure if it's a branding effort or what...but it's a BK aka Bhoenur(sic) Killer. \n\nRespectfully Yours in anonymity for an entire career. \n\nP.S. Minus 1 star for wait inconvenience pricing tactics and loud environment.\n"]
134.Oak Shield,[u"I eat here every day. This is the best resturant ever in NY. With 150 yrs history it have been serving everyone in Ithaca quite well. It's a legend.\n"]
17.Ithaca Ale House,[u"Ale House is probably my favorite place to go to on weekday nights in the general Commons area of Ithaca.  We come here generally to sit at the bar and chat about our day.  It's a great spot to post up and hang out for a little while.  The atmosphere is lively and casual but also somewhat quieter than many other bars.  \n\nThey have an EXCELLENT beer selection.  I tried a spicy beer from Ballast Point which the waitress warned me was truly hot but I didn't really listen. I have a relatively high tolerance for heat but this beer required me to order another just to chase it with.  It's not something I'd order again but it's a somewhat interesting story to tell now.  Obviously this is in no way the Ale House's fault.  I commend them for stocking the beer as it's not something I see around at many places even those that stock other Ballast Point brews. \n\nMany people have told me the food here is excellent but I haven't gotten a chance to try it quite yet.  Will update soon!\n" u"The staff has been really friendly in the busy popular place. It's in a good location nice beer selection (I would hope with such a name!) !\nFor food there are some good vegetarian and even vegan items on the menu but the group doesn't usually make it here because those items are really over-priced. It's like they have an expensive price for the meat options so they feel they have to significantly jack up the price of the vegetarian options. Why penalize people who are health/environmentally-conscious? \nA $12 veggie burger at a bar? Gimme a break.\nIt is a nice location and we'll still stop in for drinks--most likely though after we have gone elsewhere for food.\n" u'I want to give this place 2.75 stars but I know that\'s not a thing. I like the Ithaca Ale House. It\'s unarguably the best place to get a good/unique/tasty burger in Ithaca but every time I go there\'s something that happens that leaves me feeling a bit irritated. I haven\'t been able to put my finger on it but there\'s just something about the service or the other patrons that bothers me every time. \n\nThat being said the burgers are worth going for. It\'s my goal to try each and every one and I\'m well on my way. Usually I can\'t finish it all and I end up taking it apart and making a "burger salad" with the over abundance of toppings they give you on the burgers. \n\nIf you\'re a low key person who wants reasonably priced good American food go to Ithaca Ale House.\n' u'They have craft beers.\n\nSo do six million other bars in the United States that cater to any audience younger than age sixty three.\n\nThe particular beer I ordered was a pumpkin beer that the waitress told me should be drunk from a stein with a cinnamon sugar dusting on the rim.\n\nIt was like drinking beer and eating children\'s breakfast cereal at the same time.\n\nSo what makes an otherwise run of the mill beer haus a five star Yelp review?\n\n******\n\nSKILLET WINGS SKILLET WINGS SKILLET WINGS SKILLET WINGS SKILLET WINGS !!!!\n\nLadies and gentlemen - the next generation of buffalo wings has arrived on our planet!\n\nThese are wings seared in a cast iron pan like a fajita with two kind of melted cheese scallions and the house "garbage sauce".\n\nThe garbage sauce carmelizes on the wings while they sit in the pan.\n\nEverything that makes fajitas good as they grill in the cast iron pan makes these wings good as they grill in the pan.\n\nAnd buffalo wings with melted cheese on top?\n\nTotally beats ranch dip and celery.\n\n*\nEyeballing what other people were eating the rest of the food here looks damm fine.\n\nOf particular note are any number of burgers stacked high with good stuff -- and served with a murderer\'s knife stuck in the bun and holding the whole thing together like the ultimate toothpick from Alfred Hitchcock\n\nThe cook has a perverse imagination.\n\nThere is nothing but good about that.\n' u'Busy but the service and food are amazing.  Great selection of beer in a clean environment.  Love this place!\n' u"Heard good things about this place so we decided to check it out tonight. Draft list was ok but you could die of thirst before someone waits on you. Placed drink and food order at the same time Because we waited so long. Beer was slightly colder than room temp food was marginal at best. Why do they ask you how you want your burger cooked if they're just gonna cook the hell out of it anyway? We were celebrating my son's birthday but after waiting on poor service all night we were rushed out(given the check) right after entrees without asking for a dessert order. In summation beer warm food sucked with possibly the the worst service I have ever experienced.\n" u'First time here nice atmosphere.  Service was good. Craft Beer selection was great.  Food was very good.  The menu has suggested beer and food pairings. I will definitely be back.  Great location if you are wondering around the ithaca commons.\n' u'I watched Games 6 and 7 of the 2016 NBA Championships here and tried a lot of food. If you want to see a major sporting event I strongly suggest showing up early. If you are by yourself the bar is the best bet; otherwise they won\'t seat you unless the whole party shows up. Outdoor seating is at a premium especially during these busy and nice Ithaca summer evenings.\n\nAs far as food goes the skillet wings are much better than the normal wings though the former comes out on a skillet bubbling with cheese and the scent is a bit overpowering. I opted for the upstate-classic "garbage" sauce which is basically all the sauces combined. It was good but the sauce was basically sweet at that point. The four cheeses used on the skillet were the best part really. \n\nThe Ale House\'s fries are also fantastic and they give quite a heaping portion. If you want some heat ask for the house hot sauce as a side for the fries. I also had a killer sloppy joe one night and it was better than anything I remember eating as a kid. Finally I loved the milk and cookies option for dessert though in a cruel twist of fate the milk glasses narrowed at the bottom and actually didn\'t fit a whole cookie. I know I know ... first world problems.\n' u'I was a little stand-offish about going here at first because it looked like a normal college bar - but the reviews were good and my wife was hungry so we went in. Good beer - local stuff. And the skillet wings... wow!!!! Amazing stuff!! If nothing else go here and get the skillet wings!!!!\n' u'We were visiting the Finger Lakes.  Checking out waterfalls and wineries with our senior aged dog. Ithaca Ale House has a nice front patio that is dog-friendly. \n\nThe server brought the dog a water. And us two cold beers. From a good selection. I had  the Perfect Burger. It was big and tasty. I thought the bun was better than the typical burger bar. \n\nMade for a nice evening. Watching the activity on Aurora St with our pup. Fun.\n' u"The hostess was really rude.  We were waiting for 1 person to park and she sat everyone who came after us in front of us until there were no tables left. We've been there before and the food was great but they were so rude this time.\n" u"I have been to the Ale House a few times for drinks with some friends. Having always ate before I got there I never tried their food. My friends raved about it and everything coming out of the kitchen always smelled so good. My boyfriend came to visit me in Ithaca recently and we were looking for a place to watch the NCAA games. Ithaca Ale House it is!\n\nA-M-A-Z-I-N-G food! We each ordered a burger and what a pleasant surprise it was that they offered gluten-free rolls! The bar was packed so we weren't seated for a good 45 minutes but this was a Thursday night at around 7:00pm so we did not mind. It is also one of the few places in town that had TVs around. Once we sat down our waiter was polite and shared with us the specials which all sounded amazing. After we ordered the wait for the food was a bit long the long side but again it was probably because it was a packed house.\n\nNow for the food. I ordered Ale House Burger because I am a sucker for caramelized onions. My boyfriend ordered the El Inferno Burger. All of Ale House burgers are made with certified Black Angus Beef - so juicy so tender and flavorful. I don't know how many ounces of burger I got but it was just the right amount not too much where I could barely bit into my burger but not too little where I am feeling jipped.\n\nFor dessert we got a little reckless and got the Mrs. O'Leary's Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae which was served with three warm chocolate chip cookies on top of some vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. My goodness - I had gone to heaven - that's what my stomach was telling my brain. \n\nVery affordable and delicious food excited I finally tried their food - no complaints great place for casual date night catching sports catching up with friends etc. Definitely stop by!\n" u"My favorite burger joint in Ithaca as an undergrad. They cooked it to perfection the fries were amazing and the suggested beers they paired were just...too good of a combination. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.\nMake sure to make reservations as this place gets quite busy!\n" u'very underrated. the ithaca ale house is a very very good restaurant. the staff is very friendly and the grilled cheese and tomato soup is really enjoyable. i implore everyone visiting ithaca especially families of college students and prospective students to check this place out.\n' u'Came for dinner hiking buttermilk falls. The restaurant and bar were both packed on a Wednesday evening. I had the blonde ale and my partner had the salted Carmel Porter both were good. We had the guacamole brie melt appetizer and the French dip sandwich and too gouda to be true burger all excellent. Service was a bit slow but probably due to how busy they were. All staff were friendly courteous and helpful.\n' u'Got into town late and some friends ordered a "burger" for me just before my arrival.  Once I walked in the door my Initial reaction (upon seeing what was destined to be in my belly) was "Holy Cow"!  It was in fact the "Fat Boy Burger".  A 1/2 pound of ground beef perched between two grilled cheese sandwiches with all the fixings. I devoured it without shame. The Ithaca IPA that washed it down was just as delightful. \n\nGood service reasonably priced pub atmosphere and easy to find. Parking can be a challenge (I got lucky with street parking) but there is a parking garage close by. \n\nRecommended!\n' u'Great skillet wings. Nachos are so so. Kindof a limited beer selection for an ale house. Great location for people watching. Great service\n' u"Sat at the bar to get a drink before getting dinner elsewhere and watched the bartenders have 5 different drinks together in the short 15 minutes  we were sitting there. While we were waiting for the check and signaling to the bartender to come over she was taking shots with her coworkers... Someone from the kitchen came out to the bar took a couple shot glasses grabbed a bottle and went back to the kitchen....\n\nI get that bartenders drink together but to see all the employment get trashed together in front of me was just unprofessional. They're not even trying to really hide the fact that they're ripping shots 3 times in a row while taking a while to get to customers.\n" u'Came on Friday with a large group. Was really crowded. Asked for rare burger. But into it and it\'s well done. Told the waitress. "Oh. I\'m sorry. I\'ll let the kitchen know. ". Not " would you like another?" Or something like that. I\'m thinking at the end she\'ll discount it. NOT. horrendous. \n\nDecided to stop by and try again. Ordered burger with crab cake. Rare. The burger was medium well the crab cake was mostly filler and was refried. Greasy to no end. Oil was dripping from it at every bite.\n' u'If you find yourself in Ithaca and have a craving for a good burger and a beer I highly recommend this place. A dozen or so burgers of various incarnations are offered here along with other standard pub food. Good selection of craft beers 20 or so on tap along with many by the bottle. I had the "Perfect Burger" which was true to it\'s name. Half pound burger cooked medium rare to order topped with cheddar thick bacon pickles LTO mayo mustard ketchup. Sounds like a lot to pile on a burger but everything was proportioned "perfectly". They offer a choice of sides. Small salad fries or onion rings. I had the onion rings which were really good. This place appears to be very popular. We were there early around 6:30 on a Monday night and easily got a table but by the time we left about an hour and a half later the place was packed with a line of people waiting to get in. I heard the hostess say the wait was 45 minutes. Go early or go late.\n']
161.Capital Corner Restaurant,[u'Big portions reasonably good prices.  Every dish was well made---good taste but not quite stellar.\n\nWe came here three times and every time was consistent.\n' u"Included some pics since people keep talking shit about this restaurant without any evidence. Anyways it's actually more 4 stars but I needed to even out the ratings and the food here is definitely edible unless you order all the basic white people dishes.\n" u'Really uninspiring American food court Chinese food. Goopy sweet sauce. The pork fried rice was particularly bad with an unpleasant aftertaste.\n' u'A Haiku:\n\nEggFooYoung Water\nDragon Phoenix so boring\nDisappointing food\n' u"General Americanized Chinese food about on par with Panda Express or anything like that. There's nothing outstanding about it and nothing really scary either.\n\nTheir service is a nightmare--it will take forever to get food if you happen to go in on the weekend. They won't tell you this when ordering either. I walked in and placed a take-out order and sat twiddling my thumbs for 45 minutes. Others were waiting as long including people that were dining in. I couldn't figure out why the kitchen was working so frantically and nothing was coming out until I realized it was all going out the side door to be delivered. Cool that they use GrubHub but at least make sure it's not at the expense of people that come into the restaurant.\n\nSo edible but not if you have any urge to eat within the next hour.\n" u"Delivery came within an hour and my order was correct. The food wasn't worth it. I've had better Chinese food from mall food courts. The beef chow fun noodles were bland and the dumplings lacked any redeeming flavor. The pineapple fried rice was somewhat yummy but nothing here (not even the cheap price) is enough to bring me back.\n" u"Oh Capital Corner you never let me down.\n\nI'm sad to see all the 1 star reviews out there but I realize that different people have different tastes when it comes to Chinese food. Some like the americanized stuff some like authentic.\n\nI have to admit though I have only ever ordered one dish from this place the Sesame Chicken combo. But I have to tell you it's one of the tastiest sesame chickens I have ever had. And the portions are huge. I ordered the lunch combo today ( sesame chicken choice of rice and choice of soup or egg roll) and had food for both lunch and dinner! ($6.50) On other occasions I have ordered the dinner combo and have had enough food for three meals. ($7.50) This place is ridiculous.\n\nHowever I do agree with many people that their delivery and service need work. I do also know that many other popular take-out places in Ithaca take this long on delivery too.\n" u'The service is horrible I was yelled at over the phone when the delivery person refused to deliver to my home and wanted me to meet him on a busy street. The food was also terrible. Never order from here.\n' u'we order from her a lot food is always ready when they say it is and it is good. get the steamed dumplings\n' u"This is your average run of the mill chinese spot. Not to say it isn't great it's definitely a place i'll hit again for lunch when I only have options limited to the commons area but this is definitely not a place I go out of my way for. I liked the food the portion was good and the price for lunch was very very reasonable but it was just like other chinese place's I've been in the past.\n\nDefinitely a place to stop for lunch if your on the commons because while it's not great you won't be disappointed.\n" u'Capital Corner can be summarized is 4 words "mediocre Americanized Chinese food". There is nothing special on this menu to speak of. There are plenty of fried dishes that come in a generic gloppy/gelatinous sweet sauce. I honestly think 3 of these dishes the "Sesame chicken" the "Orange Chicken" and the "General Tso\'s Chicken" are actually the same dish with minor adjustments to garnishing. That being said there are no really good Chinese places in Ithaca (update: Spicy Aisan is actually very good the only one I order from any more) so I guess this place is as good as any when it comes to ordering take out. Personally I prefer to avoid Chinese food in this town and get my cravings satisfied when I travel elsewhere. \n\nThis all being said they are fast and attentive. My water glass never got below half way full. So there are some pluses to this place.\n' u"Wish I could give three and a half stars it's just not quite all the way to four. Delivery was quick and the food was hot. Portions are good size and everything was yummy. It's definitely Americanized Chinese food but compared to a lot of other takeout/delivery places in the same vein it's fresh and not greasy. Got crab rangoon and beef with snow peas. Would not hesitate to order again next time I'm in the mood for quick Chinese.\n" u"I'm Chinese and this is the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever had in my life. I have no problem with Americanized Chinese food and I do have Panda Express once in a while. The previously frozen food were not cooked throughly and the dishes we ordered were not fresh and tasteless. However I am guessing most of the positive reviews are from their sauce stir-fried meats from dinner combos. If you are unfortunately enough to be eating here do not be adventurous and order something that requires any Chinese food cooking knowledge.\n" u'I\'m surprised to see so many bad reviews here - I actually eat here maybe twice a month or so and I\'m never disappointed.  The service is lacking but sorry it\'s lacking at every Chinese place in Ithaca (except for my fave take-out only Ling Ling that woman is the sweetest!).  I pretty much have liked everything I\'ve gotten here.  I usually order the teriyaki chicken some dumplings and a sushi roll or two.  I like their all-you-can-eat lunch deal for when I\'m a little hungrier.\n\nAnyway I don\'t have tons to say about this place it\'s nothing fancy and like everything else around here yup it\'s "American" chinese food but for what it\'s worth I definitely like it more than some other reviewers here and do eat there fairly regularly as it\'s close to my office and it\'s a sure thing.\n' u"The first time we ordered from here we were impressed.  It was definitely Americanized Chinese food but it was fresh tasty and delivered fast.  The next time was slightly worse and delivery took a long time.  \n\nThis last time though was the reason we are giving them one star.  First they messed up my fianc\xe9's order and gave him a completely different kind of chicken dish.  I got the eggplant and it was soggy and not spicy at all (it didn't have any flavor).  The worst part though came at the end of the meal when we found bugs in the wonton soup.  It was absolutely disgusting and unacceptable.\n" u"The food isn't good enough to be worth a 90 minute delivery time. I called at the 60 minute mark and was told my food would be here in 10 minutes. I called at the 80 minute mark and was told it would be here in 2 minutes. I'm also 100% certain they're breaking child labor laws. There is a clearly unhappy child working their register. So delivery pick-up or sit-down you will have a bad experience ordering from Capital Corner.\n" u'Decent food takes a very long time (45-60min) and has a lazy delivery driver. Interesting that delivery implies I should meet you at your car.\n' u'It\'s a regular so-called \'Americanized Chinese food" restaurant. I\'m Asian but I\'m fine with it.\n' u'eh... Chinese takeout. An alright delivery value in Ithaca especially considering most of the thai food is glorified Chinese (delicious mostly but greasy) :) and is more expensive. But the woman who owns Capital Corner is so...angry! It\'s been my experience that whatever you ask her for you are almost guaranteed NOT to get. She has a certain sinister knowing look in her eyes that makes me think she is absolutely getting off on it. Is there a way to use reverse psychology on a person like this? "Could you make the soup EXTRA super mild?" might get her to actually put a spec of chili in it... hmmm\n\nIf you want better quality Chinese with fantastically friendly staff and can pick up order from Ling Ling\'s at the Northside Plaza (these people couldn\'t possibly be more sweet). Or drive to Tberg and go to Dragon Village. Both are FAR better quality and so so nice to deal with. \n\nHere you have to order selectively. I ordered their House Special soup and it was disgustingly gelatinous. Awful. I didn\'t even taste it because the thought of putting spoonfuls of salty bland  mucous into my mouth was too revolting.\n \nHaving said that everything else I have had here has been pretty ok. \n\nTheir Noodle Soup with Chinese Greens ($4.50 for the quart size!) with Udon noodles is very simple and actually quite great- by far my favorite thing on the menu. If you added a little sriracha sauce or garlic chili oil to give it a little flavor and heat it is even better.\n\nTheir Sesame Chicken is good. Could have been crispier... it hit the spot though.\n\nI also recommend their Dumplings. I have tried them all and they are good quality and very tasty. I like how they have vegetable and chicken not just pork (which is also delicious). I do not know what sauce they use but it is not just straight soy sauce. It is more balanced (sweeter less salty and lighter in color). It is not Ponzu either. Very nice.\n\nFinally there beef is not mystery beef and I love the fact that I can get brown rice. I have only seen that option at one other Chinese takeout place in all the cities I have lived (and Dragon Village). It adds such a great texture and nutty flavor. Much heartier and tastier than steamed white rice (also good here).\n\nOverall an ok value for the quantity and quality of the food in this town. But there is far better elsewhere.\n' u'I don\'t...I don\'t even know where to begin. When I rushed to my computer to rate this place I was shocked that there were any reviews above two stars. \n\nAnother reviewer generously called the place "mediocre Americanized Chinese food." I wish I ordered whatever he ordered because my food wasn\'t even mediocre. It was awful. I placed an order for General Tso\'s chicken. I received something lumpy covered in gelatinous sauce. I think it moved.\n\nAs I brought the jiggling lump to my mouth my brain and stomach agreed that a revolt was in order -- "WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THIS?!" they yelled. I didn\'t care; I ate it anyway. Who listens to their brain. In went the balls of goo and out went my wit and senses. What on earth did I consume? It wasn\'t flavorful no too chemical-y to be flavorful. It wasn\'t crisp as fried chicken covered in sweet salty sauce generally is. The receipt said General Tso\'s chicken but I could not fathom in which realm or world that this item could pass as the mighty General\'s fabled chicken. To be fair it was edible. I did manage to live long enough to write this review.\n\nIn my dreams that night General Tso kicked me in the shins and told me to get real.\n']
110.Vietnam Restaurant,[u"Not the best pho I've had but definitely the best pho you'll get in college town!! I think I prefer this over Saigon Kitchen - Saigon's pho tastes sweeter and slightly fragrant while here the broth is beefy and herbaceous! And for just $8 it's a STEAL!\n" u"Average pho nothing special. It'll satisfy a craving though. \n\nThe service was terrible. My friend and I waited fifteen minutes before we were served water and our orders were taken. We had to wave to our waiter to get his attention because the place was severely understaffed. There was only one other couple eating.\n\nThe bathroom is clean though! So I gave a star for that.\n" u"I had beef pho to go so I'm not going to comment on the noodles and meat since it's not that fair to judge it when it's been in a container for a while. But the broth...the broth was so incredibly bad. It was bland and so greasy. I tried to spice it up by adding the lime but the lime was so dry i couldnt get any juice out of it. Also they are not very generous with the bean sprouts. Basil leaves looked black and soggy so I had to pick them out. Overall it's just a bad meal could even eat half of it because the broth was too greasy.\n" u"Back in California my Vietnamese friends would always point out places which served mediocre pho by their standards. I never could tell what they meant because everything back home tastes pretty good to me.\n\nI don't have that issue in Ithaca. When it's bad pho it's apparent as soon as it arrives at your table. So if my standard of good is a Vietnamese person's standard of average that says a lot about the pho here.\n\nA bowl is probably gonna cost you around $10 before tip. Also unlike every other pho place I've seen every pho option here is priced differently. I'm used to seeing 5+ options (different combinations of beef provided) all priced the same so that you're essentially customizing what comes with your noodles with only the house special slightly higher (usually by just a dollar). Here the basic bowl is already $8 and the special is $11.\n\nI'm also used to being given an extra plate where they put all the bean sprouts limes and cilantro. At this place they'll just throw that into your bowl for you whether you want it or not. I normally don't put anything extra into the pho other than squeezing the lime. Speaking of which I couldn't even see the lime until most of my noodles were gone because the lime had sunk to the bottom of the bowl. The jalapeno was dropped in there too and made my soup much spicier than I would have liked.\n\nAnother weird thing - when I flipped over the container of hoisin sauce it flowed out so quickly and I wasn't even squeezing the bottle. I'm guessing that it's watered down.\n\nThe place was packed when I walked in so I thought they must be doing something right. Although I should have caught on to the pho being as bad as reputed since no one in the restaurant had pho in front of them. I guess the non-pho items on the menu are at least decent? I'm scared to find out though. I will say that the service is at least decent.\n\nIf you're craving pho do yourself a favor and go to Saigon Kitchen.\n" u"My friend say the rice with BBQ pork taste pretty good. However Pho is really bad doesn't taste like pho at all and even have seafood in it. Do not try Pho here you will be disappointed!\n" u"When I originally wrote this there was no Vietnamese restaurant in town but that has since changed. Saigon Kitchen is quite good so there's no reason to give this place your business if you're even remotely interested in Vietnamese food. Moreover the addition of a competitor in town hasn't improved anything here. \n\nIf you're just bad at cooking that's unfortunate but understandable. The people who run this place though refuse to so much as look at a pho recipe or visit another Vietnamese restaurant. There's genuinely no resemblance. That laziness shouldn't be rewarded.\n" u"I'm not a big pho person so the fact that their pho is somewhat awful is meaningless to me. The vermicelli with imperial meat roll (code word for ground greasy mystery meat rolled and deep fried full of fatty deliciousness) is the best item on the menu and if you order it you can really enjoy your meal but the pho just doesn't cut it.\n" u'The food here is just okay. The pho is not flavorful at all but the meat is super juicy and tender. The meat rolls (Vietnamese egg rolls) are fabulous and delicious! And the vermicelli is just okay. The service however was kind of lacking; the waitress herself was nice and attentive but one of the owners sat at one of the tables near me and was talking to someone on her cell phone in loud speaker yelling at them in Chinese and looking really unfriendly. While watching a movie or something on her laptop. Kind of put me off my eating experience because I was the only other person there and it made for a weird atmosphere to eat in.\n' u"I don't know why there's people saying the pho here is bad. I lived in VN for a year and I know what authentic pho tastes like. It tastes exactly the same as the one that I got from this place. Except that this place doesn't give you the little plate of mint and basil and jalape\xf1o.\n\nI was aware that the owner was Cantonese not vietnamese and doubted if the food would be good. Turned out it was good.\n\nFor people who loves Saigon kitchen I don't know why but my opinion is that their pho is really sweet or much sweeter than what i had almost everyday in vietnam. If you like that go for it. They do have better service and atmosphere there and thus the pricing is more reasonable. But I will come back to this place for the taste of the soup.\n" u'This place is venomous like that of the Inland Taipan but even that would have to take a backseat to this "viet" food. This stuff (noodles pork beef) is so bad that if you were to choose between eating here and starving you should default to starvation. If you were to graph your utility "eating here" on the x axis and "money" on the y axis your indifference curve would no longer be the aggrandized U shape economists adore but rather it would be horizontal for MU(x)=0. Absolutely no marginal utility. As for "viet" food this place is perhaps as real as emu is to turkey surimi to crab meat and chicken nuggets to... chicken. Just kidding the above are actually tolerable this is more like diet coke is to coke...absolutely disgusting and unforgivable.\n\nLastly a party of 5 will also automatically incur an 18% gratuity despite the absence of refilled water or any other service. If you are actually bringing 4 other people to eat here prepare to look for 4 new friends after dinner.\n' u"Wow.  It's astonishing that this place can call itself a Vietnamese restaurant let alone boldly name itself Vietnam Restaurant.  The food here is essentially mediocre Chinese food with Vietnamese-inspired names with quality positioned slightly above the stuff you find at a mall.  I mean come on a pho isn't supposed to be served with lettuce lemon and broad noodles.\n\nFor a more authentic Vietnamese experience at least go to Saigon Kitchen.  For better American-Chinese fare go to essentially any other Chinese restaurant in the city.\n" u'I ordered the vegetarian vermicelli and I really enjoyed it. The noodles were delicious and the vegetables were fresh! I would definitely go back.\n' u"Yum!\n\nI love this place. I've only ever really ordered the vermicelli (usually the one with beef AND pork rolls because I'm greedy) and the spring roll. The spring roll is nothing special but I do love their vermicelli. The meat is flavored really well and it's yummy and I love the sauce that you pour over the noodles. It's the same typical sauce you get at all Vietnamese restaurants though so can't rave about it too much.\n\nSeating is a bit crowded as they've tried to smush together as many tables as they could into a small narrow space.\n" u"Whenever I'd come here I'd order the meat roll vermicelli. I've also tried a variety of the dishes (usually off my friends'/family's plates) like the summer rolls (they call them spring rolls here even though all other spring rolls I've had were fried this one isn't) noodle soups chicken on rice and fried ice cream.\n\nTheir meat roll vermicelli is good but the sauce on the bottom gets to be too much towards the end. And since I'm not too much of a noodle person I'd just pick out the meat rolls halfway through the meal. The spring rolls are pretty standard and they contain a good portion of shrimp. Goes well with sriracha and the peanut sauce. The noodle soup was pretty good semi on the greasy side. The chicken is pretty standard nothing special about it but they marinaded it well and the chicken is never dry which is one of my bigger pet peeves with food.\n\nI've had the fried ice cream here. It was such a delight! I've never had before (and never had since) so I have nothing to compare it to.\n\nThe place tends to get full on the weekends (usually Sunday lunch) so be prepared to wait for a seat.\n" u'The location of this restaurant is perfect for college students. For what you are paying it is a great deal. Yes Saigon kitchen is better but it is a trek to get there and I have never been there when there wasn\'t a wait. The staff at Vietnam are very nice and the service is very efficient. I would say it is my "go to" restaurant in College Town.\n' u"Having just come back to the States after being in Vietnam for a few weeks I will admit it was definitely my mistake to come here in the first place.  But I just moved here from Boston (very consistently delicious Vietnamnese food) and figured I should waste no time in trying out my favorite meal options (um...why do you think I went to Vietnam in the first place?!) \n\nSadly though I was very disappointed.  Although I recognize that there is a serious lack of Vietnamnese options here in Ithaca (see:none) and that beggars can't really be choosers I don't know that I would choose to come back.  I ordered the Grilled Pork Vermacelli and it was... eh.  The vegetables and sauce and pork came to the table mixed together (as opposed to mixing the sauce in yourself) which I believe led to the mushiness of the noodles AND there were no peanuts (my favorite part!) They were very generous with the meat portion but it wasn't enough to make up for the overall lack of flavor.  To me though the biggest offense was the price-- almost $10 for a bowl of mediocre noodles?  Ridiculous.  I don't think I have ever paid more than $6 for a bowl of vermacelli.  \n\nNeedless to say I unless I am in a state of desperation I will not be coming back.\n" u'There was a time you\'d find me here for dinner at least once a week.  Take note that most of the low reviews here are from people with a different ideal for satisfying their pho craving...  \n\nThe food here is usually quick and it\'s tasty satisfying and reasonably priced. The owners are friendly.\n\nSpring rolls are good the vermicelli is delicious.  The restaurant is cozy but I like that they\'ll let you squeeze your group into their small space.  \n\nMaybe the food here isn\'t "authentic" whatever that means.  But hey you\'re in Ithaca!  You can still get a really good meal at Vietnam.\n' u'I\'ve eaten here at least a few times a month for over 10 years. It\'s definitely a favorite. Is it authentic Vietnamese food? I really can\'t say. But is it delicious?  Absolutely. And the staff are attentive and friendly and the service is very quick. I especially like the pork and shrimp vermicelli dishes and the pho with shrimp. Other people also seem to like the duck the pork chop and the steak cubes. Why 4 stars instead of 5? Atmosphere. It\'s okay but you don\'t walk in the door and go "wow! what a nice place!" It\'s a little spartan.\n' u"Great for Collegetown options.\n\nFood tastes good especially for being in collegetown. (I haven't had enough Vietnamese to comment any further.)\n\nService is very friendly.\n\nAtmosphere is good generally for Ithaca and fantastic for Collegetown. Simple and neither tacky nor gross.\n" u'The food was decent enough. Definitely edible but kind of bland. The service was excellent however and the atmosphere was very cozy and welcoming. Overall I might come again might not but I had a pleasant time and glad I experienced some Vietnamese cuisine.\n']
141.Hughes Dining,[u"Coffee RUB Burger is the best burger at Cornell. Hands down. Hands Down again. Keep them down. This is the shit that nobody has ever heard of either because they are too lazy to go down there to the law school or because they have never heard of it due to its relatively isolated location.\n\nWaffles are gigantic and you can get fruit with them too which is tasty. Breakfast sandwiches are nice too and relatively big for how much they cost. Eggs are great and everything tastes fresh even though it doesn't look the freshest.\n" u"This is really the only place on campus that does a high quality fast food style burger. The blue cheese burger with fried onion was absolutely fantastic. It might just be the best burger under $7 in all of Tompkins county. They also have very good BBQ entrees. The steak cut fries are just OK though. Unfortunately this gem of a location does not do much business and probably not enough to warrant the operational cost of such a massive kitchen. Unless a miracle happens Cornell's best kept secret will shut down soon. Eat here while its still open!\n" u"Eh. I was severely disappointed with how ordinary Hughes was. I was honestly expecting something really amazing but it was alright. The food is a bit too greasy for breakfast food and the waffles are a bit too much. A decent place to get food if you're too lazy to go far from collegetown for brunch.\n" u'This is the somewhat hidden a la carte dining hall in Cornell\'s law school building. I used to treat myself to breakfast here every week or two while I was there as an undergrad. Not only is it the best french toast I\'ve ever had Hughes Dining got me into rap. Every time I hear "What\'s the Difference" by Dr. Dre featuring Xzibit and Eminem I think fondly of Hughes.\n' u"the law school kids probably didn't like us undergrads raiding their dining hall but hughes dining is not-to-be-missed. i tend not to like pancakes but the chocolate chip pancakes there were so delicious. quality! sometimes i'd bring my little plastic container of pancakes to lecture and people would give me (or my pancakes) rapacious eyes. eyes and hands off!\n\nthey also had pretty great wraps and raps! you totally forget you're in the basement of the law school with the old school boombox blasting beats.\n" u"WOW. This is easily the greatest Big Red Bucks place in Cornell. Located on the Law School wall facing Collegetown a trip to this sweet little dining room will make you stagger out in the happiest way possible. There are two reviews on the breakfast already but it is the lunch here that got me addicted. The grill has the largest selection of any on campus and every single option is tasty tasty no lie. Mike the grill guy is awesome. He has a huge arsenal of rap and hip hop CDs each of which gets him hopping and cooking like a pro. The price is more than fair for each item as you get a lot of deliciousness for what you pay. The best deal is easily Dagwood's big brother a humongous sub loaded with meat for just $9. Eating this is its own experience. An attempt to finish it in one sitting attracts the attention of both Mike and the equally-entertaining cashier as they egg you on on your tough task. Overall a trip to Hughes is guaranteed to quench your hunger and it would be a huge error for any Cornellian not to come here.\n"]
88.Wings Over Ithaca,[u'THE BEST WINGS IVE EVER HAD!!! The wings are always fresh and warm and their boneless wings are SO AMAZING. Seriously lots of sauce and a ton of different flavors to choose from. Plus they are open till 3 AM on weekends.\n\n10/10 would recommend. you just gotta try this place out.\n' u"My favorite wings place I've ever been to! The wings are very meaty and you can tell the quality is solid. Also the flavor selection is awesome. Will definitely be a regular here!\n" u'Good food nice location and a great hangout spot! Be sure to get the waffle fries! The service was really quick as well for the amount of wings we got :)\n' u"Great service great location and most-importantly GREAT WINGS. The best in Ithaca. Words can't describe how happy I am to see this staple back and booming!\n" u"I can't believe these wings are back! They are absolutely delicious. The garlic parm and Cajun flavors are just as great as I remembered. This place looks fantastic and is now under new ownership. Check them out!\n" u"Get the Hangar 2!! I always get garlic parm and then mix it up for my sauced flavor (spicy teriyaki jamaican jerk bbq). Add an extra large blue cheese dip. Throw out the free celery and you've got yourself a nice dinner. :)\n"]
143.Casablanca Pizzeria,[u"They advertise themselves as the best pizza in the commons and I don't think it's a crazy claim to make.  Obviously that title depends on your taste and pizza preferences but I think it fits.\n\nThey make thin-crust pizza that is in my experience oven-baked with a more that average level of crispiness.  Not burned but not soft or greasy or doughy.  Their slices aren't by any means dry or stalebut find a sweet spot. \n\nI haven't tried anything but the pizza but it was good enough for a second round.  A friend recommends the buffalo chicken as well. \n\nThey definitely have a local welcoming feel.  You don't feel out of place here.  They're friendly. \n\nSome good slice + soda deals for $5-6.  Great for lunch or dinner.\n" u'The pizzas here are not that great . They are often cold. But typically their pizzas are always ready and there is very less or no wait time. The tiramisu here is not good at all . The shawarma was too dry and served cold. Overall not a great place to eat but decent for a quick pizza slice.\n' u"Slices with a side of staple. \n\nI went and picked up some pizza to go for my boyfriend and I. Halfway through one slice my boyfriend found a staple with his mouth. I hope I don't have to stress how dangerous a staple could have been if ingested and he is lucky that he didn't cut his mouth or swallow it. \n\nI immediately called Casablanca to let them know and while the people I interacted with seemed nice their manager never returned my call and I don't think there is much that they can do to retain my business after this incident. \n\nWhen I first called the person working the phone line was apologetic took my information and said the manager would call me. 30 minutes later I got a call from a delivery person saying he had a pizza for me. I was confused. We hadn't ordered a new pizza and didn't want one. I ended up feeling bad for the delivery personwho at first thought this was a normal delivery and didn't understand why it was being refused. \n\nI called Casablanca back and spoke to the same guy I spoke to originally telling him I refused delivery. He relayed a message to me from the manager apologizing and offering a 20% discount. He also let me know they had thrown away the remainder of the pie that my slice had come from. \n\nI recognize that there isn't much that they can do other than what they did. They tried to make amends. But I would have appreciated a call from the manager rather than a surprise pizza delivery. \n\nI hope that they keep their staples ( I guess from take out orders?) and food prep separate in the future.\n" u"I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews. This place was much better than the 2.5 average rating it currently has. I'm giving it 4 stars as my own brand of vigilante justice to balance out the haters. (It's a solid 3 star place.)\n\nFellow reviewers have you not been into a pizza place before?? This place was not dirtier than the majority of pizza places I have visited. It's probably comparable to the cleanliness of other fast food places. The place isn't falling down but sometimes you're going to have to brush crumbs off your table. \n\nThe service was so good and friendly and the prices were let's face it very cheap. That said the speciality pizza slices were actually pretty tasty! The owner (?) recommended the eggplant parm pizza and it was fabulous. The drink that came with the meal was very small but it's a bargain so what can you expect? One negative comment I will admit is that I was DYING of thirst later in the day--the salt content of the food was probably pretty high. \n\nSo a great place to grab an affordable and tasty slice.\n" u'Stopped here after walking around Cornell campus.  Ordered the lunch special-gyro and fries for 7.99.  There was plenty of sauce fries were crisp and meat tasted fresh.  I was stuffed afterwards. Staff was very friendly too.   Next time I would like to try the pizza!  It looked really good!\n' u"Not clean. The food does not taste fresh. Flies roam around the eatery. Even though the guys behind the counter make an effort to welcome me. It does not cut it for me since the place made me lose my appetite. \n\nI noticed not many people come in here. The place look  deserted. When I came here I saw a couple of people enter and an order a soda or fries. \n\nThe soft drinks tasted watered down and very unsavory. The grilled vegetable tasted a bit bland.  \n\nI wouldn't bring a date here or anyone for that matter. This will be the last stop to eat if I had no choice.\n" u"Great music. Great staff. Good food.\n\nPlace has nice small atmosphere. It fits in well with the area. The staff was very kind to me and even though they charge for refills let me have mine for free. Don't know why they just seemed genuinely kind. \n\nFood was good. I always love me a calzone but they have a WIDE selection of calzones and Stromboli that aren't OMG great but very good.\n\nI'd recommended trying this place out. Not like you need to get here ASAP but if you're ever in the area give it a try.\n" u"Best tasting thin crust pizza in Ithaca. Always packed after a night out in the commons. Doesn't look like the nicest place but the pizza makes up for it.\n" u'I love this place.\n\nVery affordable and they have a wide selection of food choices too. \n\nI recommend the shrimp scampi pasta or the gyro cheeseburger. \n\nThe people here are all cool and friendly too.\n\nAgain would recommend this place to anyone :)\n' u"So I'm going to put it out there and say this isn't the kind of place I would really take someone for lunch...or well readily admit to going to myself. This is Yelp though so I'll put my thoughts out there. \n\nThe reality is that it's not the most uh appetizing place. It's not especially clean the pizzas don't always look especially good and the seating tends to be wobbly or be covered in crumbs. Oh and the flies...I've seen so so many flies. That said I worked a block from the Commons for some time and I could easily wander over here for lunch with coworkers or something when we needed a quick bite. \n\nThe guys who work in the place have always been super welcoming but they definitely don't seem to put a lot of effort into keeping the place clean.\n\nIf you're looking for fresh food this is not the place for you. This is the place for you if you need something to eat and you're already down on or near the Commons. It's a place of convenience that happens to have a tasty thing or two on the menu (though I've tried various things I usually order the gyro...which is fine but not anything more than that) or you can get a couple slices of pizza when you're in need of a quick bite.\n" u'Del was extremely helpful this week when we had to place a catering order a day before for a event. He provided us more than enough food for a discounted price. Everyone loved the food. Will be sure to order from Casablanca next time!\n' u"I first came here about two months ago when I moved to Ithaca and after I would probably say I have been here 5 more times and I had take out from here twice. \n\nHonestly I'm not sure why so much negative reviews for this place. I actually love eating here. When you first walk in it looks a little run down the guys working look like their in the mob. You know things look a little sketchy ... But talking to the guys and owner you would come to find out these are hard working guys. Very nice and great customer service. I have always felt welcome when I come here.. \n\n\nThe food is really good ... If you give it a try you would see.. This is actually my TOP FAV pizza place in ithaca ... The pizza is typical pizza you would get if you walk into a pizza shop in the Bronx ... It's rather good .. The calzone is okay I mean the first time and last time I had one was in Italy so you can't really compare lol but it was decent really big enough for two people unless your really hungry. \n\n\nOver all I wish people would give this place a try it's really not that bad.\n" u'Inexpensive tasty pizza friendly folks. The falafel was yummy on the spicy side good tzatziki sauce fresh pita. Served with fries which they claim are the "best in Ithaca". They were fresh & hot however they are the crispy coated batter kind - not my thing. Wish there were cucumbers on the pita. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant was hot & unappealing so we ate out on the commons.\n' u'Great food and quality. Very nice staff and atmosphere! Will come back soon for more. The best pizza in Ithaca.\n' u'First of all this place is not closed.   Yep shows it closed in a Saturday afternoon. Right on the Main Street with shops.  Pizza by the slide with good options eggplant toppings traditional  chicken parmigiana.   Gyros etc.  we had pizza by slice and it was good.  Place is clean and fast.\n' u'The past couple of times we have gone there the Pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom and had a burnt taste too. However the staff were very nice and friendly. We are going to try them again despite our burnt pizza experiences because we went there often over the summer and always had great tasting food so we do believe that the past two times could have been a fluke and that they deserve another chance.\n' u"Reallyyyy weak pizza I'm not picky at all and I thought their pizza sucked. Would not recommend at all.\n" u"The only reason I came here is because it's directly across the street from my friend's apartment in the Commons. We were having a group dinner but we were waiting for some other friends to finish cooking which would take at least another hour or so and I was starving so I decided to run downstairs and get something quick that wouldn't fill me up.\n\nYou see the typical pizza options here in their display. Pizza quality here is lower than what you can get in other places around Ithaca. It's marginally cheaper per slice here but the extra quarters elsewhere are worth it.\n\nThe place itself is just disgusting. They have so many flies just hanging around inside their pizza display case and they make no effort to do anything about it. The tables are really dingy several were left uncleaned and you'll have flies bothering you while you eat too.\n" u'There\'s going to be a lot of people here complaining about the look and atmosphere of this place. Clearly this is not a place you make an occasion out of. It\'s "I really want some pizza stat!" This is my go to place for delivery pizza. And when I\'m around the commons and want a cheap lunch.\n' u'I stopped by here for lunch with my daughter because we happened to be in the Commons area and hungry for a quick bite. We avoided the pizza because there was a fly buzzing around and landing on all the slices and it didn\'t look very appetizing. So we ordered from the "specials" they have posted on the front glass of the pizza station: a cheeseburger and a gyro.\n\nThe food was actually pretty good but it took a long time. They are set up to sling pizza quickly but ordering anything else off their menu seems to take a while. The fries were nice and hot and everything was made well. The guy working the counter was very polite and nice and thanked me for waiting.\n\nThe restaurant itself is dirty almost to the point of being disgusting so I\'m a bit torn about my overall rating. For the food and friendliness I would easily give three stars. But if you feel gross just sitting down to eat the experience is somewhat lessened. They do clean the tables but the rest of the place needs a powerwashing. \n\nI imagine that if you\'re drunk at 2am looking for a slice you\'ll overlook the condition of the restaurant...\n']

159.Razorback BBQ,[u'Razorback is essentially the "food" side of The Haunt a divey bar/mini-venue.  Speaking strictly about the food it\'s decent but inconsistent.  The smoked wings are probably the best thing here.  They\'re still finished in a fryer like typical wings so they have a bit of crunch but the smokiness adds an interesting dimension that you don\'t normally find elsewhere.  But yeah don\'t expect that consistency to stay...well consistent.  The texture comes out differently almost every time even between batches.\n\nThe same goes for the ribs.  They\'re typically well made (for Ithaca) but wildly inconsistent and sometimes even lukewarm/cool.  My guess is that they whip up a bunch of their food items and leave them to warm in the back.  Just a guess.\n' u'We were looking for some barbeque before leaving Elmira. it was close to where we were and had a 3 1/2 start rating.  The fact that it is called a restaurant is misleading. \n\nWe asked our waitress to wash our sticky table.   The table was even stickier after she washed it.   Half of the menu was dedicated to their smoked wings which the were out of at 6:30 pm.  Seriously. \nThis may be a great bar but DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.\nI gave them a single star but we left without ordering. Two sticky tables and specials that were out at 6:30 we enough for us!!\n' u"Went back for the ribs. They were pretty mediocre which was disappointing since I was really hoping to find decent ribs in Ithaca. My friend had the El Diablo burger which she also said was mediocre. This time there was a band playing so loud that I could barely hear my friend speak. They were pretty decent however. Still this place has character and the patio looks like a nice place to sit outside during the summer so I can't bring myself to give less than a 3.\n" u"The music can get loud and make sure to call them before going if you want ribs because there are days they don't have them.\n\nWith that said those are the only complaints I have. The outside patio is fun to hang out on the wings are excellent (get them smoked you won't be disappointed!) The ribs weren't as saucy as I prefer but still excellent.  Considering it's about the ONLY bbq in Ithaca it's not a stretch to say it's easily the best.\n" u'We\'d intended to check out the BBQ menu that\'s been part of the local music venue The Haunt since April \'09. I\'m glad we did. While they weren\'t doing a lot of dining business (most of the patrons were at the bar at 6:30 pm on a Tuesday) we ordered wings and found them delicious. The smoked wings which we chose with Razorback\'s "original" house sauce were meaty crispy-skinned and generously-coated with a sweet and smoky sauce. The medium Buffalo-style wings which we didn\'t order smoked were slightly smaller but also quite good crisp-skinned as well (not breaded and coated the way some places do wings). Both styles came served with a few celery sticks and a standard small container of blue cheese dip full of chunks of blue cheese though we only dipped the Buffalo wings in the blue cheese. I will definitely stop by again -- I am curious about their ribs now (I understand Thursday is "rib night" there).\n']

120.Sinfully Delicious Baking Co.,[u"So impressed with the cake!!! We requested a low sugar lactose free cake and it was wonderful! Racquel uses naturally lower in sugar ingredients and substituted coconut milk for regular milk. Vanilla cake and lemon filling was delicious and didn't taste at all like an alternate option it was actually up there with the best cakes I've had. Everyone was so impressed by the taste and the look. It looked very professional. She also was happy to arrange a simple and convenient pickup and was so nice! We'll definitely be buying from here again!!!\n" u"Amazing!  We were in Ithaca for my husband's birthday wknd and ordered a cake from Racquel. She was extremely helpful and accommodating.  There's a huge selection of cake/frosting combinations and everything is customizable. \n\nWe ended up with an organic chocolate cake with salted caramel butter cream - delivered straight to the restaurant. It was a huge hit with everyone.  Delicious and beautifully decorated!\n\nIf we're ever back in town I will definitely be ordering another cake!\n" u'Simply amazing!! Racquel provided desserts for my wedding of 160+ Cakes pies brownies and lemon bars everything was absolutely delicious AND beautiful.  She worked with us to provide exactly what we were looking for and everyone raved about the dessert.  Great way to end the evening!\n' u'Just want to thank Raquel for a beautiful cake!   She took alot of time with me and made a gorgeous cake for my daughters birthday.  We are far away and knowing we could have it delivered was a big plus!   Raquel herself delivered the cake!  Wonderful experience!\n' u'Sinfully Delicious Baking Co. Is an outstanding bakery that creates a wide variety of goods to please your palette. Using less sugar and only the finest freshest ingredients the owner. RACQUEL RICCARDI is able to custom craft an order to your specific needs and/or tastes. My most recent purchases were a lemon meringue pie and a pecan hazelnut chocolate poached pear tart. Besides being gorgeous they were incredibly tasty and huge crowd pleasers. Indulge yourself.\n' u"Racquel is amazing! My boyfriend and I have ordered a few things from her and loved everything from the gluten-free carrot cake to the regular (with gluten) Boston cream pie cake! We've also tried a lot of her brownies cupcakes pies creme brulee etc. at local breweries and restaurants and everything is delicious and healthier than most alternatives because of her careful use of ingredients. I can't recommend Sinfully Delicious highly enough.\n"]
181.Papa John‚Äôs Pizza,[u"Don't eat pizza much. Forgot how good Papa John's pizza and wings are. Really good soft dough flavor. Gonna come back more often. Staff friendly too.\n" u"This is the worst Papa John's I've ever had to deal with in my entire life. I made a phone order and changed my mind literally a minute later and the manager was extremely rude to me. It was the worst customer service I have ever seen in my entire life. I will not be ordering from this Papa John's location for a while. This was the March 5th nightshift manager.\n" u'Preordered a single pizza to be delivered one hour ahead of when I wanted it called the store when it was 20 minutes late and was assured that it would arrive momentarily. One hour later and still nothing had shown up. Called the restaurant to check on the status and the employee was unable to update my order or give me a clear estimate on the time that it would arrive. Do not order from here.\n' u'This place is great because you can go online and find all sorts of Papa John\'s coupons to get free stuff. You can almost always get free cheese bread which is basically an entire cheese pizza. Every time I go in there they look at me like "Oh great here\'s that guy again who\'s always ripping us off for free food."if you\'re going to go with one of the big-box pizza retailers this is the one to go to in Ithaca.\n' u'Tastes like fake ingredients to me.  All around kinda gross.  Not a fan.\n' u'Very expensive and not good pizza. The crust is undercooked too soft and obviously full of weird dough-softening chemicals. The pizza just tastes awful and you pay quite a bit for it too.\n']
58.Taste of Thai,[u'Though Thai restaurants rarely reach my standards for a satisfying dining experience I truly enjoyed the service and food at Taste of Thai on February 24 2017.\n\nI was hesitant about what to order and aimed for something light so the server walked me through the menu highlighting what he considered good options. He did not rush me to make a decision but waited till I was ready to order.\n\nThe food oyster sauce stir-fried broccoli had amazing flavors. The crunchiness of shrimp and the freshness of baby corn lit up my palate.\n\nIf you want to try out a decent Thai restaurant in Ithaca Taste of Thai should be your top choice. I definitely recommend lighter dishes because of the diverse flavor and ease on digestion. But I also heard that the heavier dishes are very genuine so I will make another trip for them next time.\n' u'The attentive and friendly staff were great and food was good. We realized after we left (by looking on Yelp) that they automatically added 18% gratuity to our bill which wasn\'t apparent to us at the time even though we always review checks before paying. We of course left a tip for our $50 bill. \n\nPad Thai was good. Emerald curry was yummy though the portion was smaller than expected. I did enjoy the $5 "Thai Bloody and Spicy" bar special they had going on - basically a Bloody Mary. We had a red curry that was just decent. Their bathroom needs a lot of work to the point of being almost unappetizing which I\'m sure they know as they have a sign that said they were under construction and to please excuse their appearance. I would go back when in town but be careful of the automatically charged gratuity. Maybe just for take out.\n' u"Came here around 7pm on a weekend. It wasn't crowded. My water cup had 2 black specs... horrible! \n\nWe ordered the quail for our appetizer and the following entrees: pineapple fried rice frog legs pad see ew and the fish curry. Only thing I enjoyed was the fish curry. Everything else was either too oily rubbery soggy or overcooked.\n\nI also asked for VERY spicy for all dishes and the only dish that they got correct was the fish curry.\n\nAlso maybe this is typical of NY but they automatically charged 18% gratuity... and we were only a party of 3! In CA an 18% gratuity is only warranted for parties of 6 or more. Not sure what warranted this 18% charge. Plus service was mediocre. I had to ask twice for more water. When we finished our food and were waiting for the check they kept refilling our water... thanks but no thanks. I had to tell her to stop bc I didn't want to waste water!\n\nWould not return. I'm sure there's better Thai food in Ithaca--if not I'll have to open my own shop.\n" u"We were on Seneca trip and decided to visit my bff's daughter who was moving in to Ithaca College for her 2nd year on same weekend. As a college student Ithaca Commons is their normal food trip route. As she suggested we dined in to this place.\n\n It was packed when we walked in. Luckily we got seats right away to think it was a move-in weekend. I am not a newbie to Thai foods actually I find Thai cuisine the best based on my past dining experiences. As we walked the place was not appealing to me. \n\nOur waitress was nice. She gave us more time since we were a little undecided of how we want to do it.  She gave us suggestions and informed us for how many people each order can serve.  I like it when she said that I could change the spiciness of what I have order into mild  flavor only. \n\nWe sampled some of their famous cuisine- the tamarind duck soup the pad  thai their pineapple friend rice koi kua ( noodle with scallion lettuce eggs chicken and squid)  pra lam long son( meat with spinach and their peanut sauce)  & panang (meat with basil leaves bell pepper with their curry paste and coconut cream).  It took a while before our food was serve.\n\nFor me based on the samples from our order that I have tasted  there was nothing that spectacular. It's an OK pretty standard taste. I have tasted better prior dining. I  am from Queens NY and it is a county that has the  most diverse restaurants. \n\nWhen total bill arrived it was somewhat more than I was expecting.\n" u'Compared with other Thai food available in Ithaca this place earns a giant yawn from me and a recommendation that you take your business elsewhere.\n\nWhat it does have going for it is that it\'s in a convenient spot on the commons and didn\'t seem too busy at least at lunchtime on a weekend. So if you\'re roaming around down there and just have to have some basic Thai food right then you might go in and take a gamble.\n\nThey have your typical Thai selection including curries Thai fried rice soups and of course the venerable pad thai. They ask how spicy you want the curry and even after a warning from the server that the highest number was quite spicy it was not at all spicy. Just laughable. If you want spicy Thai food you won\'t get it here. You can\'t even ask for the pad thai to be made spicy but she offered to bring out a "spice tray" which never materialized. Not too impressed there.\n\nThe food is decently palatable but not very flavorful or spicy. That will be my first and only visit.\n' u'Massaman Curry is soooo good! Tho a bit salty.\nService was a bit slow due to the busy hour.\n' u"I came  here around 6:00 in the evening for dinner. We weren't greeted for 10 minutes waiting around (which then we should have left). Anyways things get way worse! The female servers there act if there shit doesn't stink. No personality or any type of friendly bone in their body. The food was terribly overly salted and poor quality \n. What a disappointment this place was. I would never recommend this place to anyone.\n" u"Started off with squab appetizer... really good! Savory minced pork soup delicious.\n\nThe outstanding pineapple curry with duck was recommended by our server Eden... who by the way was one of the best servers I've had in a long time. Eden was patient friendly and very informative. Waxahatchee is the band Eden!\n\nFinished with sticky mango rice desert... delicious!\n" u'We got the yellow curry fried rice and the green curry (with jasmine rice). Both were fantastic and really enjoyable to eat. \nTaste of Thai never fail to give you a highly satisfying meal  in portion size service and taste!\n' u'Solid Thai restaurant that offers all the usual favorites at other Thai restaurants but some new items including a creamy Tom Yum (who knew?) Prawn Sarong (shrimp wrapped in ramen) and a fairly large menu of many different possibilities. I was also surprised by their dessert menu which included everything from sticky rice and mango to fried ice cream and some sort of vegan chocolate cake. I would have to say that the best part of the meal was the soup and if it was especially chilly outside I might come back just for a pot/cauldron of something.\n' u"Terrific Thai place out of a choice of several in Ithaca. But this is the only one that has the tiny Thai eggplants in the vegetable dishes. A unique flavor you won't get anywhere else.\n" u"So I assumed I had been to this place before but the other location - I was wrong. I have never been to either location so this is my first impression.\n\nThe hostess was kind of a ditz. \nIt was crowded at the door with open seats but still having to wait for 15 minutes for a table. We sat at the bar instead not a lot of room but it was fine we just wanted to eat. The bartender took our orders nice guy.\n\nI ordered Som Tom as an appetizer I am not a huge fan of spicy food but I like some spice to that meal and it was pretty easy to eat. Tasted good but it didn't really hit the spot for me. I feel like something was missing from it but I couldn't quite tell what it was. The thing that irritated me about this was he brought me my appetizer and said oh your meal is ready too but i'll wait until hers comes out (a friend who I went there with). So my food sat there waiting.\n\nFinally we had our meals. Pad See Ew my go to. Again good but nothing special that blew me away. I ordered mango and sticky rice and it took 10 minutes for us to get it. We sat there and wanted our checks to leave by the time it came out. I think this place is good for the college students and it is easily accessible. If it's winter they prop the door open and it can get really cold. Not smart. I would suggest going to Thai Basil instead but that is my opinion. The food was good but nothing memorable.\n" u'While my first experience at Taste of Thai was a pleasant experience my most recent experience was not.\n\nThere was an issue with the restroom so the front of the restaurant smelled like sewage. Despite this they tried to seat is right outside the bathroom. We asked to be moved and they accommodated (though the smell permeated slightly). \n\nWaiters were not assigned to tables so service was horrific. We were never checked on glasses went empty throughout dinner and while we wanted to request hot sauce (because food was not spiced as requested) we could not.\n\nThe papaya salad tasted like artificial lemon juice.\n' u'I am writing the review while I am in the restaurant though I love the place I am having a really bad experience. When I first arrived the first thing they told us we should be back in an hour then they realized it will be 10 minutes. So we were happy and waited for the 10 minutes to be seated. After that we were waiting for the waiter to come and take the order. It took them around 20 minutes to send someone to take the order though we asked several times. I order Banang Curry and then they brought a wrong order. I was with my husband and we ended up eating separately. \nWhile we were waiting for the Banang curry to come another waiter brought us the check.\nThis was a very bad experience for me I do not think I will go there again!\n' u"Good food if you are a college student craving some ethnic Thai food. The place brings every dish out at once so I don't recommend ordering a soup :-) \n\nSpicy Thai Chicken is a dish I recommend. Penang curry is not bad either\n" u"Food was good and perfectly sized! I got the roasted duck tamarind which was tender and balanced between notes of sweet and savory just the way I liked. Highly recommend their Tom Kha soup coconut milk broth with lemongrass: SO flavorful. Also tried a pi\xf1a colada mocktail: pretty good but also really sweet and sadly could not finish it. A friend had the orange chicken and said it was good though their was a lot of fried dough. Service can be quite slow but with a big group we had good company and didn't mind too much\n" u'I would give zero stars if I could. If you want cold overly sweet Thai food (literally pad Thai with maple syrup) and Thai iced tea with half and half this is this place. If you want sour papaya salad bingo. Pad se ew with 5 countable strands of noodles you got it. When I brought this up to the manager/owner he said "sweetie this is not New York City". Oh and automatic 18% gratuity is added to the bill even if you\'re 2 or 3 people. Great. \n\nPlease do yourself and humankind a favor and do not eat here. Wouldn\'t even take my leftovers and give it to a homeless person.\n' u"Our best vegan meal in Ithaca. They are flexible with most of their dishes willing to veganize... tweaked my favorite dish Pad see ew to make it vegan adding tofu and removing the egg. The curry that my wife got was excellent too. We'll be back next time we're in town!\n" u"I went back on Tuesday it was kind of quiet at 2 pm they changed lunch menu and not sell Rad Na anymore. (Pad see u with lots of gravy on top.) So I skipped that and ordered drunken noodle with beef instead. Food prepared was way better than last visit in February. Beef pieces look better bigger and overall preparation look colorful and healthy. But seems like they change chef and serving style and management team. \n\nAnd for the taste it's not best as last year and not worst as last visit too. Kind of in between so I give them 3 star. But in the future I would have lunch at Hai Hong Collegetown better because the taste is better and they still serve Rad Na my most favorite ever. :) But for lunch choice in town I like the Uncle Hot Dog Food truck in Common . :)\n" u"Defiantly worthy of a 5 star review. The location is perfect for a night out. Right in the heart of Ithaca. The atmosphere is one that communicates a fine dining experience. As I entered I was greeted by wonderful staff who showed me to a very comfortable seat. Overall very friendly and organized staff worthy of work at such a fine establishment. The waiter was very attentive and friendly. I was giving great suggestions on appatizers and a main course. Now I will move on to the food. The dishes I was served were absolutely delicious. I ordered the yellow curry while a friend ordered the Thai Fried Rice. The food came out quickly and right off the bat looked delicious. But when I tasted it I knew this would be my favorite Thai place in Ithaca. The curry was delicious and the rice that was served was wonderful a perfect combo and an amazing meal. I did try my friends Thai Fried Rice and the taste was amazing. A perfect balance of flavors. As we payed I ended up seeing the manager. I thanked him and another great experience as he is a very friendly man who is clearly excellent at his job. Couldn't be happier.\n"]
113.Ned‚Äôs Pizza,[u"A delicious pizza with very friendly staff. The crust is a tasty and crisp but still not overcooked on the inside. The ratio of crust to sauce to toppings is perfect. You can never go wrong with a slice from here. As well the other good served is worth price and being the it's relatively cheap price for the high quality food your getting it's absolutely worth it.\n" u'I ordered take-out from Ned\'s Pizza on Sunday 08-21-16 after scanning online for the nearest pizza places. The website was outdated (no online ordering) but still functional so I decided to order Special #9 (18" cheese 10 wings 2-liter extra toppings $2.25 each). The young guy on the phone was knowledgeable and efficient at taking my order and stated that 1-topping could be half-pepperoni and half-pineapple so I went with that.\n\nWhen I arrived to pick up my order an older gentleman was running the register. He looked like he hadn\'t showered or generally cared about basic human hygiene. When I told him I ordered Special #9 he rudely said they didn\'t have that only to be corrected by one of the younger employees in the back. He then proceeded to randomly charge me $26.99 (tax included) since he clearly didn\'t know that such special existed. I tried calculating how he arrived at that price with regular menu prices but couldn\'t so I do not know how he did it. My meal should\'ve only cost me $24.02 ($19.99 + $2.25 + 8% tax) but I knew mentioning this mistake would only further upset and confuse the incompetent and senile cashier.\n\nLastly when I signed my credit card but didn\'t leave a tip my girlfriend later told me that the cashier openly sighed and shot us a look a disappointment as if he deserved a tip for taking 30 seconds to overcharge us 12% on our meal.\n\nBottom Line: Calculate your total before you pay and make sure this guy doesn\'t overcharge you. I will never go back even though the food was good due to the extremely poor impression I received from the cashier.\n' u"Got dough from this pizzaria for a homemade-style pizza recipe and the dough could not have been more perfect! We were worried that the dough might not have tasted right because we're from NYC but we will be back for more because it was fantastic!\n" u"Awesome pizza but don't be fooled by the open until 9pm advertisement. Stopped in for a slice a little after 8pm and was not treated very well. The guy made me feel like I should not have gone in and I was bothering him. He reluctantly gave me a slice.\n" u'Dropped in after a flight to Ithaca. Excellent slice of pizza. Was very pleased. Friendly staff as well but that pizza wow. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who wants to buy a few slices or a sandwich.\n' u"We ordered food from here when we were staying at a hotel nearby. We originally wanted to get delivery but had to opt for pick-up. Here is why. Although they say they deliver when we called (from very close by) they said they didn't deliver on Sundays then they implied that they only deliver to Cornell. However when pressed because we were even closer to them than Cornell the person who answered the phone said that the owner does the deliveries and when the owner decides not to come in there are no deliveries. We got the impression this happens randomly likely every week. I find this a tad bit lazy (just hire a delivery driver!) and also misleading. If your website says you deliver you should deliver! This is why they get three stars and not higher.\n\nThe food however (once we picked it up) was really good! We got a pizza with extra cheese a side salad and chicken tenders. Everything was cooked well. The pizza cheese sauce and crust were so delicious. The chicken tenders had a light breading and the chicken was not overcooked (a problem I've had at other places). The salad was fresh but nothing amazing.\n\nOverall I might order from here again if we were close by but not if we wanted delivery.\n" u"The staff was very nice but unfortunately the Pizza was not good think it's the crust just not good sorry.\n" u"Very good! The pizza is tasty with a great crust and fresh toppings. We tried a margarita pizza and it was very well made with fresh cheeses and sliced tomato. We also tried the hot wings and I thought they were quite good. They are a little dry but I thought they went well with the celery and dipping sauce. They were probably mild-to-medium not hot even though I ordered the hottest available.\n\nI really dug the owner. He's quite friendly and interesting to talk to if he's not too busy. I did takeout for my order but I saw two delivery vehicles in the parking lot so that should be an option if you don't want to deal with the Hanshaw construction nightmare.\n" u"Very upset with my experience here! Called from a nearby hotel and 1) was denied delivery. 2) messed up my order for PLAIN pasta (put cheese on- i'm lactose intolerant and vegan) 3) wouldn't answer their phone when i called at 8:30 from the hotel to let know of the order mix up 4) finally got order switched (but with no refund) and a pissed off attitude from the server when we came to tell him he messed up the order 5) noticed there were 5 workers and no customers yet they still decided to not pick up a ringing phone. Will not be coming back.\n" u"Ned's is fantastic. Very clean fine quality of food quick service. Ned has a great team of workers who keep the food flying out.\n\nI work next door to Ned's and have become well acquainted; I eat there at least twice a week every week. They're totally consistent! I am totally hooked on the crust! When I have my grandson with me they cut the pizza into little pieces for him. \n\nLove it!\n" u'Ned seems like a pretty cool guy--he answered the phone and took our order for take-out. We got there about six minutes after the time he quoted us. "You\'re late!" he teased...or maybe he wasn\'t teasing? It was dead-pan but we took it well.\n\nSince we took it to go I can\'t comment much on anything else but the pizza itself: damn good NYC style pizza that left us wishing we had ordered a second pie just so we could taste more of it. We got a basic cheese and it was absolutely perfect.\n\nJust y\'know don\'t keep Ned waiting. The food\'s worth burning the roof of your mouth on scalding hot cheese for.\n' u"This is one of my most fav pizza house so far in Ithaca I feel like I lived here long time but just discovered this place by accident. But very impressed in the end.\n\nI like their pizza they are really paid attention to make pizza you can see and tell from the ingredient and how well their prepared.\n\nI like all kind of pizza sphaghetti chicken wings and gyoros are what I recommended.\n\nAll staffs are very nice cool and friendly. So far I went back and recommended to everyone.\n\nI try to ordered for take out one time but they did not do take out then we had to droved to pick up instead but we're fine with that. Yummie!!\n" u'Love the neighborhood vibe full of local families.  The pizza is really variable sometimes it is 4 star and sometimes it is 2 stars. I feel like it is a pizza lottery.\n' u'NY Pizzeria is truly life changing but if you don\'t want to go al the way to Trumansburg Neds is the best pizza in Ithaca by far. Tastes the most like a real NY slice. Decent middle eastern bites as well. Only thing wrong with Neds is that when they get too busy they simply don\'t pick up the phone. Maybe get an answering machine - just out of politeness - that says "we\'re not taking orders at the moment sorry for the inconvenience!"\n' u"This is my favorite pizza place. The pizza selection is large for walk-in orders. Slices are reheated in the oven and develop a nice crunchy crust as a result. Even if you get the last slice of a pizza that has been out for a while it tastes really great. Of course super fresh slices are a lot better. Price is not bad. 2 cheese slices and a drink is $4.50 and 2 specialty slices and a drink is $5.50. There is seating for those that want to eat-in. Tables are always clean and there are a decent number of them. As far as the pizza goes the fresh taste paired with the crisp crust make Ned's my favorite pizza place. The owner is also a super charismatic man that makes your whole experience a little bit brighter!!\n" u"I agree with other reviewers - you'll love the atmosphere and staff. Ned is extremely friendly and everyone works really hard. The pizza is good and I would recommend trying the buffalo chicken salad or a chicken Caesar salad - both are excellent and healthy!\n" u"The pizza is very good it has a nicely charred thin crust and the toppings are quite fresh. They also have many good deals all day long including 2 cheese slices 6 wings and a soda for $7 make them gourmet slices for $8 or ditch the wings for $5. I would highly recommend them for lunch but for dinner their slices get kind of stale. Their wings are also not very good dry and tough as far as wings are concerned.\n\nA lot of my lady friends go here after they get their hair done at the salon next door. I guess nothing goes with a classy hairdo like a slice of greasy pizza and a coke ;). What a day of indulgence right forget the spa go to Ned's.\n" u"I am a pizza kind of guy. Love pizza. I have even had pizza in Naples Italy! \nNed's Pizza is the best tasting pizza in Ithaca. I have tried just about all other places. Great crust wide selection and reasonable pricing.\n" u"Closest thing to NYC pizza in Ithaca. It's a cute place for lunch w great hot subs and specials.\n" u"I stopped in after seeing Ned's on Yelp. I can imagine that Ned's has the best pizza in Ithica but if you are not from Ithica you might want a little more. I will concur with others that it was cheap and convenient. I had a slice of pizza a soda and some wings for only $11. The pizza might have been slightly old but it was what I expected. The wings were on the drier side but I thought they were better than I expected.\n"]
25.Agava,[u'A friend gave me a $10 gift card to Agava so while down in the area hiking a group of us decided to check it out for brunch. We arrived around 2 pm on a Sunday. The place was moderately full but we were quickly seated. There was live music and a nice vibe to the place; very eclectic southwest style decor with nice tables and seating in a dining room area plus a bar area.\n\nThe only menu available was the brunch menu and by the time we got there they were already out of several of the specials. I felt a little disappointed only because I was hoping to be able to order off the main menu. But I ended up getting the black bean burger with a side of guacamole. It was very tasty good portion size and between the crema it came with and the guac it was satisfying and not too dry.\n\nMy friends had the Huevos Rancheros and the Bruce Berry (skillet scramble) and both were happy with the freshness depth of flavor portion size and overall presentation.\n\nWhat really made the experience though was the service. Our server was very attentive had a good sense of humor immediately put us at ease and got us our drink order let us know what they were out of answered questions made recommendations - all in all we had a great rapport and really enjoyed our time there. \n\nWas the food the best brunch ever? No but I would definitely go back and I am really looking forward to sampling dishes off the dinner menu!\n' u"I really WANT to like Agava more than I actually do I think. Granted I have only tried a few items on their menu - the flatbreads are delicious but the black bean burger was sub-par (too large and no discernible texture). We do love the atmosphere and the drinks though and the bartender who served us tonight (we moved to the bar after dinner) was totally sweet and professional and made me a hot toddy for my sore throat!\n\nNow for the most important part: PLEASE either print a clearly marked gluten-free menu or train your servers how to better handle Celiac disease. Both times I've come here I've been told that they had a gluten free menu but it wasn't printed - both times my server has been super nice about guiding us through the menu which is appreciated but they have multiple times told us that certain items are gluten free when they aren't (tonight I was told the black bean burger is gluten free when it clearly comes on a bun.... another time I ordered a GF pizza but it came with deep fried shallots). This isn't a problem for me but is for my husband and now we feel as though we really need to have our guard up / be careful when ordering from this restaurant. Our server brought us chips and salsa and only after waiting for the chips and her bringing it did she tell us they were in a shared fryer... And I say this totally NOT blaming these servers but management: PLEASE do a better job training them for being allergy-friendly. We'd like to feel as safe as possible when we go out to dinner!\n" u'Agave has always been a restaurant that\'s in my peripheral but I finally ventured out to try it last month. I had somewhat high expectations coming in because I have been wanting to go for years.\n\nI ordered both small plates and an entree. I don\'t remember all the small plates I got (some were daily specials) but I do remember the Pork Belly being particularly good. I think I also got a Hangar steak? (I\'m referring to their online menu right now and I don\'t recall the steak that\'s listed on there being the one I got) but that was alright as well.\n\nAgava is definitely a place you have to be "in the mood" for. I\'d say it\'s overpriced but the plating and quality of food are worth it if you\'re willing to spend it. I wouldn\'t zoom back here anytime soon but the first visit I made left me satisfied enough to come back again.\n' u'The tuna tostada was excellent and the Cacio e Pepe was also really good. Very nice atmosphere and service. Highly recommended\n' u"I came here for dinner with a friend.  I love places that give you salsa and chips at the table because I get hangry easily.  The chips were warm and the salsa tasted like it was made there.  The best part of the meal were the small plates we ordered and split.  The Butternut Squash Farotto and Brussels Sprouts were delicious!  I wish I could make them like that at home.  The small plates set the bar high for the meal but I didn't really enjoy the tempura-fried shrimp tacos.  The taco itself needed a sauce and was very dry.  The beans and rice on the side were meh.  I don't know maybe they needed more seasoning.  If I go back I might just stick to their small plates.\n" u'We arrived without a reservation and the hostess was incredibly accommodating there is a bar where one can get a drink and then hang out by the "takeout/waiting area" not the most comfortable waiting area but they don\'t limit you from being able to have a beverage while you wait. The team of staff were very friendly and helpful to get us in sooner and the food was excellent and well priced with solid sharing portions.   The pork loin stuffed with leek and Brie is not for the picky eater. It is great but a huge portion.  I highly recommend the broccoli. \nI never try to pretend I am at all a foodie in any of my reviews but I loved the atmosphere wall art and care that was taken by the staff.  This is a great spot to take a family or large party.  Not for the quiet Romantic eve but a wonderful time\n' u"I've been here about 4 previous times Salsa Night Brunch & Dinner but my dinner experience this time was horrible. The flies were out of control on the back patio. I understand that it is outside seating but there were many bugs and flies that were a result of lack of ventilation and plants touching us at our table.\n\nWe asked to be moved twice but both times were rejected. Also my friends and I both got burgers (The Richard and The Agava) and they were both really dry and took about an hour to be ready. As for customer service we were met maybe 3 times during out whole meal. And one of the male waiters had long flowing hair...not in a ponytail or hat.\n\nUsually I enjoy the atmosphere of Agava and the appetizers but I won't be going back for a while.\n" u'Agava has a pretty good dinner menu a fun bar and salsa on Wednesdays but the real gem is brunch. Ithaca has a few good brunch places and this is definitely one of them. One of the reasons why restaurants serve bread is to welcome guests (and feed the impulsive and hungry) - at Agava it\'s cornbread and biscuits already a couple of points plus on my scale.\n\nTheir mimosas are delicious I would highly recommend the ginger pomegranate!!\n\nThe boyfriend always gets shrimp & grits - he forgets what it is he gets and tries to order something else and I have to remind him "no it\'s really the shrimp & grits you want." And for good reason.\n\nFor me I like to mix it up with the specials: they have different omelettes and pancakes every couple of weeks or so. \n\nI also like the Tchefuncte (Pronounce: KAY-FUNK-TAY). Ciabatta bread sandwiches are big and a bit messy to eat though. I would recommend eating it as a open-faced sandwich. Yelpers love this - you\'ll see plenty of pictures. \n\nThe bruce berry is a great option for vegetarians - you can get corn tortillas too for a healthier or gluten free swap.\n\n\nFor dessert ask for more biscuits and cornbread. But do it halfway thru the meal so it\'s not so obvious. :X\n' u"Came here for dinner for the first time. \n\nFood - 3\nI was actually disappointed with the food. The only dish that was quit good was the appetizer Brussels sprouts. Tuna was overcooked and flavorless. Dips for the puff bread dips were flavorless. Shiitake mushrooms were ok but covered in grease/oil. I didn't try lots of things on the menu but the few things i had didn't instill promise. Cocktails were pretty good.\n\nAtmosphere - 5\nI really like the setting. Nice decor. On Friday night it was a very alive atmosphere. They have outside seating and on Wednesdays there is salsa dancing. Well designed place.\n\nService - 5\nFriendly staff. The food came quickly. Nothing negative to report.\n\nValue/Price - 1\nI find this place overpriced given that the food was pretty bland. Most appetizer are $8-12 flatbreads $12-17 and entrees $17-35. I will most likely not return.\n" u'This place has really plummeted in the past few years. The food has gotten more expensive and less good. Tonight our service was atrocious our food was tasteless and cold and we were generally unimpressed. I will not be returning.\n' u"Just came here for my second time:\n\nThe first time I went with a group of 6 for dinner. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated almost immediately which was nice. Right off the bat we were slightly disappointed because they had changed the menu. Before coming I had looked at the menu online and was really excited about the street corn appetizer. I love street corn so I was excited to have it but when I went I saw they had taken it off. Similarly my friends had been to Agava before and had the taquitos but those were no longer on the menu either. They asked us if we wanted chips and guacamole and we all agreed to split an order- BIG MISTAKE. Don't bother getting the guacamole- it's really really bad and overpriced at $8. The salsa was also bad (I prefer my salsa chunky with a lot of flavor and a little spice this salsa was runny and bland) but complimentary so it didn't bother me as much. \nThe drinks we ordered were awesome. 5 of us split a pitcher of the strawberry margarita which was awesome and not too sweet which I liked. I believe the pitcher was $35 and by our estimations we figure that it was neither a good deal or a bad deal when comparing it to individual margaritas- in other words we didn't save money by getting the pitcher. No big deal though. One of my friends got a mojito which was awesome and we both loved. Later he and I split a pitcher of the white sangria which was okay but I wouldn't get it again. \nFor my main dish I got the Agava burger but with the lamb patty. My serving of fries was generous but I didn't love the house ketchup- will stick with Heinz next time. The burger was really tasty. \nOur service was super friendly and the server did an amazing job dividing up the bill successfully between our credit cards- she didn't seem confused or overwhelmed at all. I wish I had caught her name because she was awesome. Our total bill came to about $40 per person which I thought was pretty decent for an split appetizer entree and two drinks.\n\nSecond time I went I came for happy hour with two friends. We all got the Rita Madness which is $12 for a margarita flatbread and a house margarita. I thought it was an awesome deal and I loved the way my margarita was made but one of my friends wanted hers a little sweeter- the staff was happy to oblige and they brought her back a new sweeter marg. For happy hour they also have half-off pints so I tried a beer called Stone Enjoy by 5/30/2016. As the name suggests the brewery stopped producing it on May 30th which is something I will deeply mourn as it was possibly the best beer I have ever had and was so so smooth despite being 9.4% ABV and like 90 IBU. At half off it was $3 which was an incredible deal. \n\nAll in all the service was awesome but the selection of food and prices for dinner was a little disappointing. Also please Agava get a new guacamole recipe! Highly recommend going for Happy Hour as I think the deals are some of the best if not the best in Ithaca. Would definitely get the Rita Madness again.\n" u'Agava is offering a three-item prix-fixe lunch for $13.  No clue how long they\'ve been doing this but it\'s great idea and the execution was good.\n\nI had two sizzling-hot vegetarian enchiladas and a nice sized bowl of beef brisket chili.  These were served simultaneously with a generous scoop of house-made chocolate ice cream to follow.  \n\nThe other choices today included an upscale tuna melt mixed greens salad instead of chili and house-made raspberry sorbet instead of ice cream.  \n\nThe food was fresh and tasty and service was excellent--our server went out of her way to help a diner with a dietary restriction and she was attentive without being at all intrusive.\n\nA recent happy hour visit with colleagues was also surprisingly good:  I enjoyed the "smoked" mezcal margarita and the "LA Woman" was a standout among the three flatbreads we shared.\n\nI\'ve been a little let down by Agava in the past but recent positive experiences have bumped them up on my list of prospects.\n' u"Came here straight back to back for 3 days for lunch/dinner since I was staying right around the corner. The tacos were amazing! I didn't know I would be able to find a place like this in Ithaca. It felt like I was back in NYC. Really good!\n" u'Had high expectation but not impressed. Burger is dry and fries are ok. Probably will not return soon.\n' u'Two considerations you should might want to take it before heading off to Agava.\n\nDo you like flies with your food?\n\nHave you have Southwestern food before?\n\nLet\'s start with their flies. Because they are served with every course at Agava. From the time you sit to the time you leave you are waving the flies away from your drink your food your utensils.  When asked the waiter responded - "Yeah we have a lot of flies." Hello Board of Health!  Come close this place down. A fly dove and died in our half-finished pitcher of overly-lime margaritas. The waiter tried to whisk away the pitcher as if we were done to hide it. \n\nAs for the food. It is hard to find good Southwest food and in t he SYRACUSE area in general.  \n\nBut this was beyond horrible. Tacos were dry and tasteless. \n\nYes the flies added some crunch to every bit but they were east coast flies and did not have any hot pepper flavor.\n\nSave yourself. Stay away from Agava. Warn friends. Someone is going to get very sick here.\n' u'Restaurant has a great vibe! A bit pricy and not many options on the menu. Great place to go with friends and family :)\n' u'Great service delicious burgers but the flies on the back patio were outta control.  Please get more fans and/or light some citronellas candles (or other similar deterrent) to minimize the damn flies.\n' u'Nice setup and great ambiance on the spacious covered terrace but the food was just OK.\n\nStarted with a frozen mint julep which tasted overly sweet and more soapy than minty.\n\nApps were average and sounded better on the menu than they actually were in appearance and taste. These included the "LA Woman" flatbread (with burrata tomato basil olive oil smoked salt arugula) which in fact was just an ordinary flatbread pizza; the "Agava-style guacamole" which was over-blended (fully smooth) bland and tasted processed rather than fresh; and "Camacho" (described as "roasted cauliflower \'nachos\' poblano crema cheddar-jack cheese kale pickled jalape\xf1o") which were sodden and messy-looking.\n\nFor my main I had the "El Padre" tacos with pork onion cilantro guacamole & salsa verde. These were decent but again nothing special. The accompanying black beans over white rice were devoid of *any* flavor including salt - bizarre. Dessert was slightly-cloying peanut butter ice cream.\n\nService was pleasant and friendly.\n\nOverall very average food not especially well-prepared in nice surroundings. There are definitely other better options in town.\n' u'Atmosphere was very nice but the food was our issue.  We ordered a Agava burger and the Chicken Alfredo. Agava burger undercooked.  Was raw and mushy in the middle.  For 23 dollars portion was small and the Alfredo was very bland.  Our server was overwhelmed  with tables while other servers were just standing around.  He he did take the burger off the bill which was appreciated.\n' u'Second time here in a week. First time I really liked the decor and vibe but the special we got the O.R. which is a chili relleno that was hardly stuffed at all.  Very Dissappointing. \n\nThe second visit was a office luncheon and when the lunch was served everyone but two mates got their food.  It took 10 minutes before they saw their burgers.  Made for an awkward lunch. Everyone was well into their meal before they were served. \n\nNot sure I will give it a third try.  Too bad  great location but questionable service.\n']
15.Hawi Ethiopian Restaurant,[u"It's always fun trying new food. Ive had Ethiopian food before but it's been 5+ years. It was fun eating with my hands!\n\nWe ordered a lamb dish and chicken dish to share. Thought the portions were really small... \n\nIf portions were bigger I'd consider giving this place 5 stars\n" u'Favorite restaurant in Ithaca. I love Ethiopian food and whenever I get the chance to try it I always do. When I discovered this place in collegetown I swear I almost cried because typically the only place I find Ethiopian food is in large cities. \n\nAt any rate I\'ve lived in Ithaca for a little under 4 months and I think I\'ve been to this place about 6 or 7 times now. The service is horrible every time but the food is always A+. I especially like how they give you A TON of injera on the side. Sometimes places are stingy with it but I typically find I have extra to take home with me. \n\nIf you are an adventitious person and are looking to try something totally different but still very tasty....then go to Hawi.\n\nP.S. Don\'t be that irritating Ithacan who asks if all of the meat is "free range" or "grass fed" and if the injera is "Gluten Free" or if the vegetables are locally sourced....This is not the place to be a picky health nut. Eat the food how it\'s served in it\'s authentic form and don\'t catch an attitude when the response to those above questions is "NO".\n' u"I love Ethiopian food and had not had it in a while so I was glad when my friend suggested we come here for dinner.  I was a little skeptical it being central New York and having had the best Ethiopian food already (outside of Ethiopia at least) in the DMV area.  I ordered the vegetarian combo and my friend had the meat combo.  I'll be honest I didn't pay attention to the meat she ordered but there is a picture attached.  The food was fantastic. Misir Wat and Shiro are my favorite vegetarian dishes and I enjoyed them as usual. I don't usually like Keysir Alicha - the beets dish - but the way they were cooked had me cleaning off my plate. I'll definitely be back next time I am in Ithaca.\n" u'authentic and so yummy!  Portions are a good size. Restaurant is a bit small (maybe 10 tables) but the staff was kind!\n' u"Hawi was fairly dead for a Thursday night in Ithaca but at least there wasn't a wait! The service was decent but the waitress could have taken more time to explain the menu to us especially because my dad said he'd never has Ethiopian to her when asked. About the menu: it's a mess. It's kept in a lovely woven folder but is not secured by anything - when we opened our menus we were confused because the pages were wholly out of order. Not a huge deal but odd.\n\nWe shared the meat combo and has a great lamb dish with a green sauce and chicken with tomatoes and jalape\xf1os. Both were good and very flavorful. For the vegetables we had the split peas green beans and potatoes and cabbage with carrots. The split peas were the standout of the whole meal I thought. The chunks of potato and carrot were really much too large to eat with the injera. The green beans were bland.\n\nMy dad also had a mint lemonade which was delicious - very minty and not too sweet. Also Hawi is BYOB which is a rare find in Ithaca.\n" u"Came here on my first date-- the food was just magical and unforgettable. The trick is to order a traditional platter get a combo of everything-- alicha stew and veggie sides on injera. They don't serve much alcohols; but my partner and I still brought in some Chardonnay and they happily assisted us... Love this place would definitely come again with friends and family.\n" u'I\'m giving this place a solid two because the service was out of control. The waiter Andrew was nice but he clearly needed help. \n\nWe arrived at 7:15 waiting about twenty minutes just to be spoken to/ place our order and then the drinks didn\'t come out until thirty + minutes later. When the food finally came we did not have the injera! So now we\'re sitting here staring at our food as it gets cold! \n\nOrdering was confusing as he struggled to explain to us the eligible meats in the combo platter for three. We found no flexibility in the menu either. \n\nThe injera was ice cold and the tips were hard. \n\nOverall the food was not worth it at all. It wasn\'t worth the drive down to Ithaca nor was it worth the $98. Telling patrons you do not "accept" AmEx once we got the bill was not helpful. It would have been nice to know that earlier. Nothing was fresh at all. If you\'re looking for good ethiopian head to Rochester!!! Terrible service so so food. Blah\n' u'Amazing food in Ithaca. The place was super busy on Saturday evening and the staff did an excellent job accommodating everyone. They were also incredibly attentive for such a busy evening! We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We were a group of 7 (all vegetarian).\n\nNow the food! Excellent food. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a veggie combo of the 7 dishes for a group of 4. Every item was delicious! The misir wat deserves a special mention! \n\nIf we ever come back to Ithaca or drive nearby we will make sure to stop here!\n' u"We went here for my Sister's Graduation Dinner yesterday. Ithaca's ethnic cuisines are always lacking in flavor and often overpriced due to the location and lack of competition. Hawi definitely followed suit. The food was mediocre compared to other Ethiopian establishments in the country. The service was horrible. They claim to be BYOB but we were not offered ice bucket. Our waiter wore to many hats. He was the manager waiter greeter and runner. Our food was not hot. The final straw is when we were asked to leave right after we paid our check even though the place was empty. He claims another family wanted our table which was a lie!\n" u'Officially my first time dining Ethiopian cuisine. For the most part I would say that I enjoyed the meal but it was ridiculously overpriced. I ordered a $6 dollar drink that tasted interesting but was tiny and mostly diluted with ice. My family ordered the meat combo which was quite yummy but it was barely lukewarm. Also when we asked for more of the rolls they only gave us a few extra even though it was clearly not enough for four people. Overall it was decent but not worth the price we paid.\n' u'The food is wonderful especially the beef bozena shiro lamb jebeg wat the beets and carrots and cabbage.  The service is just unbelievably bad and inattentive.  We\'ve maybe been 10 times and each time we have to chase servers down to get a bottle opener and wine glasses.  This last time we stood in the door 10 mins waiting to be seated finally my husband grabbed a waiter and asked to be seated (we had a reservation) the response was surprise that we\'d want to be seated and would interrupt what the waiter was doing--they had just completely ignored us--not even said "Hi I\'ll be with you in second" just flat out ignored us as they walked past us again and again.  Really the service is laughably bad.\n' u"Lol I just recently discovered my love for Ethiopian food. =D LOL it's so much fun to get messy eating with hand. The food here is fun and tasty. We tried the veggie combo and meat combo and the two came together on one plate. Both taste really good!\n" u'The food quality at this Ethiopian restaurant is excellent - right up there with the best in DC.  The Misir is as spicy as it should be the Collards and Yekik are perfectly flavored and the ingera has just the right texture.\n\nSo why not 5 stars?  The portion sizes.  Too stingy.  On the veggie combo platter there is basically an ice cream scoop sized portion of each item per person.  This is maybe half the volume that you would get at a typical Ethiopian restaurant in my extensive experience.  So it  if Hawi could up their portion sizes they would be among the best Ethiopian restaurants in the country.\n' u"So I found myself on the commons in Ithaca and  noticed this little Ethiopian restaurant. \n\nEthiopian food in upstate New York?\n\nI haven't had good Ethiopian food since Los Angeles so with some trepidation I gave it a try. And I am so glad I did. \n\nThe only slightly off note was the injera wasn't perfect - a little stickier than it should have been. But the the food was authentic and delicious! We ordered some meat and veggie samplers to get a taste of what they had and it was wonderful. Really brought me back the the taste of Little Ethiopia. \n\nI can't recommend this plan highly enough. If you're new to Ethiopian food try coming for lunch and get a meat and veggie sampler. You won't be disappointed.\n" u'Had a great meal here!\n\nWe went in on a Wednesday night at about 9pm after finding this was one of the few restaurants still open that had significant vegetarian options that could accommodate a friend visiting from out of town. \n\nThe server was very nice and answered all of our questions about the food and drinks. She was also great about bringing out additional bread when we needed it and the check at the end of the meal.  \n\nThe flavors of the food were very good. We got the vegetarian platter for three and each item on the dish was distinct and tasty on its own. Some were spicy some were not. All in all it had great variety and was a great purchase. We also got the peanut tea (which was great!) and the Hawi special (a drink made of sesame seeds milk and honey) which was just okay. The tea had a much smoother texture and was more drinkable whereas the Hawi special had a granular texture and not as flavorful. \n\nOverall we had a great visit to Hawi and I can definitely see us going again.\n' u"Hawi is my favorite restaurant in Ithaca. My girlfriend and I went there almost every week when we were living in Ithaca. We would typically get the meat combo for 2. My favorite meat dishes were beef tibs and lamb yebeg alicha. The lamb gomen besiga is also very good. Our favorite vegetable dishes were the misir wat yater kik alicha and shiro. The injera is unlimited and delicious. I live in Manhattan now and I still yearn for Hawi. \n\nAlso it's BYOB and there's a wine shop across the street as well as a gas station with a decent bottled beer selection. \n\nThe only downsides are that the service here can be kind of inconsistent. Many times we went they only had one server so service can be slow or a little unpredictable. The kitchen could also use a bit of operational improvement - they occasionally (two or three times out of the at least 20-30 times we've been there) ran out of injera or took a long time to make more.\n" u"One of the better Ethiopian meals I've had!  We had the special sampler with the beats collards chicken drumsticks beef tips and beef tartar.  All were outstanding except for the beef tips which were a bit too charred.  Highly recommended if you enjoy this sort of food.\n" u'Lunch was very very good. Ordered the 2 person combo with lamb chicken(2 meats) and string beans collared greens and carrots(3 vegtebles). The flavor of the food was splendid...unique and delicious. The lamb was a tad bit too salty so I simply gobbled up all the chicken! "Alef" the waiter was genuine and transparent...took the time to explain the menu and process. Clean and warm both in temperature and atmosphere. Great time.\n' u"It's a meal and an experience- loved eating with my hands. Make sure you come with people who you're comfortable sharing with. Delicious food and a lot of vegetarian options!\n" u'I have been to 4 different Ethiopian restaurants across 2 states. Hawi is my favorite.\nWhere to begin? The misir wat was smokey spicy and subtly sweet. The yatir kik alicha (split peas) was the best and most full-bodied I\'ve ever had - warm and savory like exotic comfort food. The Collard greens were delicious as well...slightly bitter but balanced well by the flavor of the spices and oil it was cooked in. In short every vegetarian dish here (and I had the vegetarian combo so I sampled all of them) is delicious uniquely flavored and -- bonus! -- vegan. In addition the waiter we had was very helpful and the kitchen brewed a whole batch of peanut coffee just so I could try a sample ("sample" being an entire cup). So service was great.\n\nOh and the Ethiopian peanut coffee? AMAZING. Get it. Get it now.\n']
138.Jade Garden Restaurant,[u'Ordered Singapore Mei-Fei (spell check) but was exactly the dish satisfying my urge. Includes shrimp chicken and pork with assortment of stir-fried vegetables with of course rice noodles (angel hair pasta style thin and soft but great with flavor. Slight curry sensation. Overall the perfect dish just under $11.\n' u'Have to say for a little lunch buffet it was surprisingly good with a decent variety of dishes. Lets see... I can recall both fried tofu and a softer tofu version n vegetables string beans sweet n sour chicken chicken on a stick egg roll crab rangoon chicken n vegetables beef n mushroom orange chicken lo mein dumplings. Nothing was particularly outstanding everything was particularly what you would expect. It was particularly affordable.\n' u"I ate here with friends.  It is really set up for take out and delivery not sit down eating which explains why the parking lot is empty and it wasn't crowded.  They have tables if you come in but you have to place your order at the counter and pay in advance. \nSomeone posted pictures of a buffet but there was no buffet when we went there on a weekday for lunch and it didn't look like they had room for one.  Maybe the buffet was at the old space.\nThe food was standard American Chinese food.  I ordered cold sesame noodles chicken wings crab rangoon and steamed shrimp dumplings.  The shrimp dumplings were the translucent kind.  The crab rangoon was crispy but strangely sweet.   I liked everything I got.  Although the sesame noodles were a bit bland.   I prefer my home recipe. \nThey have bubble teas with and without milk.  And with black tapioca balls or lychee jelly.   But no popping boba.   I love bubble tea and wish someone would open a bubble tea shop that sold all the teas in the posters in the windows.\n" u"I ordered delivery to my work it's a holiday so I was happy that they were open. They have a 20 dollar min. For delivery which I hate since there is a delivery fee anyways. And $20 is on the high side for Chinese if your weigh under 300 pounds. They were 15 minutes later than the 45 minutes they said so it took an hour. There was no sauce for the egg rolls no silverware no napkins. The food tastes good but I wish I had something to eat it with... Honestly I can't even enjoy this food right now because I'm so disgusted with the service.\n" u"Truly the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. Kung-bo should be hot and spicy not sweet and covered with salt crystals. The pork fried rice was downright inedible; it tasted like a weird mixture of Minute Rice and couscous gummy and just godawful.  I'm nauseated- thought Capital Kitchen was bad until I tried Jade Garden.\n" u"After eating at Capital Corner for years I decided to try something new. I am sorry I did not try Jade Garden sooner! Everything about my experience was infinitely better than with Capital Corner. Jade Garden's food is wonderful. I have tried their crab Rangoon hot and sour soup (so spicy and good!) General Tso's Chicken beef and mushroom and vegetable fried rice. Everything so far has been delicious. The staff are friendly and the delivery came about 15 minutes early as well. Love Jade Garden!\n" u"Very nasty food had no flavor. \nPoint blank period \nDon't order from here WASTE OF MONEY!!\n" u'Jade Garden is in it\'s new location at Meadow St. & W. State St.  Easy access and a nice interior setting.  This is good Chinese take-out from friendly people and in a restaurant that is clean well-equipped and produces good food in a prompt and delicious way.  For many years in Ithaca I have always had one "go-to" Chinese take-out restaurant.  Now Jade Garden will be an equal yet more conveniently located option for me and I anticipate going there regularly.  Making a move from the 100 block of N. Aurora St. to their current new location could prove to be a gold mine not only because of the good food but because of the genius location both where traffic flow is concerned and because of it\'s central location easily accessible by commuters headed in any direction.  So I wish them good luck and I encourage you to have a meal there!\n' u"First off I would not come here for authentic Chinese food. Period.\n\nThe place was empty when we arrived and the atmosphere was... bleh. The server was kind and helpful but that doesn't help with the quality of the food. We ordered 5 dishes family style:\n\n- Lemon chicken\n- Seaseme chicken\n- Shrimp with lobster sauce\n- Schezuan beef\n- Some vegetable dish with garlic sauce\n\nEdible but not up to par. I also had to clarify to the waiter that we wanted rice which did not come in a big bowl (which I was surprised)--and it came much later after all the dishes had been served. Meh. The portions were adequately sized\n\nWhy did I come here again? Oh that's right--it was during St. Patrick's Day weekend and every other place was booked with inebriated college kids. That and all of my friends were really craving Chinese food and it was one of the closest place that was open and wasn't packed. \n\nTo be fair it wasn't that bad; it just doesn't fit in with the quality and style I'm used to. I suppose this place would be decent for those who want more of an Americanized taste.\n" u'bleh.  I should have taken the negative reviews more seriously.  I ordered sweet and sour chicken and fried dumplings to go (I know super healthy... whatever).  Usually I get these from Spicy Asian when I need my fried food fix but I decided to try somewhere else and I definitely regret it.\n\n1) "15 minutes" for pickup time was actually 30.\n2) The chicken was cooked a bit too much.\n3) The dumpling sauce is sweet (?) and I ended up just making my own at home from things I have on hand.\n4) The dumplings themselves have a weird taste to them.  I honestly can\'t pinpoint it but it\'s not pleasant and I ended up chucking pretty much everything I ordered but the chicken.\n\nBack to Spicy Asian for me.\n' u"Everything had a burnt taste to it as if their pans weren't clean. I ordered my rice with no onions it had onions!\n" u'This might be the worst Chinese restaurant in Ithaca and thats hard to accomplish because most of them are so bad. There is nothing exciting on their menu so I went with the standard chicken and Brocoli. The chicken and brocoli I make at home is far better and I have no experience in Chinese cooking. The dish tasted like they cut up brocoli and chicken and just stir fried it with a low quality soy sauce. The brocoli was over cooked and the chicken tasted a bit funky. Absolutely awful.\n' u"Service is fast and relatively friendly and the food is great if you know what to order. I usually get the honey chicken which is consistently good. I've gotten coconut shrimp a few times but it's hit or miss. For delivery they are extremely fast. Grubhub says it'll take 60 minutes but it's usually only 20-30. Pick-up orders usually take 5-10 minutes to be ready. Their fried rice is the best I've had in Ithaca. Definitely the best Chinese take-out in Ithaca. MILES above Capital Corner in terms of service and quality\n" u"3 stars basically because the delivery is quick and service is good but food is  mostly average and dishes are probably a bit too expensive compared to better places I've been to outside Ithaca. My SO likes the cheap lunch buffet. The Singapore mei fun is surprisingly good.\n" u'Horrible is actually a compliment. This was the worst Chinese food I ever tasted.  The meat (chicken and beef) was dry and had a disgusting aftertaste.  The shrimp was rubbery and the vegetables had no flavor. The egg-rolls were just flaky dough. Even the fortune cookies were stale.\nI wish I could forget the entire experience but I fear my tastebuds will never forgive me.\n' u"I am writing this review after reviewing another Ithacan Chinese Restaurant Capital Corner.  I give this restaurant a great review on the relative scale so I shall write another review upon future experiences.  I have only eaten food from here once.\n\nAfter a terrible experience with the food I ordered for delivery from Capital Corner not arriving I decided to order from Jade Garden on Campusfood.com.  Despite the stated 60 minute estimated delivery time the food arrived in 30 minutes which was great because I was very hungry!  \n\nGreat value on the food large portions and good Chinese takeout!  My boyfriend ordered the Sesame Chicken which he gets from each Chinese restaurant he orders from.  It was good not greasy with a really sweet sauce.  There was way too much sauce however.  I ordered a dish with mixed vegetables and chicken pork beef and shrimp.  The meat was tender and there was a nice variety of vegetables as well.  There were green bell peppers in the dish which I don't usually see in Chinese food and I just picked around them because I don't like them.  Oh yes and we were able to substitute brown rice for white rice at no extra charge. Good stuff.  No complaints about this restaurant.  This is my new Chinese place for delivery while I live in Ithaca as a Cornell student...\n" u"Wasn't too sure about this place it looked empty.  Then I realized it is because everyone either takes carryout and takes advantage of the awesome $1 delivery charge here!  We had two orders of General Tso's chicken with an egg roll and fried rice combo (7.95 each) it was more than us girls could eat but just the right size for a guy probably.  The food wasn't greasy and we threw the leftovers in the garbage of our hotel room thinking the next day the whole room would smell like chinese food but it never happened!  Very good!\n" u"The good: Delivery was fast and hot and the fee was low which I always appreciate. And oh those fried dumplings. A slice of heaven! The vegetable egg roll that came with the combo platter was also delicious. And the coconut shrimp was great!\n\nThe bad: The fried rice was mediocre at best. Although the pork bits tasted good the rice was far too bland. Kinda mushy not enough soy sauce maybe? And not enough vegetables in my opinion... taking off one star for that. \n\nBased on the existing reviews and my own experience I could see this place being pretty hit or miss. I'll be getting those dumplings again though.\n" u'best chinese in ithaca.\n\nEdit: this place is a hit or miss. I would pick it over other chinese in Ithaca though. Cus they are all pretty bad.\n' u'The worst food I had ever had. No quality no presentation nothing good in this restaurant. This is totally wastage of money.\n']
39.Fat Jack‚Äôs BBQ,[u"Solid. Great burnt ends. Another reviewer is complaining that portions are small but I don't get it. I got the burnt ends platter it came with two sides and it was more food than I can eat. Similarly true of my friend's ribs and sausage combo platter.\n\nThe do warn you that they have limited availability of burnt ends because they take so long to make. I was prepared to get brisket instead but they had burnt ends so I enjoyed the burnt ends. Yum. I ended up wasting a couple of them when I got too full -- wish I had brought them home.\n\nI only tried the spicy BBQ sauce and I really liked it. Had a kick but not too much. The flavor was pretty sweet which I like but other folks may not. They have other sauces (including honey BBQ and buffalo) on offer.\n\nBig dining room. Probably would be good for groups. You order at the counter then they bring it out. I think they do not have any beer/wine/liquor. They do have rootbeer on tap and regular fountain sodas and various bottled sodas. The only fancy soda at all was the Ithaca Root Beer on tap -- nothing like Izzy's or other stuff in bottles.\n" u'Food is great you will not go hungry lunch menu is good value\n\nnot much of an atmosphere though and mostly working crowd\n' u"Probably one of the more disappointing BBQ places I've ever been too. No better than a Sticky Lips. Not even close to the quality of Dinosaur BBQ. \n\nTheir meat is sub par. Ribs aren't great - definitely not the fall off the bone deliciousness I would have liked. Skimpy portions for the price especially if it's a counter service restaurant. Their dry rub is like a sprinkling of seasoning with a sauce on top (they totally missed the point of a dry rub). The chicken tasted like Texas Roadhouse level chicken but that would have been a better deal price wise. \n\nTheir sides were completely bland. The collard greens were probably the most exciting part which is not saying much for the Mac and cheese corn or rice. The corn bread was probably the tastiest thing I ate and it was just alright. \n\nThey also got our order wrong at first and they literally recited it back to us at the register before placing it. \n\nMaybe we just had a bad experience but we probably won't be returning.\n" u"It's certainly no Dinosaur BBQ but it's ok if you're craving some barbecue without doing it yourself. Staff seems a bit clueless and they were out of burnt tips which is why we came in to give them a try in the first place.\n" u'Fat Jacks fits in the Ithaca scene as a solid bbq joint. TBH there is no need to drive to Dino anymore. I have tried pretty much every meat on the menu and here are some of my favorites:\n\n- grilled wings w dry rub\n- ribs (meaty and a lil chewy like they should be. I hate the overcooked stuff that falls right off the bone when they boil the ribs)\n- pulled pork\n- burnt ends!!! \n\nThe sides are ok but I absolutely love their green bean fries. When in a pinch go with cole slaw or beans. \n\nPrices are not cheap but not high. I think the $$ rating on Yelp is accurate. I have never ordered out as I like my bbq hot and fresh. A good place to pig out.\n' u'Ithaca NY is the last place you would expect a barbecue joint but Fat Jacks is the real deal. I have enjoyed barbecue from Austin to Baton Rouge. This place is in the top 10!!!\n\nMy Ithaca student and I stopped in based on the good reviews. We each  had half rack with the Memphis dry rub. The ribs are meaty and tender and for most a half is enough. But when in Rome keep eating. I also tried the beef brisket collard greens and red beans and rice. Wow a lot of food but we enjoyed every bite.\n\nYou order at the counter and the friendly staff helps you along. When your food is ready they deliver it to your table. The spot is not downtown but on Elmira rd near Buttermilk falls. Go for hike and Pig Out!!!\n' u'Our first time in with the whole family and we were pleasantly surprised. In fact I wish we had gone into this joint a long time ago.\n\nPeople at the counter were super nice and courteous and the food came out very quickly.\n\nHad a half rack of ribs with hot BBQ and dry rub and it was excellent. Also had two flavors of wings and the smokey flavor was some of the best I\'ve had in town.\n\nThe BBQ beans side was good and so was the collard greens. The "BBQ Sundae" is spicy and interesting if a bit saucy. The sweet potato wedges were ok and the Coca-Cola freestyle fountain is totally adequate.\n\nMy kids had fries and a grilled cheese sandwich. They were pleased and I thought the quality  of those items seemed above average as well. The menu is extensive and I\'m looking forward to going back to try more.\n\nFun and relaxed family atmosphere. Cute little signs everywhere give this place an old-timey locally-owned family-run kind of feel.\n\nThe fact all this takes place in an old Pizza Hut building only adds to the charm.\n' u"The food was amazing. I was so surprised to eat collard greens like this in upstate New York. The greens were just as soulful\n. I was shocked. The Mac and cheese was a little above average but could use the Pattie Labelle touch. The pork ribs were slamming and tender. The sweet potato pie Is just like nana's. A little disappointed that there were no real bananas in the banana pudding. Overall I was happy!\n" u"When this place first opened I was a big fan. \nThe barbecue is not the best I've ever had and slightly overpriced but solid. By and large the staff is very friendly. \n\nSince then:\n\nOnce I was there when an employee was having top-of-the-lungs screaming match with someone inside the restaurant. Fortunately that was before I ordered and I just walked out.  Or rather didn't walk in because you could hear perfectly well from the outside.  So uncomfortable. \n\nTwice I showed up before the posted closing time (that's on Google on Yelp on their website and on the door) and the place had been closed for quite some time.  Nothing makes me more angry -- if you don't want to stay open until closing pick an earlier closing time. \n\nIt's just not worth it!\n\nGo to Gateway kitchen where the guy is nice and not insane. \n\nGo to the Fat Jack's that just opened in Cortland. \n\nDon't drive out to the edge of town to find the place closed or with people at each other's throats.\n" u"Four stars primarily for the meat. Burnt ends and brisket were excellent. Great smoky flavor! BBQ beans were good but tasted like slightly amended Bush's from the can. Did not love the smashed potatoes; they tasted slightly weird (hard to describe.) Their sauces were also excellent including the mild and hot BBQ.\n\nLOVED the draft Ithaca root beer. It was the best I've ever had!\n\nMarty the woman at the counter who took our order was delightful; personality plus!!\n\nI would definitely come back when and if ever again in Ithaca.\n" u'The ribs are the best thing I think.  I like a half slab of Memphis dry rub. Very good.\n' u"Visited in June. Had the Notorious P I G Samich with Fries. It's a gut buster and worth every calorie. The place is short on ambiance. But you can't eat ambiance.\n" u"Recently I came across this place over yelp and after reading all the reviews I thought it was pretty safe to order again in Ithaca LOL ( seriously I have a issue with ordering food in Ithaca ) \n\nI place my order over yelp using EAT24 I think it is I ordered : 1/2 rack of pork ribs with pulled pork and mac and cheese with mash potatoes and gravy .. my son order the cheese burger and fries \n\nDelivery didnt take so long like other places i know in Ithaca .. The guy was really friendly and nice \n\nNow to the food : I would give it a 3 1/2 stars almost a 4 but I was really hungry so who knows... \n\nmy ribs was half dry rub and half mild BBQ ... The dry rub was disgusting. It was really gross to the point that if I got a little on the other side of the ribs I would spit it out. The other side of the ribs the mild BBQ was pretty great nice and tender ... \n\nThe pulled pork was amazing ... I enjoyed eating it ... Just great \n\nThe sides : The mac and cheese tasted like a pre pack microwave mac and cheese you know those where you just add water... Really wish they would add more flavor or idk just add something to it ... It didn't taste fresh ... The mash potatoes was alright nothing major .... I think chilis mash potatoes is better and I'm not a fan of chilis ... the cornbread was GREAT .. Really wished I had order two .. Please don't make that mistake order 2 ... \n\nAnyways what can I say order all.. I do give this place a passing grade but really wish they would tweak their sides a little.. just a little more effort ... A little pricey $30 for my little one and I but  By far the only place in Ithaca that I have order from and been some what satisfied with...  \n\nPs: I remind you I haven't ate all day so this review is based on eating with a completely empty stomach\n" u'Simply delicious BBQ. The pulled pork was moist  tender and flavorful.   Yummy crisp fries and plenty of them.   A wide selection of sauces all very tasty.  \nPrice was amazing.  Friendly service and so clean. \nI would Highly recommend\n' u'Great BBQ place. Ribs were very good and loaded fries were awesome. Dont forget the cajun pickles.\n' u"Sweet holy Moses. \n\nFirst time here and it's super delicious!  \nI did my best to finish 1/2 chicken green bean fries and Mac'n'cheese. I can't even move...\n\nMy lady had some kind of pulled meat sandwich (chicken pork and brisket) coleslaw and sweet potato fries (covered in cinnamon and sugar of course!). All of it was fantastic.\n\nWe are huge fans already. Service is fast and friendly.\n\nThe green bean fries were a little over cooked but the flavor is there so we'll have to come back and try it again.  Also the menu is a little hard to read so give yourself a little time to get through it!\n" u"Coming from Texas I craved BBQ every once in a while during college. One day I decided to order from Fat Jacks and now I still order from here every once in a while. The pork ribs are amazing the chicken is great and the sides/cornbread is top notch. The only thing that I thought was lacking was the brisket which was fairly dry/tough v.s. some of the amazing brisket I had back home. But all in all a solid place to get your BBQ fix in good ole' Ithaca.\n" u"Hm just OK. The ribs are the high point of the menu as far as I can tell. They are nicely done and very meaty--a good value and very filling.\n\nI could take or leave the rest of it. The fries are soggy and not very tasty. The mac & cheese was not served hot so it was not very appetizing. Unmelted cheese sprinkles on the top. The greens are passable. The cornbread is soggy almost to the point of being wet like dripping wet. Not very appetizing either. \n\nIn the end I didn't even finish my meal and I was famished when I went it. Not because I was full but because the food just doesn't seem to want to be eaten. I might go back to try some of their other meats but I'm not likely.\n" u'First time here \nGood menu full of choices \nWe had the kombo meals with brisket sausage pulled pork and pulled chicken \nAll were very good and the sauce was very flavorful \nWe ll definitely come back again\n' u'Great menu and awesome food. Definitely not a BBQ person by nature as I was vegetarian for three years and am still adjusting to the omnivore meat-eating lifestyle; but I enjoyed their chicken dishes and the sides were delicious.\n']
184.Subway,[u'My go to spot for a quick grab. Keith serves up my sandwich just how I like it.\n' u'I ordered at 6:17pm on a Sat night. I called the store to say Grubhub had the wrong address on the order. The person on the phone assured me he would pass the message along to the driver. An hour and 20min later I get a call from the driver from the wrong address. I explained to the driver he was supposed to be informed of the correct address.\n\nI received my order at 7:50pm. State st. to south side took an hour and a half. I get quicker service from the subway in Collegetown.\n']

75.On the Street Pitas,[u"Excellent!  Had the gyro and falafel as a side the falafel was incredible a must have.  For the gyro it's a little buffet the pit together right in front of you so you can easily customize it.  Keep in mind it's small sits maybe 6 but well worth the visit plus excellent choice in music and very cool decor.\n" u'Outstanding falafel!  Choice of toppings is romaine spinach cucumber tomato onion and olives plus feta tzatziki and/or tahini.  Choice of white or wheat pita too.  The food is so delicious and fresh.\n\nChicken pita tastes pretty good but is all dark meat if that makes a difference to you.  Baba ghannouj smoky but otherwise a bit flat on flavor.\n' u'The best falafel in central New York by far! Delicious expertly crafted great service and very reasonable prices. Aside from the bizarre obscure location this place is a real gem in Ithaca.\n' u"The best falafel & pita I've had in years! Awesome fresh toppings - spinach cucumbers tomatoes peppers feta. Excellent tzatziki sauce - and they don't scrimp either! \nJust a couple of tables inside. Friendly folks prepare your food to order right in front of you. \nWill definitely be back!\n" u"Love this place!  Pitas are full of fresh lettuce spinach tomatoes and cucumbers.  I skip the onions. First you eat the salad with the olives feta and zaziki sauce.  When it's finally small enough to pick up you bite into the pita and the meat of your choice and it's a great experience.  \nAnd a side of fresh fries is never a bad idea.\n" u'We love the falafel pita. The falafels are different than at most other places and have more texture which is nice. The meal comes with a large heap of salad veggies which are always fresh and make the meal feel healthy. :) When we want to indulge we order the curly fries so good!\n' u'Eat at On The Street.  OMG. \n\nThis is The Best place for take out lunch or dinner.  Fresh Fresh Fresh... \n\nColorful fresh a feast for the eyes and tastebuds.  Menu is simple - which is always a good sign.  EVERYTHING is made to order and all sauces etc. are made in house.  Huge value for your buck.  \n\nOn The Street has become our take out habit replacing pizza and Chinese.\n\nCheaper healthier and way tastier....\n' u"Stopped in here today because the Hubs wanted to go here for lunch. Since I was hijacking him for a haircut I obliged. The place reminded me of the inside of a busy food truck. Tiny and cluttered just enough equipment to get the job done. I had the falafel pita which was quite delicious. The staff was generous with all the fresh toppings they had to offer. Hubs had the babaghanoush pita they didn't have much left but were willing to throw in some additional hummus. It was silky smooth and outstanding our son ordered the Breakfast pita which was so large a hungry teenager couldn't even finish it. Fast friendly service. Will definitely go back.\n" u'Falafel is so delicious and fresh! Big generous portions of everything on a tasty pita. So good tip big!\n' u'The two stars are only because the staff was friendly.\nThe place is dirty and unsanitary. Doors are open food is uncovered and flies are everywhere. \nThe meat is clearly precooked so when they serve it they just reheat it. It\'s rubbery dry and flavorless. I couldn\'t find a single juicy piece. Maybe this is a great spot for poor college kids??? That\'s why the great reviews??? But it\'s not even cheap!!! $9-12! \nA great name for this spot would be "hole in the wall". Just shut the place down for 2 days and wash it please- people can get sick!\n' u'Fantastic alternative to traditional fast food and burgers.  I regularly get the falafel pita delicious falafel with a great salad. Quick service and friendly people.  I highly recommend for takeout.  There is one small table for eat in but this is really a take out place.\n' u'Such good food! Huge portion. We got pork souvlaki and falafel sandwich. Really enjoyed it.  I would return.\n' u"Anyone that has had real falafel will be very disappointed. It is completely devoid of any spice and by spice I mean flavor.  It's not made with any parsley either leaving it heavy and brown. Falafel should be a greenish-brown my friends!  The pita was fresh enough and warmed but all the ingredients were haphazardly piled on top leaving you eating something more like a sloppy salad than a pita wrap.  The tahini had almost no garlic or lemon...again flat and boring.  Two stars cause the veggies seemed fresh enough and it's better than eating at a McDonald's but I wouldn't go back.\n" u"Not bad..kinda dirty hole in the wall. It's the only Mediterranean  fast food place in town.  Always brings back deadhead memories. Just wish they'd stop burning the lamb and clean it up a bit.\n" u"I stopped here for take out lunch today and was extremely pleased. \nHummus and pita were yummy especially liked that they warmed and grilled the pita bread!!  \nService was quick and friendly and the prices really can't be beat.\nI agree with other reviewers that the take out is interesting-like a goldfish in a bag but its what inside that counts!!\n" u"This Greek restaurant is absolutely amazing. Honestly one of the best Gyros I have ever had in my life!! It's a small place a little rundown but that doesn't keep them from making amazing food. Unfortunately I cannot give the restaurant a 5 star review simply because the staff here are a bit on the unfriendly side. The food is amazing though so I'm willing to handle the attitude of the lady behind the counter for a minute before I can dig in!\n" u"We heard great things about this place however the falafels were just too dry and coarse for us. Also the fries were very bland and soggy. They spiralized 4 whole potatoes and dumped them into the fryer but they didn't even bother to season them they just came straight from the fryer basket and onto the serving plate and became a soggy mess. We were expecting better!\n" u"Just finished having dinner here for the first time.  As i type we are sitting outside enjoying the lovely spring weather and watching a train go by.  Our dinner was amazing.  We have lived here almost 2 years and hadnt yet found a good greek restaurant.  This place is no frills but totally worth it.  They serve tons of food for the money.  I had a gyro with awesome tzatziki and curly fries fresh cut in-house.  Sooooooo good!  There's not a lot of inside seating so it may be a good idea to consider getting your dinner to as a plan b if the seats are taken.  And the staff?  So very very very accommodating kind efficient and knowledgeable about their product.  The young man and young lady who cooked our food fresh while we waited were THE best restaurant staff we have dealt with in Ithaca.  I HIGHLY recommend this place.\n" u"It's a pretty good hole-in-the-wall kinda of place. It's a small selection of wraps and salads. You get to choose what you want on top of you wraps. It tasted good. I'm a real big fan of pita breads and this place did not disappoint. I was with a group and it took awhile to get everyone's order. Also their take-out bags are like holding a goldfish. lol. It was interesting. \n\nI would come here for a lunch. It was not filling enough for dinner. Good food for the price. Almost everything is like $7.\n" u"I've had a falafel pita and a Gyro at the Farmer's Market location and once on the commons. They are reasonably tasty although the falafel was kind of dry. Nothing compared to places back home in Los Angeles but good for Ithaca.\n"]
84.New Delhi Diamonds Indian Restaurant,[u"GET THE DAL!\n Oh my goodness I couldnt have been more happy with this food - some of the best Indian I've had in a long time.  \n\nI got one of the dal dishes and it was perfectly spiced and a generous portion!  The garlic naan was SUPER garlicy - which I appreciated.  The Aloo naan was also incredible.  My husband and I also split soup and samosas as an app and both were fresh and delicious.\n\nThe atmosphere is nothing to write home about and the service on our night was pretty slow - but friendly! (even though there were only two other tables full at the restaurant at around 8:30pm on a weeknight).\n\nIn fact I would say in the future take-out is going to be our go too move. This place is so yummy!\n" u'We loved dining here! Our experience could not have been better. From the moment we arrived staff were friendly and attentive. The owner was flexible with the menu making me lamb tikka masala although it was not a menu item. We started off with some paneer pakora and meat samosas which were fresh and delicious. You could tell thag everything was made from scratch as it was piping hot! For our entrees we enjoyed tender lamb basmati rice and matar paneer. The food was prepared just as we like it (mild for me and medium for him). The paratha and naan were also freshly prepared. The kheer and gulab jamun were tasty too! We loved the mango and sweet lassis as well. We had a great dining experience at Diamonds and will definitely return. I cannot praise this place enough. You can definitely see the owners committment to excellent customer service and high quality food. Thank you Diamonds for being awesome!\n' u'Saturday lunch buffet lots of choice for only 9 bucks!! A great deal. I loved the aloo matar and potato patty. Soooo good!!\n' u'This is a family owned n operated restaurant. The place is very neat and clean. Service was quite fast. They may not always ask about spice levels for curries be sure to tell your preferred level to enjoy your food.  \n\nI ordered Daal tarka Punjabi parotta and Lussy. Food was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner after tiring day.\n' u"Only four stars because I have been quite spoiled by my hometown selections. But the food here is very good and their portions are huge!!! I ordered sag paneer and daal and didn't even get to the daal. Great value!\n" u"I came to Diamond's for the lunch buffet. Everything was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I came with a friend who has a severe peanut allergy and eating in restaurants is something she usually cannot do because of the possibility of peanut oil. So for those of you wondering this place is safe and peanut-free!\n\nReally delicious food and the buffet is inexpensive and all-you-can-eat! It's not a fancy place by any means but go for the food not the decor.\n" u'We came here to try the lunch buffet and certainly enjoyed it.  Plenty of decent veg and meat options and very tasty.  Service was very friendly as well. No real atmosphere to speak of. Nothing hugely memorable but a tasty pleasant meal.\n' u'Service was OK maybe a bit slow to engage. Samosas were cold in the middle. Were they fresh or were they made a few days ago and reheated in the microwave? My guess is the latter because they were chewy and not really crispy outside. Quite bummed about that.\n' u"Yes. Yes. Yes. So good. We wanted to find some good Indian in Ithaca and this happened to be the closest to where we were. I'm in love. I had the Kashmiri and now I need it everyday. You have to come here if you want good Indian food!\n" u'The food here is amazing I love the dal makhni (you can get a variant of dal makhni which is vegan or basically dal fry with black lentils) and muttar paneer. Also I think the catering provided by diamonds is amazing. I have ordered it multiple times and have always enjoyed their service.\n' u'Best indian place in ithaca!! Best buffet with lots of selection and good quality. The staff are the nicest people too!! I left my camera there and they ran for more than a block to return it to me.\n' u"We love Diamonds. My husband would eat out here every night if he could. The owners and staff are always friendly and service is usually fast. We love the vegetable samosas and garlic naan which are our staples every time we visit. We've probably ordered every vegetarian dish on the menu by this point and we have not been disappointed. Notable favorites: paneer tikka masala dal makhani and any of the saag dishes.\n" u"Great food! I always get the chicken curry and Naan bread. They have a big buffet but the chicken curry is boned so I always order it off the menu so it's boneless.\n" u"Takeout can be a bit slow sometimes but even so the food is always delicious. The lunch buffet is kind of mediocre (bland food and not that great of a selection) but I suppose it's still a good deal for $8.50 per person.\n" u'Food was delicious!! I have been looking for some restaurants I am truly enthused about in Ithaca and this is one. The smell caught my husband\'s and my attention and we were not disappointed. Some might suggest the food take "too long" but freshness compensates for the time. Enjoy yourself people :)\n' u"Friendly  location and window lighting is great. Food is authentic for those looking to taste real Indian Cusine. My only suggestion for the owners is to remodel interior  this will attract more customers. And a little  traditional  music wouldn't hurt the ambient.\n" u"I try and never post negative reviews because I come from a restaurant family and I understand that sometimes things are just out of your control.  My experience today however was just so terrible that I just felt like I couldn't not say something.\n\nI ordered some take out and the woman told me about 20 minutes.  I arrive 20 minutes later and the food wasn't ready.  Completely fine I understand that sometimes things take a while.  20 minutes later still nothing no food no update.  I ask again they tell me that actually what happened was that their delivery driver had taken my food by accident and gone somewhere else with it but that he was coming right back.  Fine I'm annoyed but fine accidents happen.  20 minutes more still nothing no food no update.  I ask again they tell me that the driver is turning back now.  Turning back NOW?  I guess I looked sufficiently upset because they decided to remake my food.  10 minutes later they finally get me my food.  No apology nothing. At this point I'm really late so I hurry out of there.  The 40 minutes of buffer that I had built in to make sure I was on time had completely been eaten up waiting for this delivery driver to come back with my food before the restaurant finally decided to just remake it.  I get to my event about 20 minutes late with the food only to discover that they forgot to give me rice.\n\nJust never again.\n" u'This was the first time in my life having awful Indian food. The mix of spices was not in right balance and the vindaloo tasted like cheap tomato sauce. Some dishes were not cooked long enough for the flavor a to blend well. As Indian food lovers I am sad if this is the best Indian food I can find here.\n' u'Just ate there for the first time with a friend and I must say they have a fantastic Indian lunch buffet! The price was very reasonable at about $8.50 a person for AYCE Lunch Buffet. The staff were all super friendly and always ontop of things. I also enjoyed the fact that it was a very peaceful and quiet atmosphere. Highly recommend and will definitely be going back in the future. :)\n' u'This was one of the quietest restaurants I had ever been in. There were multiple tables of people but strangely somber. We both ate masala with goat and lamb and garlic naan. The service was quick and kind we asked for our spice level to be medium and it was a little less than that. I think the spice issue may have been miscommunication a hesitation on our part perhaps. Portion sizes were perfect we had just enough to take some home.\n']
125.Hal‚Äôs Delicatessen & Sandwich Shoppe,[u"A very well worn functional deli that does the classics. Not over the top but a pretty serviceable place. Dear Princess Sarah from NY NY...Hal's will survive without you. I suspect most of Ithaca will not miss you..\n" u"Hal's Deli is by far the best place in the World to get great Kosher Style Food but hurry because it is scheduled to close soon.  Mike and Jackie (Brother & Sister) Will take good care of you.  If you are like me always go for the Rueben Sandwich.  The Coleslaw and Potato Salad are exquisite.  If you like fries then go all out and get them with gravy.  To wash all this down then you gotta have a Dr. Brown's Soda. My particular favorite is the Celray or the Diet Cream Soda.  For desert a must try is the delicious cheese blintzes.  While you're at it why not take home some great snacks like their bagels rye bread or their great pickles.  Enjoy your meal!  Chuck\n" u'Great service.  Food is traditional greasy diner with a touch of Jewish deli.  Massive sandwiches and delicious breakfasts.  Great place for affordable breakfast or lunch in downtown Ithaca!\n' u'The service is great but the food is not. Do yourself a favor and just go to a coffee shop or bakery.\n' u"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. Friends and I were spending a weekend in Ithaca and decided to stop in for a traditional greasy diner breakfast. We walked in and were pretty appalled by how dingy the interior was but thought it would be fine if we ate outside. We were wrong. The pitcher of water the waitress brought out was literally covered in dirt. I barely picked at my food--everything was so disgusting looking. I seriously contemplated reporting them to the Health Department. \n\nDon't eat here. ever.\n" u'I ordered for the first time and the delivery man was literally yelling at me when I asked to clarify what he was trying to say JUST ONCE. He didn\'t say anything like "Hello Meg I am from Hal\'s Delicatessen and I have your delivery ready outside" He just said "did you order breakfast?" So this made me think that they were making my food and had a question or were out of an item- this was not the case at all. So when I said yes he mumbled something...... And I asked if he could clarify because it was really hard to make out what he was saying...... So HE YELLS at me. Not even Sorry there is an echo in your lobby. Not even sorry I didn\'t read the instructions from GrubHub to buzz the door so I knew he was there. It was a lovely "I AM OUTSIDE THE DOOR I AM OUTSIDE THE DOOR" \n\nIt was so rude. And I\'m sorry but customer service is what keeps customers. I really should have just walked to CTB and paid way more for a breakfast sandwich. I\'m so upset by this not even hungry anymore.\n' u"Probably my worst lunch experience in Ithaca ever. The Reuben I ordered was insipid and full of fat. More of a mess than a sandwich. Barely any sauerkraut. The chips were seriously stale. Gagging on fatty corned-beef was NOT what I had planned for lunch yesterday. Will not be going back again. \n\nWhen you walk into a diner or deli and there's no one there... that should be the clue-in. I should've just turned around and walked out. My stomach would have been much happier.\n" u"I ordered the Husband Hal's Special Sandwich (Liverwurst tomatoes Russian dressing) on GrubHub and had an absolutely disgusting experience.\n\nAs I was taking my first bite of the sandwich I felt this strange texture (I'm glad I didn't swallow!).  I removed the bread and lo and behold there was hair on the liverwurst... not just a small (potentially forgivable) amount of hair but numerous large strands of hair intertwined together... I'm purely speculating here but it almost looks like this thing fell on the floor picked up whatever hair was there and was then put back into my sandwich. The photo doesn't even do justice to how disgusting the liverwurst looked. I gargled my mouth with Listerine and I still feel like throwing up.\n" u'I ordered a BLT and it was the smallest saddest little sandwich I\'ve ever seen. They put just about the minimum amount of bacon possible without it just being an "LT". Really disappointed. If you order one of their sandwiches you\'re not going to get some big awesome diner sandwich it\'s going to be a tiny little barely passable sandwich. Won\'t order from them again.\n\nEDIT: And I just drank the OJ they gave me.. I can\'t believe these jokers. It\'s not even orange juice it can\'t be. It tastes like some sort of orange drink mix. This place is a joke don\'t do it.\n' u"Hal's used to be my favorite breakfast diner. However after going there on 12/09/15 I can no longer in good conscience eat there. It smelled like urine so bad. I should have walked out. The floor ceiling and tables are absolutely disgusting. They look like they haven't been cleaned in years. It's really unfortunate. We have to find a new clean breakfast place in ithaca. I hope they clean it up.\n" u'If I had the financial means to go to Hal\'s every day order my favorite items on the menu talk to the family and become a true "regular" I would in a heartbeat.\n\nDon\'t come here expecting the other fancy overpriced sterile serviced restaurant type food and atmosphere you\'ll receive elsewhere on the commons.  This place is full of yummy sandwiches and an awesome feel like you\'re back in 1970 with Hal himself.\n\nAnd the staff...the family that owns Hal\'s really holds the true obsession I have with their establishment.  I adore Sandy Mike and Jackie so much and I look forward to seeing them every time I come in. The singular time I got take-out from Hal\'s sweet Sandy looked at me and said "Honey we deliver too!" to which I replied that I insisted on coming in and visiting them in addition to my delicious sandwich! I have raced down the hill to go to Hal\'s for lunch in order to see Sandy before she leaves for the day in addition to her wonderful kids.\n\nSo come in order some coffee and a yummy breakfast or lunch (we like the Albanese Lawyers and the Reuben) and hang out with the gang.  And did I mention it\'s super cheap?\n' u'This place has charm. I felt comfortable going here for a brunch and it looks like the deli has nice roast beef cuts. Family-friendly. Our waitress did not come back very often but was friendly at all times. Potato pancakes were awesome as others have said. Coffee is free! :) Super cheap.\n' u"Their potato latkes (potato pancakes) are dare I say better than my mother's! Tasty classic Jewish deli food in Ithaca hurray. However their hours oh their hours. This place makes me wish I was more of a morning person.\n" u"The Greasy Spoon...That's what we call this in the office but you know what? Sometimes the greasy spoon is just the trick for lunch. This is a great classic type diner with some pretty amazing diner food. I usually get the Reuben grilled and it is always a good choice and the price seriously can't be beat. The fries are really sub-par and I wouldn't order them again as I feel like they are just store bought frozen deep fried french fries that I get from like...denny's...but the sandwiches are great. \n\nDefinitely would go back for lunch and I look forward to trying their burger!\n" u'While in town to visit Cornell we ate breakfast at Hal\'s on a brisk Tuesday morning. I originally found the place online when looking for someplace open early enough for us to make our 9 am tour. (Seemed odd that most places downtown don\'t open for breakfast until 9:00 right?) When I saw that there was a Jewish deli (we are here during Passover- the holiday of dietary challenges) and it opens at 6 am I knew we\'d found our place.\n\nThe food at Hal\'s was yummy (the raves over the potato pancakes are all true) and they even had a Passover menu. But the best part of Hal\'s is definitely the staff. Jackie made us feel welcome from the moment we entered. She included us in her conversations with regulars at the counter and told my daughter that if she comes back to campus she should stop in and say hello. "Remind me that you are my Maryland friend who visited during Passover and I\'ll know who you are" she said. I felt like we\'d spent the morning with family. Can\'t recommend this place highly enough!\n' u'The food is great the waitstaff are the owners and extremely friendly. Had the Reuben and am planning on making this a regular stop.\n' u"Here's a place that understands breakfast. Open at six AM cheery staff full menu and rapid service. They should show up in Yelp's breakfast section but they are doing just fine without that help.\n" u'Came here for a casual breakfast and was greeted by a very friendly and attentive staff.  They were all members of the Hals family.   \n\nThe portion was just right but you must try their potato pancake...  great stuff.   The price was good and the meal hit the spot.   \n\nThe best place for an earthly and home-made breakfast in Ithaca\n' u"Great deli food. I've been ordering from Hal's for a while now. The delivery is fast and the food is always great. Their sauerkraut is crunchy Chili is tasty and the hotdogs are as close to a dirty water dog as I've had in CNY! If you hate small deli or diner food......It is not a place for you. Inexpensive tasty and fast.\n" u"Crap food but it's uber cheap (cheapest in town?) and the waitstaff is awesome. The Reuben ain't bad either come to think of it and the potato pancakes are pretty special. \n\nI'm a fan. Expect to get what you pay for.\n"]
195.2nd Landing Cafe,[u"This little cafe at the Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport is a bit of a gem when it comes to airport food. Its basic diner fair: eggs bacon omelets and sandwiches but its done just as well as most of the actual Ithaca diners. The prices are also quite reasonable considering they are in an airport.\n\nHowever be warned that they are located outside of security. This means you can't get through security and then relax and enjoy your meal. You have to eat before you go through security and that can sometimes be a bit stressful if you cut it close. Still this food is a far better value than you will get at pretty much any other airport so make sure to eat here before your flight. You will thank yourself later when you aren't forced to eat the gross overpriced food court style offerings at your connecting airport.\n\nNote if they weren't located in an airport I'd give them one less star. They get a sympathy star because airport food is always so bad.\n" u"The poor man behind the counter was overwhelmed by the line of six people who all wanted breakfast!  He was obviously stressed out by having to cook the orders take orders man the cash register and deliver everything!\n\nI have to hand it to him for slowly getting to each of us but I didn't have much time to enjoy my breakfast sandwich because I had to inhale it while my flight boarded!\n"]
95.Cafe Dewitt,[u'Great little breakfast and brunch cafe that makes great omlets sandwiches and of course Cawfee! Seating is a little limited but well worth a wait.\n' u'Four stars for food and two stars for Service. \n\nSpilled coffee no napkins brought just looked at us. Coffee and water not refilled. \n\nHuevos rancheros delicious.  Special omelette with andouille sausage delicious. French toast with apricot ricotta delicious.  \n\nSweet lovely spot. Wish the servers were attentive.\n' u"So the pros first: coffee is always strong and good wait isn't terrible for a party of one or two price isn't terrible and it's a nice place to go for a quiet breakfast alone (there are plenty of small tables) \n\nThe not so great: sometimes the servers aren't terribly attentive. It took about 10 after getting my coffee for someone to take my order. Same with the check- after waiting for it to arrive I was waiting another ten minutes for someone to take it and bring back change. It was a busy Sunday but it didn't exactly make me feel taken care of. \n\nThe food- the specials always sound good and look good and they come out quickly but they're almost never hot- which is odd since the kitchen is so close to the dining room. None of the cheese in my omelet was melted today and my eggs Benedict a week or two ago was similarly lukewarm on stale toast to boot. \n\nI want to give this place another chance maybe try the sweeter side of the breakfast menu but really I would just be happy if my food was hot by the time it got to me.\n" u"I have been to Cafe Dewitt more times than I can remember. I love the savory breakfast and brunch - that I'd give a 4.5/5.\n\nHowever every time I or someone has ordered something sweet off the menu it has not been good. All of the sweet dishes sound amazing and look that way too - however they just don't meet taste expectations. This is based off probably 5 or more times ordering waffles pancakes or desserts. Each time no good. \n\nAdditionally there is one waiter there in particular that does not seem to wear deodorant or shower. He STINKS. Every time he passed or filled up our water I had to hold my breath. This did not help my appetite at all and is unprofessional and gross.\n" u"In the same building as the legendary vegetarian restaurant Moosewood.\n\nBut does not deserve to be on the same continent with Moosewood let alone the same building.\n\nIt is an all purpose breakfast and lunch place.\n\nThe positive feature about it (which gives it three stars rather than two) is that it is in a charming location -\n\nalong a basement corridor next to a cool bookstore cool hippie things to buy for your house stores and farther down a cool folk music guitar store with well chosen cds.\n\nSo eating there feels literary suave and countercultural.\n\nYou had better be anti-materialistic too - because the food ain't great\n\nA cafe au lait had old stale coffee and had to be sent back.\n\nA croissant was indifferent.\n\nSoft boiled eggs were boiled just to the point of inconvenience where the shell adhered to the egg making it hard to open while the yolk ran everywhere making the egg half inedible.\n\nService was nuisancesome - with the waiter asking several times if he could take my plate - even with my still-being-eaten-breakfast clearly on the plate - and him repeating the nuisance calls even after I asked him to let me finish before coming back.\n\n(For the record the restaurant was barely 20% full so it was not like he desperately needed my table.)\n\nThere has gotta be a better breakfast someplace else.\n" u'The two breakfast omelettes we had were quite good.  One featured hazelnut pesto and fontina and mozzarella.  The other was with chorizo and green beans.  The potatoes that accompanied the omelettes were excellent.  Fresh squeezed OJ is a nice option too.  Got there a few minutes before it opened on a Sunday and we the first to be seated so service was not an issue.  There is LOTS of signage noting that they are cash only.\n' u"No better than the average American diner.\n\nThe waffles were generic and lacked the subtle sweetness that an amazing waffle has. This waffle needed layers of added on fruit/cream to dress it up.\n\nThe bacon was really really terrible. Thick dry crumbly. Like a flavorless block. Little fat. So boring.\n\nOmelette was watery and doesn't come with bread. \n\nThe breadbasket was cute and flavorful but was tiny. Made for two people MAX and even then just a taste.\n\nThe place is terribly understaffed and a lot of the time is waiting. The venue is a bit dingy and outdated without Windows or charm.\n" u"The hot chocolate wasn't that chocolatey the size of the water glasses is obscenely small and the eggs are bland. Everything else was alright I wouldn't come back here though.\n" u"**Cash or Check only** they don't have this posted anywhere and we spent 45 minutes running around town trying to get the extra $6 in cash to pay for the meal. \nBreakfast ok service super slow but they are kind.\n" u'Came for Sunday brunch would come back!  Note - cash only.\n\nLong wait for a table and long wait for food probably because the kitchen is so small. Food was good overall - brunch specials added a lot of variety to the menu. \n\nBut omelette toppings are pre-mixed so no room for customization (i.e.: omitting the meat) unfortunately. \n\n*Correction: the omelette specials are not customizable; was informed that omelettes off the menu are customizable*\n\nOn the farmhouse breakfasts I was able to sub a small fresh fruit cup (berries banana apple) instead of the meat. \n\nRosemary potatoes are so good! crispy red skin soft and flavorful inside not too salty\n\nCornmeal pancakes would have been better off being called flapjacks. Blueberries and ricotta cream were a nice touch. \n\nThe jam - think it was cherry? - was delicious not too sweet and a little tangy. \n\nFresh squeezed OJ was tart which I guess is a sign that it really was freshly squeezed!\n' u'The service was SO slow and the food was not worth the wait. My friends omelette was served cold. Overall unenjoyable experience.\n' u'Surprisingly crowded for a Tuesday lunch. Perhaps this is because moosewood just down the hall is closed on Tuesdays. We waited about half an hour for a table and then about 45 minutes between when we were seated and when our entr\xe9es arrived. Everyone was very friendly especially the hostess who knew we were waiting. Fortunately we ordered the cup of soup which was really delicious. Nice depth of flavor. I got a spinach salad with apples and pecans. It was surprisingly underdressed and under tossed. It kind of looks like just a pile of spinach. I asked for more dressing which they graciously supplied and all the taste in the salad were nice. My dining companions had the Ruben and the salmon entr\xe9e and both looked really good. The space is kind of echoey- a lot of hard surfaces for the sound to bounce off of. I appreciate that so many of their foods are locally sourced and fresh. A nice choice if you are not in a hurry and no one in your dining party has a hearing disability\n' u"CASH ONLY! Food is very plain. The server was rude and acted as if he wanted to be someone else. They didn't tell us that it was cash only until after we got our checks. They have no sign except for very small print behind the counter that says they don't accept CCs. The server was rude about it and said we had to find an ATM to pay. During our ordering we even told him we were not from here... that was his chance to inform us that they were cash only. Will not go back. Try College Town Bagels... way way better quality and service!\n" u'I love Cafe Dewitt.. We have always had excellent meals here even when we went one day about 15 minutes before they closed and they still served a great meal. Their tomatoes chutney is AMAZING. Amazing I say!\n' u'Came here with friends for brunch. Service was slow but friendly. The food was absolutely incredible! I had an omelette with pesto cheese spinach and tomatoes. It was easily one of the best meals I have eaten all year thus far. I would come here again.\n' u"This place is seriously AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!! It's truly a nice little hidden gem. It's located inside the Dewitt mall which can make it a little interesting to find especially your first time here. Now come prepared to wait in line. I often come put my name on this list and then check out the local stores with my friends while we wait. You might have to wait some time but trust me it is so worth it. The food is simply delicious you seriously can not go wrong - for real I've tried more or less everything on the menu and have yet to decide which I can truly call my favorite. PLUS most of it is local and fresh food. Overall I love this place (if you can't tell). It might be a little funky in that it is located in the middle of the mall but I like it. \n\nTip: Do not arrive starving - there is a line and you will regret it. Arrive hungry and then let your hunger build while you wait in line and then chow down once your delicious food is served. Will save you lots of frustration!\n" u'Nice little brunch place tucked away in Dewitt Mall. The huevos rancheros off the specials board was good though perhaps a little too heavy on the allspice. Prices are reasonable and portions were satisfying though not huge.\n' u"The food is excellent. The only problem is that one of the waitresses has OFFENSIVE body odor. She has some crazy hairstyle and I'm concerned some bugs may be jumping out of it.\nShe also wears a sweater that reveals her unshaven armpits. I will never return to this place.\n" u'Not happy with customer service. Forced to sit in a smaller table even when party was too big for the table.  Was not provided menus when seated.\n' u'The huevos rancheros were mediocre. There was a odd spice that left a lingering taste. A less than 4 ounce glass for water was served and not refilled.  Service was poor. Waitress acted as if we were a bother although all she did was bring a glass of watertake our orderdeliver the food and bring the check. Never checked to make sure everything was okay. There was no mention of the blackboard specials. I had to get up to read them myself. As much as I wanted to love this place as I like to patronize local businesses I was very disappointed in our experience.   It will be a long time before we consider going again. If we go back I will stick to the basics on the menu.\n']
144.Chili‚Äôs,[u'We had a great experience here when we were in town for graduation.  The service was great.  The food was very good - we all ordered different things and we all enjoyed what we got.  The fresh guacamole made at the table was especially fantastic and the chips they serve it with beautifully thin and crispy.  We are not in Ithaca often but we would definitely eat here again.\n' u'Good food prompt service nice atmosphere. Tip: Don\'t leave food untouched for more than 10 seconds; it\'ll be cleared away before you can say "I think I\'ll have a bit of the guacamole".\n' u"Came here for dinner with a lot of people since we are on a college trip. It was a fun place. And the burgers were good except the time from ordering and waiting for our food and drinks were so long. So that's why I rated it 3 stars when it could have been 5 stars if they let us have our foods and drinks quicker. Also the food and drinks were good as well. I had the classic bacon burger. It was good though so only if the food came out quicker and if they seated us quicker. And there was also one server with 5 tables. They should have more workers.\n" u"Drove up from Courtland NY to celebrate our 5 year old sons birthday. Waited over 1 hour to be seated while there was no wait for a table for 11 (which was empty and ready). Management said they wanted to catch the servers up so they won't be overwhelmed before they sat us. Finally sat and waited another hour to get our main courses. Appetizer Guacamole was awful and was returned and switched to red sauce. Staff was friendly but it appeared they only had 1 chef. Never again. Love Chili's but not this one. Would definitely not recommend. By the way our food came out COLD......\n" u"Absolutely phenomenal service from the staff and waitress. John the manager engaged us with a genuine interest in our dining satisfaction. His attentiveness shows in the cleanliness of the store as well as employee moral. Best chilies I've been to.\n" u"Only two reviews?  Shocking.  Or very telling.\n\nIn an act of desperation we went to Chili's over the weekend as the boy wanted a quesadilla.  By the way based on quesadillas alone I'm sure the 9 year old would rate this dump a 5.\n\nFor starters:  Menus smeared with food.  Disgusting.  Our server Lauren couldn't have been less interested in serving us.  Apparently she is allergic to eye contact.  She seemed annoyed that we were ready to order when she brought our waters.  We waited nearly 20 minutes for our appetizer although she brought my husband's side salad.  Isn't a side salad served WITH YOUR MEAL?  AFTER the appetizer??  She never bothered to come over and tell us why it was taking so long.  When the appetizer came (potato skins) they were overflowing with too much melted cheese (I'm sure this would be a plus for someone but not me) and so hot we weren't able to eat them right away.  Of course by then our meal came.  Another thing to piss me off.\n\nShrimp tacos were messy.  They used to serve them in these cool little taco holders in order to keep them straight.  These were slopped on a rectangular plate that was far too narrow and the tacos were soggy.  Husband ordered the Bacon Avocado Chicken sandwich - can you believe he actually expected that there would BE avocado on this sandwich!?  I mean - look at the picture I attached how dare my  husband expect to be served the same sandwich that they picture in the menu?  You know the one that actually is LOADED with avocado.\n\nAs a side note I totally eavesdropped on the table next to us.  They got their food and the waiter was back at their table before they could even get the first forkful in asking if they wanted dessert or a takeout box.  Seriously?  Also as we left he had dumped a tray of drinks on them with a flourish.\n\nI'm sick of this place.  Only giving it one star as the only good thing I've ever had from Chili's is a two-for-one bloody mary.\n" u'Great food! The staff is friendly yet not over the top! If you go sit at the bar when Jose is working. Awesome bartender and great conversation!\n' u'Love this place the ribs and the chicken are so good. The food overall is awesome. I love the atmosphere and it feels very comfy and homey.\n' u"So as a burger fan I naturally am inclined to try burgers everywhere I go an Chili's was no exception. Now I've been to Chili's in the past and the fact that I can't remember how the food tastes is probably not a bad thing...nor is it a good thing and so I went to try it once again with full thoughts in mind to make sure I remember how this tastes. So I got the Southern Smokehouse burger because come on now ancho-chipotle sauce crispy onion straws and bacon? That's a recipe for a burger if I ever have heard one myself. Needless to say the burger did live up to it's menu description and it was a pretty darn tootin' good burger. The burger was properly seasoned and the toppings were great. The bun was perfect sized and overall it was good. But when I was finished it didn't hit me as the best burger ever. It was a good burger though even a great burger. The thing that threw me though and the reason this is getting 4 stars and is now number 8 on my list is the Fries. The fries here were atrocious. Soggy and a few were room temperature. Maybe when they were fresh they were good but for the one time I went and from what this review is based off of I can tell you that the fries were way sub par. And fries can make or break your burger! \n\nOverall I'd probably go back to see if the fries get better but as of right now great burger bad fries. They should also make a Chili's signature sauce. TGI Fridays has the Jack Daniels Sauce Red Robin has their signature burger sauce. For Chili's something like a Mexican Barbeque sauce would be great something a little spicy maybe a little sweet. Something that would keep me coming back for it as it would be something I couldn't get anywhere else. I think that's what makes a place so great is that they do or have something no one else has. Maybe it's the bun the sauce a topping or maybe even the burger itself or the way they cook it. I feel like any one could make what Chili's made but like I said I'm going to give it a second shot and see.\n\nBtw happy hour appetizers RULE! Keep that happenin'!\n" u"I had not eaten at Chili's in probably 10 years. My previous memory of the restaurant was that it left nothing to be desired. I stopped by this location while on a road trip. The food was delicious and our waiter was very nice and attentive. I will definitely dine at Chili's when I get back home.\n" u"I like Chili's for a go to over fast food. Southwest chicken egg rolls and pork ribs. Yum. Happy hours and 2 for $20 that my budget can handle.\n"]
66.Asian Noodle House,[u"I am a long time customer. I been there like 5 years and just write review to them just because I like the way they keep the consistant and still keep improving in the tought economic. But they still serve fresh food with good quality and  fresh ingredient. Just love it!!\n\nAgree with the comment below about the server but I just impress about the overall quality and they consistancy because they change sever in this 5 years that's normal but overall they're great.\n\nI like red curry noodle soup kao mak gai yung chao fried rice pork with black pepper s17 (rad na) budhist delight and so many more.\n" u"It was a pretty good value! I was very full after eating just half an order. I had the Spicy Basil Noodle. It was just okay in flavor I thought it could've used more of a sauce. That also made the noodle too dry. It was almost undercooked I'd say. I did like the amount of veggies and meat though! I got pork and there was a fair amount. There was also just the right amount of veggies for the amount of noodles. This helped make the flavor better! I would've liked if it had more basil and spice too though.\n" u"Not bad for collegetown. Shares space with hai Hong so you can order from both I thought the dim sum from hai Hong was really good and authentic. I got the Singaporean chicken rice which was pretty authentic for ithaca. Service was 10/10 they're there when u need them but don't interrupt ur convo to ask if everything is ok.\n" u'Asian noods was definitely a staple throughout college. Food is mediocre at best but it\'s relatively inexpensive and comes out extremely quickly. I don\'t know if this is a good or bad thing (probably bad) but no matter what or how much you order it will be ready for pickup in 10 minutes. My friends and I once ordered 8 different dishes and sure enough "pick up in 10 minutes". \n\nService is alright. It\'s owned by a family and two brothers are most frequently working here. One is extremely friendly and talkative but the other always looks angry and wont say a word to you. The talkative one always jokes around and says your dish costs $100 when you go up to pay. I\'ve seen a couple people get really upset about it so don\'t fall for that.. It\'s a joke.\n' u'My family and I come here every time we visit my sister (she attends Cornell) and we absolutely love it(or at least I do). As starters something we always order is the chicken satay with the peanut sauce (drooling as I write this) and as an entree the pineapple fried rice (my absolute favoritee). Long story short - good college town eats folks.\n' u"I ordered seafood soup and two noodle dishes for my partner and I to share. The order came to $30. I've had more than my fair share of mediocre Asian food and enjoyed almost all of it but this wasn't even mediocre. My soup had a whopping 7 pieces of low quality seafood. The noodles were made with old vegetables -- I could see tell-tale mildew on the cut edges of the bok choy. Everything was bland. I definitely won't be ordering from here again.\n" u"I had BBQ Pork and Roast Duck with white rice. The dish was really good although the sauce was a little salty and reminded me of food back home. It's really nice to have an authentic South East Asian restaurant on campus. The price was not overly expensive either. Will definitely come back and try other menus.\n" u'It seems there was only one server on to take care of the whole place Monday Feb 17 around 8pm. Hungry students coming back from break.  The place was not even full but we waited for a long time to order I had to flag down the server who had forgotten about us. Due to language issue or whatever she couldn\'t tell us what massaman term in the menu was for a curry after we re-worded the question several times. \n\nWe ordered "crispy tofu" with peanut sauce. What came out were these ~1/4 pound giant blocks of tofu where the chef was feeling too lazy to cut them any smaller. They were 0% crispy look 100% white/barely cooked tofu. The entree was very poor quality/poorly prepared.\n\nThe basil noodle plate was decent but only had 2 pieces of basil in it so really lacked flavor. It wasn\'t about 2 it was actually 2 pieces.\n\nThe server never came back to ask us how things were.\nWhen I went to mention this all at the counter the clerk/runner person got an older guy who pretty much just told me I was wrong that the tofu was crispy--until they put the sauce on it.\nWell don\'t serve it with the sauce on it! Why not just put the sauce on the noodles?? I don\'t think I\'ll be going back soon.\n' u'I had the tomato beef stew rice and the taste is so-so. As a native Chinese I would say the dish is mediocre because of the overuse of artificial tomato sauce and salt. I would prefer a lighter taste for this dish.\n' u'On point spicy basil fried rice with chicken. Really great spot that always tastes good\n' u"Pretty good Chinese food which I was told I wouldn't find in Ithaca. This place offers a bunch of different options to put into your noodles and a bunch of different kinds of noodle to use. You can choose from rice noodles egg noodles udon and some others. My first time here I got roast duck with egg noodles. I'm usually not a fan of egg noodles but this place did it pretty well. The roast duck was nice and fatty just how I like it. I would've liked if you could choose from something other than chicken broth though. I also got some fried tofu and it came with its own little sauce tray. I was expecting the pieces to be smaller but they were still at a good size and didn't fall apart in my chopsticks. Today I got barbecue pork with ho fun. The ho fun could've been a little softer but overall the dish was good and the barbecue pork was well cooked.\n\nI love a bowl of noodles on a cold day and given all the cold days ahead of me I'm sure I'll be coming back often.\n" u'One work for the setting - awkward. I went around dinnertime and there was no one in there so as I was trying to catch my friend up on my life I felt like the whole staff was listening. Then when I went to order the language barrier was so severe I had no idea what they were trying to say. I got the Chicken Teriyaki and the chicken was pretty dry but the sauce on top was so delicious (the sole reason I\'m giving it 3 stars). I most likely will not be going back but I wouldn\'t refuse if my friends wanted to go. It was the epitome of an "OK" meal.\n' u"I used to like Asian Noodle House. The guy that worked here was really funny and he was actually fast about orders and getting food out. The new management is rude and slow and after my last take-out experience I decided to never come back.\n\nI ordered takeout from the restaurant went there in about 12 minutes after the phone call (they told me 10 minutes) and stood there trying to get the cashier's attention. She kept on ignoring me then telling me to wait while she got someone else's order and finally took her sweet time swiping my credit card. Two problems here: the restaurant could have either hurried up with getting my order or could have given me a later estimate so they can be ready when I got there.\n\nNever thought the food was great anyway. The MSG makes me dizzy after my meals and the crap atmosphere deters me every time. Goodbye Asian Noodle. I'll not miss you.\n" u"CHICKEN PEANUT SAUCE WITH NOODLES IS AWESOME AND BEST PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE WITH CHICKEN I HAVE EVER HAD (AND CAN'T SEEM TO FIND A SPOT THAT MAKES IT AS GOOD AS THIS PLACE). \n\nI absolutely freaking miss this place and would go back to ithaca JUST to eat here. The value of the food is ridiculous and fast and delicious. I fucking love it. It's not gourmet or fancy it's straight up awesome. service has always been friendly and takeout/pickup is always fast (10 minutes). i have never had a bad thing to say about this place the 30 or so times i've gone here. \n\nWHY DO I GIVE IT 5 STARS? \n\nBecause when you pay 7.95 for an entree item that could feed two to three people and it tastes 'good' or 'okay' you have to appreciate the fact you ONLY paid 7.95 for it. three people can have a FEAST for under $20 and still have leftovers (with regard to rice and noodle dishes). College students beware you'll get hooked on the value than the food though i still think the pineapple fried is the best i've ever had anywhere. by the way don't bitch about service or mediocrity when you're paying a pretty low price. the fast service and overall value of the food is good enough for me (because i'm a cheap bastard). \n\nPINEAPPLE FRIED RICE WITH CHICKEN Y U NO INSIDE ME!?\n" u"They serve Americanized Asian food that's somewhat decent and slightly overpriced for dinner.\n\nThe waitstaff are slow and seem annoyed if you try to ask them for something.\n" u"I have come here a few times to eat. Its good but sometimes the food doesn't feel authentic. One time I had it and it felt like they tried making me pad thai with spagetti noodles or lomein noodles. Either way it was okay.\n" u"Solid food weird cafeteria-esque ambiance and snappy service. \n\nIf you're in the mood for savory/spicy - the Spicy Chicken Noodle Soup - ask for it with extra chili sauce in the broth. Make sure you get the sauce caddy and add some peanut for a crunch.\n\nThe Pad Thai dishes are pretty filling as well - ask if they can put another egg on top of it. \n\nMost delicious are the Thai iced teas...although your mouth will feel like the inside of a Splenda packet when you're finished.\n\nThis place is not Asian fusion - more like Asian everything. I've seen Chinese Vietnamese and Thai food on the menu. Set your expectations lower than average and you'll be back for more. This isn't NYC Asian food.\n" u'A small fun noodle shop slanted towards thai.  Great service. Clean restrooms. I had basic noodles done very quality and wifey had curry rice spicy. Excellant. Appertisers were cheap and outstanding. And...serve beer! Wish it was open past 8pm.\n' u"I think this place changed manager. Horrible service. We were a group of six and two of us didn't have enough cash so left a 13%tip. The rest of us left about 15-17% and the waiter just openly insulted us for being stingy.\n" u'Do yoou want to get fat and have greasy Americanized Asian food? Then Asian Noodle is for you.\n\nReferred to as fondly as "Asian Nudez" (yeah I know that sounds wrong...) by my friends it\'s a good place to eat if you want cheap food big portions and don\'t care about your health.\n\nGet the pineapple fried rice with pork and you can\'t go wrong in terms of taste. The atmosphere is not great but no worse than really any other collegetown restaurant. The pad thai is okay if you like very Americanized Asian food. Honestly though I would only get pineapple fried rice with pork if I came here. \n\n+1 for Price\n+1 for Portion\n\n___________\nEverything else is just an eh because it\'s expected at C-town.\n']
11.ZaZa‚Äôs Cucina,[u'We had a great experience at ZaZa\'s Cucina. We were in Ithaca for family weekend at Ithaca College and wanted to try ZaZa\'s as we heard great things about it. The restaurant looked very busy (a Saturday night) perhaps due to all of the families visiting their children at college. In fact there were two other families we knew from Ithaca College who were eating there at the same time as us.\n\nThe reservation process was easy (via OpenTable) and we were seated immediately upon our arrival. The dining room is beautiful the lighting is just right (not too dark) and the sound level was perfect (helped by acoustic tapestries hanging from the ceiling). We had ample room at our table and never felt cramped.\n\nThe food was excellent starting with their sourdough focaccia bread served with a delicious dipping olive oil (Kalamata olives pesto and sun-dried tomato tapenade). We ordered a large bottle of San Pellegrino my wife had a glass of pinot grigio and I had Peroni beer on draft. For starters (antipasti) we had the Smoked Mozzarella Fritti and Caprese/burrata cheese. They\'re sized for one person so along with the bread there was enough for the three of us. Our main entrees were Pasticiatta (bolognese cream tagliatelle) and Lobster Ravioli. We wiped our plates clean!\n\nFor dessert we had the flourless chocolate torte ricotta cheesecake and tartufo. They were also sized for one person and we also wiped them clean! Unfortunately their "frother" wasn\'t working so we couldn\'t order a cappuccino.\n\nService was excellent and everyone was very friendly. It was a very nice dinner on a special occasion. We\'ll definitely return whenever we\'re in Ithaca NY.\n' u'The food was just ok (better than local Italian cuisines but not steller). We found the staff to be slow and unattentive (busy talking). When we arrived we were seated in a distant zone away from other guests making it a challenge to get to us. I remember asking for water and the bill a few times. We enjoyed the food but not the service.\n' u'The taste is pretty good. I would recommend the Caeser salad and the mussel appetizer. However a big no to the clams spaghetti since it tastes just like instant noodles.\n' u'Everything - service atmosphere price - was good but the food was excellent! We had the seared Ahi Tuna special clams over tagliatelle beet salad and Brussels sprouts side - all delicious. Wine was tasty. The only downside was the whipped cream on the side of the tiramisu didn\'t taste "real". \n\nWe will definitely return. \n\nNotes: Not really a place for young kids -m- it seemed more appropriate for couples/quieter groups (though we did go late)\nNot much for vegetarians/vegans without alterations.\n' u"My wife and I walked in and were pleasantly surprised by how striking the interior of Za z's Cucina is.  Just splendid.\nThe food was top notch.  I ordered the chicken parm which was the best i have ever had.  The sauce was very tasty.  My wife ordered the eggplant parm and she loved it too.\nAlthough I liked our waitress we were disappointed that there was little follow up regarding our drinks and meal.  The meal portions are large.\nNo bread was offered after we were shown to the table.  My wife had to ask for a soda refill and they never checked in to see if food was ok. However with that being said we loved tge food and thereforewe will return.We both recommend Za Za's too.\nLook forward to dessert at Purity across the street.\n" u'Like the Red spaghetti most! A lot of sea food in it. You will miss it. Very decent environment. Tasty bread before main dishes. Deserve the price.\n' u'This is my second visit here and I want to like the place. The service is excellentthe menu is full of great ideas but the food is not up to snuff. The veal chop was way over cooked and for $25 really missed the mark. The short rib with Gnocchi  had lots of fat in the meat and was stringy tasted like a pulled pork. I had the chicken parm which is probably the only dish the measured up. I think the chef is weak on the tougher dishes.! Too many good choices in Ithaca to try this again\n' u"Came for Valentine's Day dinner with my boyfriend and had a great experience! \n\nI would recommend getting mussels (appetizer) crab bisque and duck breast ( entree). Calamari was dry and lack flavor and steak was just so so. For dessert get tiramisu! I also had cheesecake which was a bit too sweet for me.\n\nService was great -- attentive and fast definitely worth a generous tip. Price was very reasonable. Portion size is big. Nice ambience and decor. Would love to come back again to try the pasta here!\n" u"Zaza's is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant which is a bold statement coming from an Italian herself. \n\nThe menu which features food that is fresh and prepared with expertise is quite extensive. The butternut squash risotto - just one of four risotto dishes - is out-of-this-world. The rice is cooked perfectly and is covered in a delectable creamy sauce. The addition of peas makes this entree healthy right? The pesto gnocchi - again just one of many gnocchi offerings - is another one of my favorites. I personally prefer my gnocchi to be dense rather than light and Zaza's gnocchi delivers the perfect balance between the two. The service is equally impressive.\n\nDo not be turned off by the exterior of this restaurant which is extremely underwhelming and which actually makes the restaurant appear dumpy. The interior is nicely decorated and professional.\n" u'Decent to say the least. I look for servers to bring energy to the space and ours actually took it down a notch.$6 beers in Ithaca seemed steep. $20 pasta dishes also felt steep. The gnocchi was extremely overdone and almost mushy. The parm was swimming in red sauce. Not our type of Italian restaurant - good luck.\n' u'What a great place for special occasions! I called in advance to let them know we were celebrating a special occasion so they sat us in a private secluded corner that was surrounded by candles which was a really nice touch. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. I was also impressed with the fresh pasta menu--we loved the mushroom tagliatelli and the special of the day which was a squid ink spaghetti with shrimp and arrabbiata sauce. Will definitely return next time we are in town!\n' u'A rather abysmal experience. \n\nThe food was exceptionally mediocre and did not taste that good. \n\nThe main problem was the service. We asked for our wine to be cooled a little longer for 3 or 4 minutes and the waitress forgot about it until I reminded her 10 minutes later. \n\nAnother waitress asked if I would like new silverware having used them for my appetizer... Of course I do! \n\nThis restaurant makes a poor attempt at providing upscale Italian cuisine.\n' u"Mixed experience tonight. Three of the five dishes ordered were top notch while the other two were subpar. My wife ordered two appetizers as a meal the PEI mussels and the calamari fritta. The mussels were cooked perfectly in a wonderful light broth - they reminded her of some she had in Loire Valley of France many years ago. The calamari the on the other hand was overlooked and too heavily battered. Quite the contrast. The kids ordered the Alfredo Parmesan and the spaghetti pomodoro. Both were large servings and were some of the best dishes we've tried due to both the flavorful sauces AND the fresh made pasta. Best kids meals ever. I ordered the pasta bolognese with gluten free pasta. The gluten free pasta was OK but the bolognese sauce was disappointing - not much flavor. \n\nDessert was also a mixed bag. Flourless torte and the creme br\xfbl\xe9e were very good. But we sent the decaf coffee back twice. How can you screw up simple coffee? Twice!\n\nThey also appeared severely understaffed that night resulting in pretty poor service (dirty dishes left on the table forever had to chase down the server for the dessert menu entrees took too long to arrive etc.)\n\nSo lots of potential but still some rough spots to smooth out.\n" u"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go in Ithaca. Their pasta and seafood menu items are always good. It is relatively pricey but it's a good place to go when you want to treat yourself or go on a date. \nThe inside decor looks elegant unlike the exterior of the restaurant. \nIt has a quiet and elegant ambiance.\n" u'I loved the Caprese salad with burrata. Their homemade bread is amazing and I love the Pasta with Meatballs. Awesome service as well from Wally\n' u'The staff here are very well trained amazing service. Despite some potential scheduling issues they worked with me to make it work. I had my birthday dinner here and they took the cake to the fridge lit it for us after we ate and even cut it for us and served it for us.\n\nThe food was fabulous and we all walked away with smiles on our faces. Thank you for the great people atmosphere and food!\n' u"ZaZa's is a nice Italian restaurant.\n\nWe enjoyed dinner here on a recent visit to Ithaca. I had the pasta special which was a rigatoni with a cream sauce and house made Italian sausage which was very enjoyable. My girlfriend went with the spaghetti bolognese was also good. \n\nThe only issue we had was the service was a little slow and odd for an Italian restaurant they didn't serve cappuccino.\n" u'Such good food and atmosphere! I went here with my boyfriend for our two year anniversary and it was so perfect. The staff was very kind and the live music made it all very enjoyable. The one thing I wish was there to be more dessert options but good news is purity ice cream is right across the road :)\n' u"My boyfriend and I went to ZaZa's to celebrate his 22nd birthday. The food was really good. The mini ciabatta rolls before our meals came with a delicious olive oil dip. We had some mussels for appetizer. It was very juicy and fresh. Then my boyfriend ordered the flat iron steak for entre\xe9 and I had the seafood stew. The portion is generous and the arraignment is beautiful. We then shared the espresso poured over vanilla gelato at the end. It was the BEST! I love espresso usually and the creamy vanilla gelato just added so much texture to the espresso. It was such a lovely treat! I wound recommend you to try it out!\n" u'Came here for my birthday.  Everything was delicious pumpkin ravioli I was too good to be shared pasta Bolognesi was incredible except in Bologna they would serve it over tagliatelle.  Mushroom pasta was incredible.  My son inhaled his NY strip.  \n\nThe live guitar playing added incredible ambiance.  \n\nThis is a great place to celebrate a special occasion.\n']
99.Mehak Cuisine,[u'This place has great variety of indian food.\nChicken tikka and especially the kheer is amazing.\nIt is reasonably priced. I had the lunch buffet here .\n' u"I kind of wish the paneer had more than six 1/2 inch cubes or the rice wasn't taken off the lunch buffet and reheated at 6pm.\n" u'This was where I first tried Indian food. The food was totally delicious! Our stomachs were stuffed.\n' u"I love Mehak! It is absolutely wonderful. I live relatively close-by and it's always super fast and easy to get an order for pick-up. Five stars because the food is amazing though I will make two notes: \n1. Tandoori meat to-go is 7 pieces of meat in a box with a side of rice. I'd recommend getting something else for take-out. Best time to get their tandoori chicken is during the amazing lunch buffet they have.\n2. Their lassi is a blended mixture served over ice which can sometimes dilute down the mixture. It's not something I've ever experienced before but is still good. \n\nI 100% recommend Mehak just keep those two tips in mind!\n" u"I usually go for lunch which is also when they serve their very popular buffet. I like the buffet both quality and taste are very good and the food is replenished frequently so it's fresh. However I would highly recommend their very good vegetarian dishes and I actually prefer getting an entree rather than the buffet because they are so tasty. I like the malai kofta aloo matar & saag paneer a lot. There is not much ambience but the food is worth your time and money.\n" u"You should hear me when I have a cough. You should hear Mehak.\n\nThat's gross though sorry.\n\nThis is a typical college town Indian restaurant. Very bland and very Americanized but everyone thinks it's just fabulous and full of spice. It reminds me of Taste Of India or something in Buffalo. It's white-people-Indian-food despite the Indian sounding name. That can still be really good though and it was pretty tasty.\n\nI don't think I'd have given it a 5 star even if it had been dirt cheap but as it happens it's pretty overpriced. So is Ithaca in general but these curries will set you back over $10 and for college kids that's steep. Maybe they have lunch specials or something but I think they should have some deals that make these dishes affordable on a daily basis to the poor underprivileged kids of... er... Cornell. Lol.\n" u"I love Mehak! I've been here many many times for lunch buffet as a well as for dinner in the restaurant (and take out). The lunch buffet is the best deal. If you go for dinner you're probably spending about $20-30 per person vs. $10ish for lunch.\n\nEven though there is no private parking lot I don't usually have a problem getting parking nearby.\n\nI wish they delivered but I won't penalize them a star for that.\n\nTheir lunch buffet is a great deal and all of the food is fresh and tasty. They always have chicken tikka masala at the buffet which is great because that is my favorite. They've never run out of anything at the buffet (at least while I've been there).\n\nThe service here is really good and you don't feel like you've been forgotten about.\n" u'Best Indian food in town. They are consistently good and I always love trying new dishes. They also have an excellent lunch buffet. \n\nMy favorite dishes are Madras chicken chole bhatura daal makhani and Bengan bharta.\n' u"Best Indian food I've had in Ithaca.\nThe waitress was lovely and the food was delicious. I really have no complaints.\n" u'The food is great here!! i always eat here when i am in Ithaca!\n' u"As others have noted Mehak is probably only a middling Indian restaurant in a bigger market but in Ithaca it is probably the best Indian food you're going to encounter. I've only even been here during the lunchtime buffet service so I can't speak to the regular menu and entrees--but the buffet is a terrific value and is much appreciated when you're bumping around town and are suddenly ravenous. The price is very good--you can get your fill of delicious Indian cuisine for about the same price of a combo meal at a fast food restaurant.\n\nI have found all the dishes to be excellent with special mention of the naan. Pretty much anything you get that comes with any kind of sauce is going to be heaven combined with that naan. Some of the dishes can be a moderately spicy (by Ithaca standards) so you might want to be careful if you're wimpy about stuff like that.\n\nI've always found the service to be friendly and efficient no problems.\n" u"I was surprised when I found out I have yet to write a Yelp review for Mehak. My colleagues took me here for the lunch buffet and I was in heaven. In general I am very against buffets because a) food quality is always meh at best b) the price for the food is always ridiculously overpriced and c) there are maybe 5 things out of 15 I would actually eat. Mehak know how to buffet. For $10 they serve between 12-14 main dishes 3-4 appetizers 5-8 side dishes and 2-3 desserts. Holy cannoli - the food is amazing. I admit that half the time I do not know exactly what I am eating as I am not well-versed in Indian dishes but my rule of thumb when going to Mehak for the buffet lunch: a little heap of everything. The result is you end up with the most beautiful and aromatic plate of food. Scoop it up with some of their bread and pakora and you are all set for an afternoon of worthlessness at work. I always have to strategize when I come to Mehak for lunch as my afternoons tend to be a wash - lots of time spent sitting in my chair trying my best not to fall asleep. \n\nIf you want to get extra reckless (as that is how I like to live my life) I order a Masala Chai on the side and for dessert I have just a few spoonfuls of rice pudding. \n\nA friendly reminder - don't overfill your plate. Wasting food is not cool.\n" u"Overall our experience here was positive. Delicious food (flavors were amazing breads were fantastic spices were perfect) quick & friendly service clean restaurant. They have a nice-sized vegetarian section of the menu with many dishes able to be made vegan. \n\nSo why not 5 stars? Three things: \n-Papadum & chutneys were not served ahead of the meal. I really enjoy this as part of the 'Indian Restaurant Experience' like chips & salsa at a Mexican restaurant so that was disappointing. \n-Dishes were on the small side but the price did not reflect this. The least expensive *vegetarian* dish was $10. We prefer to eat Indian 'family style' and the smallish size of the entrees made this more challenging. \n-We requested a bit more rice halfway thru our meal and were charged $3. Ouch. \n\nNotes: \nDishes can be prepared spice level 1-5\n-They have beef on the menu which is unusual.\n" u'Went for the lunch buffet most of the curries were a little gross-looking and not very flavorful. The only palatable one was the chicken tikka masala. It was nice that they had unlimited naan though.\n' u'very authentic indian food. i am a person use to indian punjabi food and had even problems sometimes in jackson heights. But here i found a taste i yearned for.IT was like back home india food\n\nInterior was good . \n\nwe took a buffet. 9 dollars a person with all you can eat is very reasonable to me.\n\none caveat was we were towards the end of the lunch and one of the items there was exhausted and they said that they would not replenish it.\n\nservice was prompt and polite\n' u'Oh God. Where do I begin with this place. There\'s a reason why this place is an almost weekly tradition for me. For a Cornell student who eats almost no vegetables throughout the week Mehak is not only a weekend delight after a long week of studying but also literally an important source of nutrition.\n\nFirst let\'s start with the naan. Scrumptious. Soft. Warm. Goes well with any of the sauces and foods that look like vomit and can\'t be differentiated clearly from one another. Don\'t be fooled; they ALL taste good. Get all of them. Seriously.\n\nThen there\'s the chicken. Oh god red plump almost boneless juicy chicken. Put those vomit-like foodstuffs over the chicken too. Or don\'t. It doesn\'t matter; you will be pleasantly surprised by the chicken anyway.\n\nFinally you get to the "dessert" section. If they have the "Besan" which is this kind of unbelievable tasting sweet chickpea flour don\'t bother. Stick with your savories. The Besan is truly such an unbelievable dessert that the first thing I do upon entry is to see if they have it. If they have sweet rice pudding you are in luck. Dribble that stuff over the Besan and you will be trapped there until closing time. \n\nMy piece of advice for eating here (yes you need advice to eat at a restaurant): Pace yourself. When you walk into Mehak you enter a different dimension where time travels differently from outside. An hour inside Mehak is really about 6 minutes. One monumental meal and three dishes later you find out hardly 10 minutes have passed and your digestive system will HATE you later.\n' u"I've been to both Sangam and Mehak multiple times and I prefer Mehak. \n\nOverall the price is fair the selection is sufficiently wide and the quality is there. I don't know what authentic Indian food tastes like but this stuff is delicious.\n\nI see other people have had issues with the service; I have always had great experiences with the service here. I think a set of sisters might comprise a good proportion of the wait staff not sure though.\n\nFood is great service is totally fine a decent selection good quality very fair price. I highly recommend Mehak's lunch buffet.\n" u'Just got some take out food from this little Indian place and -- what can I say? Definitely the best Indian food in college town! The naan was nice the daal was delightful the kofta was killer and the paneer was priceless. Far and away better than the competition!\n' u'The lunch buffet is reasonably priced. Predictable consistent and hot food make this a safe choice for fans of Indian cuisine. Most dishes have cream or tomato sauce base. A small selection of fresh vegetables great rice and other curry and chicken dishes. Recommended for lunch but pricey for dinner.\n' u"We are locals and typically go to the other Indian buffet a few doors down but they were closed.   So we ventured to Mehak.  \n\nI was disappointed that the paneer masala wasn't actually cheese but instead tofu.   The sauce was good.  \n\nThe chicken tikka masala was alright but I still like Sangam's much better.  \n\nThe one thing I really disliked is that as I was going to check out is that they charged my 6 year old the price of an adult!   If anyone has a kid...you know the eat a single bowl of rice and maybe a single slice of nan.   Hardly worth the stealthy $9.99 that is charged at this Indian Buffett. \n\nTo say the least we will not be coming back and if our Sangam's is closed we will just keep on driving!\n"]
30.Moosewood Restaurant,[u"Yummy soups and full menu great for the vegetarian. My friend loves it here so when we went to Ithaca for a weekend we had to stop for her.\n\nWe made a reservation in advance because there was a show at the State Theatre so we anticipated the places around Ithaca to book up quickly. That meant we had to get there early so it ended up being a meal between lunch and dinner.\n\nGo for the soup and the specials - they're all great seasonal renditions of meals with a vegetable savory slant. I really enjoyed the butternut squash soup they had available when we were there. Rich and velvety with a good balance of flavor and earthiness. The zucchini fritters are also worth trying as well as the sweet potato quinoa burger. We also shared dessert because who can resist chocolate cake.\n\nThe space has a casual cafe vibe. A good stop if you've never been and are dining with people with dietary preferences as they cater their recipes to vegans vegetarians and gluten free folks.\n" u"Pleasantly surprised given some recent mixed reviews.\nPros- all our food was delicious served in a timely manner with easy adjustments for the vegans. \nCons- super small menu which was a surprise. I Found the lighting garish & the decor in need of an update but that's so subjective. \nOur favorites were the fall salad (I was afraid the dressing would be too sweet but it was perfect) side of artichokes white bean dip w/pita tofu wings ( literally nothing like a wing but delicious if not a bit overly salted)\nChocolate vegan cake was huge and good!\n" u'Good vegetarian restaurant. Slightly limited menu at slightly high prices ($16-25 per dish). While the menu was limited everything that we ordered was fresh and delicious. We particularly enjoyed the Stuffed Filo Rolls which were the special when we went. \n\nAll of our entrees came with a side salad. Each person at my table got a different dressing (all of which are made in house) and they were all fantastic. Good vegetarian fare and a nice setting.\n' u'Came here for dinner on a Friday night with a group of six. We sat outside on the covered patio. I got the shrimp and grits which was phenomenal! The grits were more like polenta in form that balanced nicely with the chipotle sauce. My dish was filling despite its seemingly small portion. They know how to bring the nuanced flavors of vegetables to convert non-vegetable eating people in fans.\n' u'Maybe I\'m just spoiled by the abundance of vegetarian/vegan options in NYC but I felt my experience at Moosewood was subpar. The red pepper bisque starter and blackberry ricotta cake were the highlights of the meal and they were mediocre at best (well the cake was pretty good but it also came with mounds of whipped cream). \n\nFor mains we had the vegetarian feijoada (I\'m sorry but this is a blasphemy. Don\'t try to "vegetarianize" a traditionally meat-based dish; the only things this and a normal feijoada had in common were the beans) and egg bake which was basically a quiche that had brussels sprouts potatoes and cheese. Both were disappointing and tasted like something I could\'ve made at home.\n' u"Even as a Canadian growing up in the Maritime provinces I had heard of the Moosewood although to be honest I thought it was just a cookbook and not an actual restaurant lol  My wife knew that it was a restaurant and thanks (again) to the Yelp app we discovered it quickly and found it to be a great lunch spot when we arrived hungry in Ithaca.\n\nThe only bad news about the Moosewood is that they have a daily hiatus between 3:00 and 5:30 when they switch over from the lunch menu to the dinner menu.  We arrived a little after 3:00 and disappointed that we were too late for lunch and too early for dinner had to settle for much more limited bar menu (we actually had to sit in the bar area the dining area was closed).\n\nDespite our initial disappointment that we had arrived during their downtime we were happy with our choices from the bar menu.  We figured our best bet was to get a soup and salad then share.  The creamy savoury potato and gruyere soup with fresh baked bread hit all the right notes.  It was rich bursting with hearty new potato flavour and sharp gruyere like you would enjoy in a good fondue.  The fresh baked bread was warm and inviting with fresh butter.  I was unsure whether the soup would be substantial enough on its own so I helped myself to the great salad.\n\nThe house salad was brimming with fresh crisp veggies and lettuce.  I can't say enough about the miso ginger dressing (the bartender recommended it good call) - it was zesty silky and the perfect compliment to the freshness of the salad.  The perfect complement to the soup.  A fair trade iced latte (with organic cane syrup) with our lunch was perfect as well.  Prices seemed reasonable for what we ordered.\n\nOn our way out we picked up a Moosewood draft glass and a fridge magnet lol  We love being tourists when we are on the road!  We will definitely make another visit to Ithaca and time it so that we can enjoy either the full lunch or dinner menu.  Enjoy it if you go!\n" u'Pros: Food was decent and healthy. 10% off for all students with IDs. My server was nice. \nCons: Food was only decent. Not sure if coffee was refillable once I was served my coffee cake and the bill the server never came back asking me if I wanted a refill.\n' u'We were in Ithaca for four days and we ate all our meals at Moosewood. Well that\'s not completely true. Since we were in town for the Cornell reunion all our meals were included except lunch (and we missed a breakfast so we did hit up Collegetown Bagels) but still all our meals OUT were at Moosewood.\n\nDisappointingly the kids\' menu was dumbed down. I would have liked to have seen smaller versions of selections from the regular menu. Instead of going with the kids\' menu our twin 6-year-olds shared our food and between the four of us we shared three entrees - the perfect amount of food.\n\nEveryone really liked the butternut squash and kale latkes with maple crema. The black beans with quinoa cake and a fried egg were so popular at our table that we ordered it again the next day. The salmon burger was possibly my kids\' favorite though it was the least favorite of my husband and me. It was your basic salmon burger. The husband thought it was a little fishy. It came with apple fennel slaw which was just okay. The other entrees came with a house salad. I found all the dressings to be lacking especially the lemon tahini. On my second visit I discovered the best of the batch: creamy spinach basil.\n\nThe next day the tofu sausage lasagna was one of the specials. It was very very good. On the other hand the chickpea burger was the worst of all the entrees we tried over the two days. We attempted to cut it into fourths and it just fell apart. It was just kind of mushy and unremarkable.\n\nMy husband ordered the cucumber cooler made from cuke mint and simple syrup and it was the only one real clunker of the first day. Only the kids liked the cucumber cooler. It sat untouched and the server never asked about it. The host stand was also empty for a significant amount of time on this first visit.\n\nI ordered the chai which (I think) was fragrant of vanilla clove and orange. We liked it enough we ordered it again our second visit. We also capped one of our meals with the fudge brownie. Despite being billed as their "most popular dessert since \'73" it was not that special.\n' u"My sister and I are both Vegetarians and we had a great experience here at Moosewood. It's exciting just to have multiple options on a menu when you are vegetarian. Everything we had was delicious and the service was great. Our experience was so good that we stopped in the gift shop and picked up some swag. I get a little reminder of Moosewood whenever I drink out of my pint glass.\n" u"I was surprised this restaurant only has three stars on yelp.  As a pescetarian I loved it.  The food was amazing.  I had the Eggplant Mushroom Marsala special and shared the Fried Tofu Wings with my friends.  They weren't wing-shaped but they were delicious.  One of my friends had the Shrimp and Grits and loved it - the sauce was delicious.  I will come back next time I am in Ithaca.  Looking forward to trying out their cookbook!\n" u"Have heard so much about this place it lived up to its name! Great service. Delicious lime basil martini. Caramelized onion cheese dip. Stuffed eggplant. Bolognese. Cardamom pecan cake. Nothing disappointed. You'll forget it's vegetarian because everything is so good!\n" u'I learned about Moosewood through their cookbook. I was so excited to eat at their restaurant but was decidedly unimpressed with their food. It is really just okay.\n' u"Stop in Moosewood Restaurant if you're like me and were raised on dishes taken straight out of their many cookbooks. If you're looking for great service and an awesome experience maybe skip it.\n\nI was in the restaurant for lunch a few months ago and the food was absolutely fabulous yet the service was abysmal. We got our meals in about 15 minutes (I had some type of vegetable stir fry that was out-of-this-world) but it took almost three times that long to get our bill and cash out. I thought I was having a nightmare. \n\nJust last week I stopped in here during a work trip to Ithaca and sat in the bar area. Although they say you can come in and order off of a special shortened menu outside of traditional lunch and dinner times they won't pay any attention to you nor get you what you've ordered. The server described the tap list wrong (claimed they had a Ithaca Brewing Company beer on tap and they didn't) brought me the wrong dish and then charged me an amount that didn't equate to any combination of items on the menu.\n\nIt's a shame the service I received here has been so odd. I really don't consider myself someone who has super high standards regarding restaurant service but these were really bizarre experiences. I'm willing to give it another shot next time I'm in town because it's just got such a rich history.\n" u'I\'ve never written a review on here before and I honestly hesitated to write this because as a vegetarian who went to Cornell I\'ve always loved this place. However at the end of the holidays we came here and my sister ended up with fairly serious food poisoning. We also pulled a hair out of our appetizer (the three dips and chips).\n\nShe is a perfectly healthy 20-something who had been feeling 100% fine before dinner. We all ordered different main courses and soon after we arrived home she complained of stomach pain and then spent the evening in the bathroom. Her stomach continued to hurt and when she tried to eat the following day she ended up throwing up for hours. \n\nConcerned I called Moosewood to explain the situation and to see if they had any similar complaints. Though the woman who answered the phone was very polite she stated that she didn\'t think food poisoning could happen so quickly after the meal (she said it usually takes 24-48 hrs) and she mentioned that the restaurant doesn\'t serve any meat (presumably assuming that meat causes food poisoning). \n\nTwo articles in regards to that: \n\n1. "Symptoms from the most common types of food poisoning will often start within 2 to 6 hours of eating the food. That time may be longer or shorter depending on the cause of the food poisoning." https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001652.htm\n2. Fruits and vegetables also cause food poisoning: http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/top-10-food-poisoning-risks/?_r=0\n\n I recommend that the restaurant improve cleanliness standards and their knowledge of foodborne illness. I\'m sorry but we won\'t be eating here again anytime soon. If they\'d like to contact me to discuss further I left my name and number when I called in last week. Again I\'ve loved this place for years but felt compelled to share our recent experience.\n' u'It all started with the cookbook or maybe it started with a restaurant but the end result is a bit of history. Great place great staff got a love Ithaca.\n' u'Great place in Ithaca. There are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. They also serve cocktails with top shelf alcohol. The menu is extensive. A stress free very casual lunch. Highly recommend it if you are at Cornell SUNY Binghamton Ithaca College or the Apple Fest!\n' u"I think this is the only plant-based food restaurant in Ithaca with exception of Star Truck. I appreciate the simple fact that this is a plant-based food restaurant that's been in business for decades (I believe) and that when I come here I don't have to strain my eyes on the menu over the poverty of plant-based meal options at most restaurants. So you may think I'm biased because of my dietary choice but I feel those meat-eaters are just as biased in their tastes and their views.  Meat eating contributes so terribly to climate change and as far as I'm concerned animal-based food tastes greasy and leaves my mouth bad aftertastes. I wish there were more vegetarian/vegan restaurants everywhere.\n\nI was there for lunch the other day with an elderly lady friend - everything was good and tasty and the service was very pleasant.\n\nI had mushroom soup (delicious!) mushroom philo pizza (very good!) iced ginger tea (very very very good!!!!! made from fresh ginger with orange and lemon - I was so glad it was unsweetened other than very slight sweetness of orange - very pleasant on a hot day wonderful) and fudge brownie that came out warm with whipped cream and sliced orange and strawberry. \n\nMy old lady friend had lentil soup (v. good! she shared with me) orange-flavored vegetable sautee with rice which seemed good.  \n\nShe also had almond amaretto ice cream from Dennis' in Newfield -    I had a taste and it was really creamy and absolutely delicious with an interesting flavor. The best ice cream in Ithaca. I had one of his at Farmers' market and it was delicious! \n\nInterior is woodsy ... meaning furnished with all wood furniture. I really feel comfortable in the woodsy ambience. I love it! \n\nThere were people waiting around when we came (Saturday 1 p.m.)  Fortunately my friend had a reservation for us - which may be a wise thing to do - and we were able to get a seat immediately.\n" u"After reading several mediocre reviews of the Moosewood I hesitated to try it. Being from out of town and being vegan I felt I should give this iconic restaurant a try. I am glad that I did! My husband and I stopped in for lunch on Christmas Eve while on an excursion to the area. The interior is bright and cheerful with an expansive bar (always a bonus for me). I ordered a bloody mary that was simple and tasty. My salad was fresh and flavorful and the baked tofu was delicious. My husband's meal was delicious as well. We both left there satisfied and I was glad I didn't rely solely on the reviews! The service is pretty laid back so if you aren't in a hurry then you won't be bothered by it. All in all it made for a pleasant afternoon and I can now say I ate at the Moosewood Cafe .\n" u'Had a great meal here. Some really intersting veggie options-made eating "meat free" exciting!\n' u"I was super excited to finally eat at the infamous Moosewood restaurant. I've owned one of cookbooks for years. \n\nWe each ordered an entree which came with a fresh green salad. My niece got the farfalle with pesto which was good. I got the special vegetable mol\xe9 and my sister got the shrimp and grits. My mol\xe9 didn't really taste like a mol\xe9 to me but more like a ratatouille since it was pretty watery. It was ok but nothing to write home about. My sisters dish was the best of the 3. However as she was eating her dinner she discovered a long piece of plastic wrap embedded in her food. It was gross. The waiter presented the dish to the manager and they removed the charge from the bill which was the least they could do. I also got the strawberry lemonade which was very tasty. \nHighlight of the meal was shrimp and grits (minus the plastic wrap) and the strawberry lemonade.\n"]

3.Le Cafe Cent-Dix,[u'The chicken is the best meal I\'ve ever had!  \n\nI\'ve been to Cent-Dix about 6 times and I always order the Chicken.  It is amazing each and every time I come and it is far better than any other meal I\'ve had anywhere in the world.  Of course all the other food is amazing too.  But the chicken is out of this world.  If you think roasted chicken is too boring think again.  Every bite will melt in your mouth!  It may be a 3-dollar-sign meal $$$ but it a steal of a deal considering the impeccable quality of the dish.  \n\nThe service is amazing at Cent Dix and the atmosphere is nice yet casual.  \n\nReally great selection of wines and wines "on tap."  Probably the best place for wine in Ithaca.  \n\nA party of 5 will fit but it\'s better to have no more than 4 people.  It\'s a great place for date night.  I agree with other reviewers that if you don\'t want to wait it is best to show up when they open at 5:30.\n' u"First off I should preface this review with I am not a huge fan of french food to begin with but it was my wifes birthday so she picked!\n\n\nThe place\n\nThe place is very small and they don't except reservations so if you go around prime time except a wait.  It very cute if you are a party of two you will get a very small table they is about  2-3 feet from another. Not the greatest for but not terrible either.\n\n\nThe staff\n\nOur waitress was great she answered all our questions and was back to check on us every few minutes to make sure we had everything we needed.  She explained everything on the menu.\n\n\nThe food\n\nI ordered the Bibb salad to start and I must say I was really disappointed.  It literally was a few pieces of lettuce and weak flavorless vinaigrette supposedly with herbs for 7 bucks.  It had no flavor and not worth ordering.  For dinner I ordered the roasted chicken and was impressed.  Normally this is a dish I avoid because it normally is dry or unflavored.  However they did a  great job it came on a bed of mashed potatoes and green beans.  My wife had the Escargot which she loves however she said it was bland but not terrible.  For dinner she had the PARISIAN GNOCCHI which she said was ok. \n\nThe verdict\n\nI really cant recommend this place the food is at best average and our bill was 70 bucks for two.  I dont see the value for the food quality and portion.  As I said before I am not a big French food fan but I have been to a few others and they were way better than this place.\n" u"We tried a couple of things:\nAppetizer: beef tartare oyster \nMains: steak salmon chicken\nDessert: apple xx walnut chocolate xx pudding \n\nHalf roasted chicken and the apple dessert were definitely the two most memorable things. The chicken was so juicy and savory that I think it's one of the top chicken courses I have had. The apple dessert had three components the apple sauce crunchy bread (soft and moist underneath) and vanilla ice cream. They match perfectly and it's just not as fabulous if any one component is missing.  \n\nSalmon looked great so I got the salmon. But it was a little disappointing. It was cooked for too long from my perspective so that it lost the softness. \n\nThe chocolate dessert was also very good. If it wasn't the apple dessert I would definitely fall in love with it. Pudding is okay. \n\nAppetizers are okay. Not too impressive but not bad!\n" u"Came on a Tuesday before they opened so there weren't any lines and was immediately seated perfectly right by the window. \n\nTypically from other French restaurants I've tried food portions are usually quite small however the portions here were pretty filling. No complaints about that! \nIt would have been helpful if the waiter had given us a rough idea of how much food we were ordering but all in all it was good. \n\nI wasn't a big fan of the croque madame though because of the sauce mornay. It was too much and a bit overwhelming. I was surprised by how large the order was considering it was a hor d'oeuvres. The escargots were amazing and were placed into a delicious fluffy pastry. The pan seared salmon as well as the onion soup was great too.\n" u'A standard traditional French bistro menu that is executed fairly well.  The bread was good but as would be expected the butter needed salt.  The beef tartare appetizer had too much mustard and too little salt (If it were a real French bistro there would have been a little salt bowl...).  The steak of the steak frites was prepared well but the frites were mediocre.  The chicken in the poulet roti was juicy and well cooked but bland - it could have used some herbs and seasoning.  The chicken was served over pureed potatoes and green beans - these seemed like something that would be served with a meal during a conference in a hotel.  The French wine list was short and the Gigondas was quite good.\n' u'Best strategy: Arrive at 5 pm on the Commons and go straight to the bar at Viva Taqueria & Cantina.  Order a cocktail of your choice or 2 so that the next 20 - 25 minutes will be less agonizing as you wait for Le Cafe Cent-Dix to open.  Make sure to pay and tip the bartender immediately upon receiving your drink so that you can promptly walk out.  \n\nI found this strategy most suitable since Cent-Dix does NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS and I hate waiting in line in order to spend my money. \n\nImpeccable service delightful wine lovely dishes.\n\nSide Note:\nMy mother who is too frugal for CTB sandwiches let alone dinner out was not allowed to view the menu.  She looks down upon consumerism with an intensity paralleled only by the same "parenting" intensity of the one and only Amy Chua author of "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother."   I had to apply another strategy in order to circle around her money values.  Before we were seated I pulled our waiter aside for specific instructions.  "Do not hand my mother a menu.  I don\'t want her to see the prices.  We will order for her.  And hand the check directly to me."   \nHe nodded quietly.\nHer frugal way of life has no room here.  Nor was I going to allow her to shame and cripple our superb fine dining experience which was about to ensue ( and which she truly deserved) by glancing at menu prices.   \n\nOf course she tried all of the dishes with gusto and smiles . . . . starting with the fresh baked bread and fresh butter the onion tart (delightfully light with goat cheese and caramelized onion) roasted beets in red wine vinegar (juicy & refreshing) Bibb salad with champagne dressing (this bibb lettuce was out of this world buttery) smoked fish plate with crunchy toast points steak tartar with raw egg yolk delicate mussels in white wine . . . . followed by the entrees of flat iron steak & pommes frites (so much YESSS!!!!) cod provencale and pan seared salmon.    And she loved it all.  We were all too full and satisfied to make it a go at desserts.  In the very beginning I had ordered a specific bottle of wine the Vouvray which complemented the meal perfectly.  Throughout the dining we forgot about it as the dishes became the highlight.  I took sips here and there.  There comes that moment between the entree and the possibility of dessert where you sit with your wine glasses and just smile at each other - approving of this most satisfying dining experience.   The waiter returned to fill our glasses and it was the perfect ending. \nBack to my mother and her money values . . . . . \nOf course all her three children fight over the bill to show respect and of course I shut it down because I am the 1st born.  1st borns carry out specific family obligations throughout their lifetimes and there is no better way than to showcase that with grace focus and a fine french meal at the end of a family trip.  With calm & seriousness I hand the waiter the check with $300:  "No one argue with me.  I am the oldest."   \nHe nodded quietly.  \n\nAmbiance\nThe interior is welcoming and suggests to be intimate only as intimate as Ithaca can get.   Dress code is casual and not enforced and the service will still be on point.\n\nSolo\nOn my own I would walk up at 5:30 or any given time pray that they have one open seat at the bar and enjoy my meal with a glass of wine.  I would absolutely love that and can\'t wait to return.  \n\nPerfect Dinner Date Location! \n\nMy advice come early or come anytime.  Come with as many friends and family members so you can try everything. The wait is completely worth it.  But if you don\'t like waiting you are more than welcome to apply a similar strategy to the one I mentioned above - minus the tiger mom strategy.  ;)\n' u"This restaurant was our default choice because the line was too long at the other restaurant we wanted to go to. I am so happy we were able to get a table at this place. Everything that was served was perfectly executed. The gnocchi  was one of the best dishes I've ever had.\n" u'Excellent French food with different specials each night. Unique delicious cocktails. Our waitress Anna was fabulous and very helpful. Highly recommended.\n' u"We found this place to be very inviting although they were crowded. The hostess was ablebto get us seated rather quickly and offered us a beverage right away. We found the offerings to be quite interesting from tmsteak tartar to escargo. The appetizer was just ok to us although the beets were vibrant with the cilantro the celary root salad and curriedcauliflower were just bland. The cocktails were awesome!!!! Hands down my fav part of the meal. I ordered the french style chicken breast which was cooked to perfection (crispy on the outside) and buttery tender on the insider. My guy had the beef which was fall pff the fork tender and flavorful. \nOverall we're giving this place a 4 but not because of quality or quantity or lack there of but because we wanted foie gras and it was only served one night a week! How can you do french food without a little spread of heaven! Also because the oyster appetizer really lacked the oyster as it just taste like crucht bread crumbs which was disappointing.\n" u"We spent a truly magical date night at Le Cafe Cent-Dix.  The dark lighting the professional service and the FOOD.  Oh my dear the food ...\n\nWe started with a goat cheese and onion tart that was so delightful I couldn't help but close my eyes to savor every moment.  It was served with bib lettuce the perfect fresh crisp side to complement the warm creamy goat cheese.  This tart was absolutely the highlight of the evening.\n\nSadly their plate of the day was sold out so I went with the salmon.  This was delicious and cooked perfectly but nothing particularly special as I can get a good salmon at most restaurants.  My date had the gnocchi which was more unique and very very good.\n\nFor dessert we had a pear tear with shaved almonds.  Out of this world.  Our server recommended we pair it with a small glass of dessert wine.  I would not normally spend $11 on a small glass of dessert wine but her recommendation was spot on: great pairing with the dessert.\n\nOverall a delightful meal and perfect evening.\n" u"We arrived at 5:25 on a Saturday to be there when they opened at 5:30 and there was already a line out the door. There are about 15 tables so make sure you're in line to get a table. Or arrive about 6:40 for the turnover. \n\nThe service was great. The bread is delicious (I always think it's a good test for a good restaurant!) We ordered the escargot (8/10) that came in a filo dough that was delicious! Also had the ch\xe8vre and onion tart (6.5/10) and French onion soup (9/10). Then for entr\xe9es I had the lamb and thought it was delicious (9/10)!! My date had the chicken and thought it was yummy but nothing special (7/10) in super buttery mashed potatoes. \n\nWould do again (but wish that they took reservations!)\n" u'Cafe Cent Dix is by far the best french restaurant in Ithaca. The quality of food and the experience here is what I would expect out of an infatuation-rated restaurant in NYC. \n\nFood: 5/5\nRoasted beets with sherry vinaigrette: a nice simple starter with lots of flavor\n\nfrisee salad w/lardons and a poached egg: one of my favorite "salads" to order and done perfectly. I dont know to what degree this is a salad considering the amount of egg and pork fat is in it but who gives a shit its delicious as fuck.\n\nRoasted Half chicken: Crispy on the outside juicy on the inside. Rick mashed potatoes and green beans tie this meal together completely. \n\nService: 3/5\n\nMy only gripe about my experience here was that we had to wait so long to be seated and it seemed like our party was temporarily forgotten about in the bustle. I almost considered leaving at one point because it took so long and was getting upset but I am glad I stayed it was well worth it. Besides that service was fine albeit somewhat slow.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\n\nits a mix of mostly older Ithaca locals and couples here - very few students. It gives the restaurant a somewhat slow feel to it. besides that it is decorates very tastefully. The mirrors on the wall give it a nice touch.\n' u'I found the restaurant to be mediocre and very overpriced with spotty service.  Twice my drink sat on the bar for nearly fifteen minutes before the waiter even thought of delivering it arriving twice flat and watery.  The bread was ok but should have been better.  My entree the steak frites arrived cold and cooked wrong.  I ordered medium and it came very rare.  It was a tiny 8oz of cold undercooked cheap shoulder steak and $28.  The au poivre sauce was thin and scant and contained no peppercorns.  The undercooked shoulder was so chewy I had to choke it down.  The frites were very good.\n\nMy goodness people a steak au poivre is 12oz of strip or ribeye pepper encrusted pan seared with a cognac deglazing and a rich green peppercorn sauce.  Let me know if you ever want to offer that.  Until then I feel my money is better spent elsewhere.\n' u'This is my favorite dinner place in Ithaca. The menu has exactly the right number and assortment of dishes and excellently prepared. The waiters are gracious and the wine list both interesting and complements the food ideally. Their bar also serves up some lovely and beautifully balanced cocktails some of which are "retro" and have a long history.\n' u'Food was very well-prepared. Service was very good. Prices are higher than the Ithaca average but comparable to other similar restaurants. Decor is nice - feels like a cozy place to be. Overall very good - would go again.\n' u'I\'ve been here several times over the past few years none of which have I had to wait -- perhaps because I went in on a weeknight and quite early. I think that over the past several months this location has gained so popularity though -- kudos it\'s well-deserved. \nAmbiance is somehow both upscale and still bistro-casual - -the dark wood and pretty antique mirrors and prints contribute to that combination. It\'s small and intimate -- which is great in some ways but on the other hand the two-top tables are placed quite close together near the front area -- meaning noisy diners at neighboring tables can get annoying -- you inevitably can hear each other -- if you want privacy and quiet. (This set-up is more common in NYC - -not so much in Ithaca.) \nFood is extraordinary - there is very little to fault it. I have to admit that as a vegetarian -- don\'t hate me and there are a lot of us in Ithaca or I wouldn\'t even mention it -- I am un peu disappointed that there are so few entree options available  -- usually it\'s the pasta/gnocchi dish Otherwise you can do some combination of the very light "premieres" one or two of the salades the pommes frites.  I wish there were just one or two more substantial options. What do I expect? Well and I\'m probably going to sound like a major ass here but as a student I lived in France and so I know it\'s possible to have real quality bistro-esque French food that does not contain meat. The selection of wines and other drinks is pretty much impeccable. (I love the wines on tap -- anything on tap really.)\nService is exemplary -- just really professional and you know upscale without being snobby fussy invasive overly rushed or cold. Other restaurants in the neighborhood could learn from them; it\'s what you expect but sometimes don\'t get in determinedly casual Ithaca.  \nCent-Dix is more expensive than befits an "everyday" restaurant for most people but what you get is not just a meal but an experience one that\'s consistently high-end and comfortable time after time. I\'m going to give le Cafe Cent-Dix five stars but if I could I\'d give it 4.5 due to the vegetarian thing.\n' u"Ithaca has very few redeeming features. One of them is the natural abundance and the other is Cafe Cent-Dix. \n\nI will forever remember trudging down the hill from East Ithaca with my partner (and walking back up slightly intoxicated) to experience the only fine dining Ithaca has to offer. The service was impeccable every dish I had was incredible (duck confit creme brulee red wine) and for an hour or two I could pretend I wasn't living in a forsaken broken central New York town.\n" u'This is definitively the best dining experience Ithaca has to offer. Every menu item is superb and well conceived.\n\nStarting with the beginning they don\'t accept reservations. This is a little aggravating especially when one has to wait in the rain due to very limited bar space. The wait is worth it as the food is great.\n\nWith the exception of our waitress the service is also excellent. The maitre d was very organized polite and apologetic for the wait. The employees who served our food were very kind. \n\nOur waitress was odd bordering on extremely rude. She was very put out that we wanted bottled water (I really dislike the local water) and seemed amazed that we wanted 2 bottles for a larger table. I spotted her rolling her eyes as she was explaining to another server she\'d need another bottle. She never asked us if we wanted more bread even though she knew we had been waiting for an hour and she also avoided eye contact between the time she dropped off the bread and the time our food was brought out to us by a well mannered server who asked if we would like some and promptly brought it to us. We tried to get her attention several times but she was very efficient at ignoring us.\n\n We asked to see the dessert menu and when we said we\'d like to order she interrupted me as I was speaking to say "don\'t you want to let everyone finish their meal before ordering dessert?" Everyone but one person had finished their plate and that person had picked out dessert we were also going off of the assumption that the dessert doesn\'t instantaneously apparate and didn\'t want to hold up the table longer as there were still parties waiting out in the weather but we are the rude ones? She also then walked away angrily but came back a few minutes later and slid our dessert menus off the table without a word to us as if we had bothered her by not mailing them to her or something.\n\nOur table had the steak-frites and the gnocchi which were both excellent. They give you a generous portion of fries and good portions all around especially for the price. I had the creme brulee for dessert which I loved. We also got an almond pie type of dessert which I didn\'t try but was well received. I would say it\'s more of an american/french cuisine but I really enjoyed it.\n\nOverall everyone we interacted with other than our server was extremely pleasant and prompt. The ambience is really nice and the food is certainly worth it.\n\nIf they were to improve I would suggest offering reservations restructuring to allow ample waiting room for inclement weather (this is Ithaca) and maybe replacing that one waitress.\n' u'Our dinner was perfection in every way from the ambiance to the wait staff to the food and wine list!  While the food is beautiful on the plate one also appreciates the attention to detail that the kitchen staff has taken to prepare each dish that is ultimately delicious!\n\nThis is a restaurant that Ithaca has been waiting for!  The fact that they don\'t take reservations is just an "Ithaca thing" so please don\'t hold it against them... Please also try Mercato next door as it\'s basically the same restaurant in an Italian kind of way.\n' u"Wish this place served brunch! But it's dinner only. The prices are a bit on the high end but the food is good -- especially by Ithaca standards. The service was attentive which was nice. Sounds like the place can get very busy but I would definitely check it out if you are in the Commons.\n"]
77.Joe‚Äôs Restaurant,[u'Enjoyed a very traditional Italian dinner at Joes on a visit to Ithaca. We had the bottomless salad bowl for 12 bucks with a Italian dressing. We also had the seafood diablo and Eggplant parm. All very good. Ask for some extra red sauce and they charged 2 bucks crazy!! I am giving a three stars more for the pricing which was 100 for two entrees and tip. Good food good service but pricing is a bit high.\n' u"It's finals week and my dad had some free dinner event here and he took me so I wouldn't have to cook amid my finals. The chicken Parmesan was maybe the most tasteless thing I have ever put in my mouth. I was starving but it was still all I could do to not spit it out. My dad got served the wrong order but didn't even realize it until he was halfway through because it was just a blob of food. I overheard another lady who was vegetarian and got served the wrong order containing meat. \n\nTwo easy options would have been better:\n\n1. I stayed home and cooked for myself because there is a 100% chance that I could have made something better. \n2. I didn't eat at all and saved myself from that meal and had more time to study. \n\nThanks for making my finals week a little bit worse.\n" u"I wondered when there was only one other customer. My stromboli had uncooked tomatoes and banana peppers with to much cheese. My wife's lasagna was all cheese too. Sub part Italian food. Nice waitress. We won't be back.\n" u"Stopped in for dinner while coming back 'home' for a visit.  Johnny's has been around forever and it's great to see it is still going strong.  The interior was bright and inviting and the service was friendly throughout our meal.  Definitely a throwback Italian restaurant menu.  I went with the Manicotti and was not disappointed.  The portions were good sized and heavy on the cheese (just how I like it but if you are not a cheese fan well...).  Overall we enjoyed a nice family meal spanning 3 generations at a place that has been an Ithaca staple for decades.\n" u"Stopped here on the way thru town on business. Glad they were opened on Monday night. Ordered wings as an appetizer. They were half price because I sat in the bar. Wings were very good. Served w blue cheese and celery. Ordered pizza thin crust w sausage mushrooms and caramelized onion. Sauce was not noticeable. Pizza had generous amount of cheese. Mushrooms were fresh & sausage was good. Dough was not great. \nService was excellent friendly & attentive. I have not been here in a while and I'm glad I stopped in.\n" u"All I hate to say this but there probably isn't a good Italian in Ithaca and if there is it's certainly not Joe's. Ithaca is a mini-NYC when it comes to cuisine-diverse and delicious regardless of the plate. Joe's has an inviting atmosphere with good service easy access off Route 13 reputable service with commujity tenurebut...but... the food is inconsistent and sometimes well most times...feels like you opened the freezer compartment and kicked on the microwave for 3:30. Somebody in this town has got to recruit a good NYC chef and open an Italian masterpiece.\n" u'I have eaten at Joes multiple times over the years. My family had a wedding reception and the restaurant set up tables for a large party. The food and service was excellent. Salmon steak and ravioli was to perfection. The desserts were excellent and I believe they may have been prepared at the neighboring Ithaca Bakery shop next door. I have no complaints other than the small parking lot.\n' u"We were looking for a place open on Christmas for a good meal (hopefully something besides a Denny's).  We turned the corner  and lo and behold Joe 's was open !  Joe's is kind of an old-school Italian restaurant that's been open for 90 years. We were immediately met with a very friendly host and were seated right away.  The host told us this was their ninth year of being open on Christmas Day. \n\nWe lucked out at the time we arrived because numerous people came in behind us and either had a reservation or had to wait for a table.  \n\nI had the vodka chicken and it was delicious. The homemade breadsticks were a nice complement too. Considering they had to work on Christmas Day they had a very friendly staff too. \n\nIt looked like they had a special limited menu for Christmas so I'll definitely go back on a friday evening and order off the regular menu and try something different.\n" u'I went with two friends after I\'d been craving Italian food for two weeks. I had the gnocchi carbonara my one friend had the chicken parmesan and the other linguini with white clam sauce. \n\nOne of my favorite Italian dishes are fried ravioli which are a St. Louis MO favorite. These were some of the best I\'d had east of the Mississippi. \n\nUnlike most linguini with clam sauce which can be over powered by garlic or the white wine this was perfectly made and you could taste the clams with every bite. \n\nThe chicken parmesan was "super delicious" and a "9.5/10". \n\nMy gnocchi carbonara while the gnocchi were a little crunchy was delicious. I can\'t say that a little bit of crunch should detract from the five stars. \n\nWe had a lovely waitress who was gracious and friendly. \n\nWhen a place has been around for 84 years they have to be doing something right.\n' u'Good was unexpectedly "not good". Chicken Parmesan was soggy and tasteless; London broil or flank steak was inedible and had an off flavor. Bruschetta was good. Salad was 100% iceberg- yuck. \nWon\'t be going there ever again.\n' u'My boyfriend and I were driving through Ithaca on our way to our vacation rental - could not have been more pleased that we stopped here for lunch.  Food was excellent as was the service!\n' u"Came here with my boyfriend for his birthday. Service was friendly and food was good. Only reason they are getting three stars is because they brought out the wrong entree for me. However it was fixed quickly. Their arrabbiata sauce is no joke though. If you can't handle spicy food don't order it.\n" u"So the Columbia Fencing Team just had the pre-competition dinner at Joe's the night before the opening of the 2016 Ivy League Fencing Championships. I have been to Ithaca about 20 times over my 36-year history at Columbia. I have had the honor of eating at Joe's several times with many teams including Women's Soccer. It's a basic Italian menu with good service and attention to getting the food out quick to a large group. Plenty of room for a team. Private enough that the team could relax be loud laugh and not be disruptive to the local clients. Easy in and easy out even with a busload. Unlimited bread sticks salad drinks and pasta. The grilled chicken and Chicken Parmesan are both good and filling. If based on the food this is the beginning of a great weekend!\n" u'I got delivery. I\'d give it like 3.5 stars on taste. But the issue is the quantity they gave me. Honestly I laughed when opened the container. I\'m not the type to call back and complain so i just ate it. My hope is that someone from the restaurant reads this shitty review and makes a modest change because it would be easy and the impact on cost would be non existent. .  Chicken parm I got. Like seriously just pound the chicken flatter with a tenderizing mallet and and give the consumer at lease the illusion of thinking they are getting something worth their money. The piece of chicken was a hair under the size of my little fist - I have little hands like Donald Trump so it was really small. The amount of pasta I think could probably feed a newborn. I think the pasta was gone in like 4 bites. I\'m making me sound like a huge fat ass. But i\'m not. Quite the opposite. 5\'10" foot tall 165 lbs. Google it. My wife got a flatbread sandwich with fries for 13 dollars. It was also an undersized sandwich that would be like 8 or 9 bucks at a normal respectable place. Tasted great in fact. But certainly not worth 13 bucks. Fuck these assholes.\n' u'Uninspired "Italian" food that uses Kraft parmesan cheese. Flat-bread sandwiches were okay but overpriced and at the height of lunch service the spacious dining room was completely empty. They need to add some zest to the menu and the location. Perhaps a diner-style restaurant with fresh food and twists on Italian flavors? Handy location though - a block up from Ithaca bakery.\n' u'Love the new renovations! The food was dynamite from the amazing salad and delicious breadsticks to the Alforno and finalized with the best mud pie ever! Thanks to Kristen for excellent service We look forward to our return to Joes!\n' u"I hadn't been here in 15 years and the food held up. Ordered flatbread sandwiches which are essentially small pizza shells rolled in half and stuffed. Great French fries and the meatballs for my sandwich were fresh and tasty.\n" u"Punched food into the GPS and ended up driving by this place. So we went in! My hubs and I were in town for interviews and were starving afterwards. As soon as we walked in I noticed this terrible smell. I couldn't quite place it urine? Soggy dog? Ugh it put me off! I really needed to go to the bathroom so we stayed--otherwise I would've bolted.\n\nI looked at the menu and I was like uhhhh NO. But again we were already seated and were the only folks in there. I ended up getting something off thier express lunch menu-meaning all this stuff is sitting under lamps back there I'm sure. I got chicken tenders and fries the hubs the meatball sub. \n\nEverything was fine not good not bad. The setting is beautiful on the inside!!!! This is definitely a place you take someone you want to impress. The wait staff looked like they should've been dressed better for a place like that. I felt under dressed too. But again it was almost 3 on a Wednesday afternoon--EH.\n\nI wouldn't seek this place out again.\n" u'I don\'t know why certain people dislike this place so much. (I don\'t trust people who use the word "hubs" so let\'s begin with that premise - forgive me.) I am a vegetarian which admittedly limits my scope. But if you want hearty basic unpretentious Italian-American food just give it a try! It\'s not fancy and the prices --let\'s say "something for everyone" -- reflect that. I think it\'s a safe bet for kids and for when your parents are in town. It\'s also good for a quick week-night meal. Again no pretense but a decent non-overreaching menu and a pretty nice location with good parking options and a nice un-crowded ambiance. Their pizza is super! One thing I\'d change is lose the iceberg lettuce in the salads and so okay..it would help if somebody\'d tell them there\'s a drought in California and a locavore movement in CNY -- which doesn\'t help in the dead of winter I realize...Still Joe\'s is much better than Olive Garden and /but all over the U.S.A. people are lining up and waiting over 45 minutes for that brand of corporate over-priced mediocrity and tackiness. (Just try it!)\n' u"Made a reservation for eight people a week ago and everything went very smoothly. The wait staff was accommodating and helpful (and good to children) and their level of attention is ideal; not pesky but there when you need them.\n\nA few of us ordered chicken parms and they were wonderful! The calamari was perfect and the breadsticks were warm and tastefully seasoned. Also if you haven't tried their Italian dressing then you're missing out! It's sweet tangy and thicker than most store-brands. I would buy it for home use if possible!\n\nWe all left happy - both with the food AND drink selection ( they have Ithaca's Caskazilla on tap!). 5/5\n"]
192.Mattin‚Äôs Caf√©,[u"Working long ours on the Engineering quad I often find myself eating here. It's not my preference by any means but who wants to walk across our hilly Cornell campus in the snow or rain. They have standard deli breakfast and hot sandwiches along with grab and go sushi salads and fruit cups in refridgerators. They also have grab and go baked goods and hand fruit in the non-refridgerated section. The food is reasonably fresh just uninspired. There isn't much a restaurant can do without a kitchen but the staff is really fast. Excellent customer service.\n"]
128.Mate Factor - Temp. CLOSED,[u"This cafe run by the Twelve Tribes a Judeo-Christian community combines wholesome food and a peaceful ambiance. Music and voices are kept soft and minimal. Natural wooden forms dominate the interior in keeping with the decidedly earthy-crunchy aesthetic of the small funky city outside. The ordering of food here is a no-frills affair - you come up to the cash register pick your meal off the unchanging list of options on the wall and pay right then. Your order is clipped to a laminated drawing which is sent off along a sort of clothesline pulley system down the length of the cafe to the back where the food is assembled. The tofu-avocado wrap my personal favorite is consistently fresh filling and generous without being overwhelming.\n\n(Edit: Mate Factor has been closed for about a year as of March 2017 - it's being converted to a Yellow Deli a 12-tribes-run restaurant you can find across the country.)\n" u"Ahh as an alum finally made it here after missing all the open business times during the school years. Their hours are sporadic at times so make sure you check before coming by. \n\nFriend and I ordered the waffles and spinwich (eggs and spinach on a roll added turkey) with two mate lattes. Waffles are served with syrup butter and whipped cream. It's really delicious and worth the price (less than $6). Spinwich was amazing too. Added the turkey because I wanted some meat totaling less than $10.\n\nMate latte is like a tea latte. It's a strange combination but very interesting. First sip was bitter but gets better and better. Try it!\n\nMinus one star for the service. It's basically self-service but the woman who took our order didn't have the best attitude. It seemed like most of the servers are only friendly to regulars :( \n\nGreat decor and vibe though. Warm fireplace :)\n" u'This is a hippy paradise. There are even trees growing inside. I think they are fake but who knows. I wondered in here unplanned because I\'m a big fan of "Mate" as a coffee substitute. The name sold me. I don\'t often see cafes centered around mate so I was naturally curious.\n\nThe cafe coop exudes a coop vibe a place to kick back work read re-energize. I chatted with the owners up front and thought it was hilarious how they explained Mate tea as "sort of like coffee but with a different high." Haha it made me feel like I was doing something illegal.\n\nI ended up ordering a fresh squeezed juice while my friend got a Chai tea. My juice was incredible full of fresh veggies and tasted fantastic (while being under $6) and my friend\'s Chai which I tried was also unbelievable. It has a funny name to it which I can\'t recall right now but if you ask the employees...they might tell you a fun story as to how they got the recipe for the Chai ;).\n\nI even stopped by on the way back to pick up a "Mate" cold pressed juice with kale collards and mate tea. It was $6 and was pretty intense. I can\'t say I liked the taste but drank it anyway because it seemed like something that would be good for me. I\'m not dead yet so hopefully I extended my life for a few years ;).\n\nHaven\'t tried any of the food here but had such a memorable experience and loved the inside of this place that I wouldn\'t hestiate to come back next time I\'m in Ithaca.\n' u"I had the spelt waffle with the vanilla ice cream and berry sauce. It also came with maple syrup and butter which I asked for on the side\nAnd there was plenty of whipped cream as well.\nThe waffle wasn't crisp like I wish it had been but it was fantastic nonetheless. \nWhile we waited for it to come out we also tried the maple sandwich cookie - super decadent and sweet. \nI want to come back for the waffle but also to try the sandwiches wraps and salads!\n" u'Stopped in here on a mini-vacation to Ithaca. I loved the interior the second I walked in everything was made of wood and looked hand crafted. \n\nThey had a great tea selection - I had a rosehip tea and my boyfriend went with mint and they were both delicious. \n\nThe best part of our visit was the service after we ordered the barista told us that it was on the house!\n' u"This place has really great Belgium waffles. It was really buttery and probably not good for my health but was just very delicious! \nThe Reuben I ordered isn't very Reuben-like (they don't use rye bread nor do they use corned beef and they didn't toast the bread so it was a bit soggy).\nI love their iced mate latte drink! It's like a latte but instead of using a shot of espresso they use yerba mate  tea. It has a very distinct flavor to it--almost like milk tea. It was very delicious and I definitely recommend it!\nAlso the interior design is awesome. It has a nice old wooden cabin feel to it.\n" u"Weirdest cafe I've been into and I've been into a lot of cafes. \nThe place is entirely made of wood for one. Like the seating and tables and everything is gnarled wood. It looks like the place was grown rather than built. A little dim with oddly-shaped tables and a bar-like area in the back. \n\nApparently the place is run by some religious cult; some lady was knitting a bonnet behind the counter as she took my order and they had more on a shelf that you could buy. Still they were very professional and religion did not come up at all. \n\nThe coffee was good and the food smelled great; I wish I had bought some food. \n\nOverall: go for the experience but if you're like me and aren't a big fan of religious anything you may want to find another cafe.\n" u"When I lived in Ithaca I got coffee and cookies here a few times. The cookies were awesome. I lived nearby and one of the shortcuts to the bus to Cornell had me walking down the alley that runs next to Mate Factor. One morning at like 7:00am I was walking by and a door from the alley directly to their back kitchen was open. I looked in and there was a child that couldn't have been over 10 years old whipping something in a big bucket with a huge paddle/spoon that looked like really heavy labor. Besides child labor being illegal this really disturbed me. I later found out that their cult advocates beating children. Despite the fact that I really liked their maple cookies I never shopped here again for the next three years I was in Ithaca.\n" u'Green smoothie was epic! I also had the waffle and it was so hearty and sweet and amazing. They use real ingredients and it shows. The shop is beautiful as well I was even invited to their home! Lovely!\n' u"I've been going to Mate Factor for years and I have my staples. I always get the Mate tea and their chili with jalepeno chedder bread on the side. The chili is great but the bread is absolutely spectacular!! It's thick soft spicy and soaked in butter. One of my favorite dishes anywhere and this place is super affordable. I also love the look and feel of the cafe it is very warm earthy and inviting. The wooden interior is magnificant. Our server was very friendly and we enjoyed talking with him. Go here!!\n" u'On a trip to Ithaca we stumbled into this place on the Commons because it was one of the only places open early morning. It\'s very cozy fireplace big wooden tables comfy chairs etc. We each got a waffle - amazing. Delicious waffle.\nBut that\'s all the praise that I can heap on this place. Waffles are good decor is cozy. We ordered drinks when we ordered our food. The food came out BEFORE the drinks (2 lattes). It was about 10 minutes or so for the food (to be expected) but for DRINKS? Ridiculous. The barista / counter person was chatting with other patrons sitting at the counter while we were waiting for our drinks. Only when our server asked him where our drinks were did he start to make them. We were sitting fairly close to the counter and the cafe was slow at that time so I doubt that he could have forgotten about us.\nThe worst part though was the stony way that we were treated when we were ordering and paying. The patrons in front of us in line had a nice cheery (if a bit strange) conversation with the employee (same guy who made the drinks). When we went to order it was very clipped short curt and bordering on rude especially when compared with the other interactions that this employee had with other patrons. Is it because we were a same-sex couple? An inter-racial couple? Or because it was our first time there and weren\'t sure what we wanted? Because we were obvious out of towners? Whatever the case it was very blatant and made us both feel unwelcome. \nWish that I had done a little bit of research before going into this "Twelve Tribes" run place - I would have taken my money elsewhere. \nThe waffle was good though. Why does bigotry have to be so tasty?!\n' u"I would probably like this place better if it wasn't run by a cult that preys on vulnerable people encourages physically punishing children and which distributes anti-gay literature along with their coffee and tea. Every time I walk by I get the willies. No thanks!\n" u'Absolutely the best cafe to spare time at Ithaca. The environment is cozy and kinda an European style. The owner is warm and greeting. Nothing to complain. I super love this one!\n' u"I can only speak to three things here: The Island Sunset smoothie the Waffles and the staff.\n\nBEST WAFFLES. Good smoothie. Kind staff. \n\nI don't say that lightly and I don't usually like waffles but these are amazing. Not too sweet Dense but soft but not thick and not too light either they are simply perfect. I want to go back to Ithaca just for the Waffles.\n\nThe Island Sunset smoothie was also delicious and I only got it on the recommendation of another customer who told me he got them all the time. I could see why. It was sweet but not syrupy sweet -- just the natural sweet of a lot of fruit mixed together.\n\nThe staff were really kind. They let me and my boyfriend come in to use the bathroom even though they were closing and they talked to a lot of the customers giving it a really family vibe. I'd love to be a regular here.\n" u"I haven't tried other stuff but IMO they serve the best waffle in town. Mate Latte is really good too.\n" u'Great Belgium wafflesnice portions for the money atmosphere is very relaxing and the staff very accommodating!\n' u'Some of the best food we had visiting New York.  great salad  sandwiches and smoothies. oh and I almost forgot about the soup and tea too. \nEveryone seems nice here. I highly recommend it!\n' u"Not bad...\n\nThe smoothies teas and fruit juices are yummy. I can't comment on the food because I've never eaten here.\n\nI like the seating and ambiance; it's v. hippie/green with the wall murals and furniture made to look like tree stumps.\n\nhttp://twelvetribes.com/cafe/mate-factor-ithaca\n" u"Waffles might be as easy make but very few places make it this delicious and homey! Full score for your waffles with the blueberry compote! Definitely try out their mochas they're super indulgent (maybe not together though might get too sweet) \n\nThe staff is so friendly and welcoming and funny!They decorated my dad's cappuccino with his (super long) name!\n" u"I have cult questions so I visited.  My drink took forever but I had a lovely chat with the cashier.  I mean you are visiting a cult it is weird.  Drinks were fine nothing so special.  After I paid for my drinks I did feel guilty for giving them my cash.  I won't go back but it is interesting to visit once.  The 12 tribes are living a very different life!\n"]
18.Asia Cuisine,[u'It doesn\'t look like much from outside but the food is fresh and beautiful- clearly all made in house. One of the only places to get Korean food in town. Service is good.\nA heads up for folks with food allergies the ingredients listed are just "featured" ingredients- if you have a food allergy be sure to ask about whatever dish you ordered.\n' u"We visited Asia Cuisine after taking an afternoon break from watching a swim meet at Ithaca College. After walking around the area a little we thought this was a good place to grab lunch. We ordered off the Lunch Specials which were really reasonably priced. The Bento's are definitely worth the $$$. After we left we saw a group of Asian guys come in and they all ordered the Bento lunch which should tell you enough. If we had all ordered a Bento Box I think this would have been a 4 star review.\n\nBulgogi Bento Lunch Special - This was good it came with miso soup salad mixed grain rice beef bolgogi/onions 1 shrimp tempura few assorted vegetable tempura japchae and a few sushi rolls. This was like $9:95. Everything tasted pretty good the one thing I didn't like was the salad dressing which was a carrot pineapple puree.\n\nSoon Doo Boo Jjigae - This is a traditional Korean spicy tofu stew with shrimp and clams. I got the soup mild. The soup itself was much thinner than usual with less complex flavors then I'm used to. The tofu was very soft and silky. The shrimp was the small baby shrimp and the clams were out of the shell. There weren't a lot of them but it was enough to get the taste. This dish comes with a bowl of white rice.\n\nHwe Dup Bop - This is a Korean style dish similar-ish to chirashi. It is supposed to be small pieces of sushi fish on top of vegetables with rice and spicy sauce. This was a big disappointment for us. For almost $12 you only get maybe half a cup of sushi the rest of the bowl is lettuce and pickled vegetables.\n\nSpace: The restaurant itself is on the smaller side but it is nice and cozy. They do fit quite a few tables in there and it is definitely a very casual location.\n\nService: Overall the service was very good with the waiter checking in a few times.\n\nParking: No lot but that area seemed to have a bit of metered street parking.\n" u'This place serves authentic koren dishes that i love! The service could be faster but i appreciate thaf everything comes out steaming hot and is fresh. I enjoyed their seafood pancake. They also offer comprehensive bento boxes which i love having fpr lunch. While the inside is small they are packed with customers. The bulgogi is good but a bit on the dry side.\n' u'One of the best places to get Asian food in Ithaca. I was a bit wary at first but at least in terms of the dishes I have had they pull off Korean and Japanese food fairly well. Sometimes a little hit and miss. The Bibimbap is mostly rice when they should be giving more toppings but the bentou boxes are on point. Highly recommend the spicy soups a bit cheaper and quite tasty. My friend is vegetarian and she was really happy with her meal too. Service was pretty prompt although we went on one of the less busy hours.\n' u"I am doing a project in Ithaca  I am craving Chinese food and what do I pass?  The Asia Cuisine restaurant! I wanted a healthy option so I ordered general tso's tofu. \n\nUpon picking up my meal I was met with smiling faces. The lady up front took time to make sure I carried my bag out properly so the sauce wouldn't spill. I appreciated that I dislike spills! \n\nWhen I opened my food I was surprised there was not any broccoli with my platter. All my life every time I ordered general tso's anything there has always been broccoli. I was upset... that is until I ate my dish. It was the best general tso's tofu I have ever ordered! I could look past there being no broccoli.. only this time though veggies are important!\n" u"This place has been my favorite K food restaurant in Ithaca. But I'm sad to see the quality of service from servers is getting worse. Today i experienced that one of servers did not get us side dishes after I asked to her. And i had to give up to tell her to remind it and get us extra bowls since she never came to my table although she saw i was telling her 'excuse me' several times. I can recommend the food is delicious but you can't expect responding & nice service.\n" u"One of my favorite all-time spots in Ithaca- I eat here almost every week. My favorite item on the menu is the spicy fried eggplant with veggies and rice- always fantastic and just the right amount of spicy and I crave it on the regular. I also love the seaweed salad with daikon crab and cucumber! If it's cold out ask for the corn tea. It's on the house and it's a pleasantly fragrant and warning tea made from toasted corn..it's very delicately flavored so don't get scared by the corn. The sushi is also reasonably priced and delicious!\n" u'Sushi selection is a plus.\nVery nice corner location with a great view of the street. Customer service is always warmth .  The Korean selection my favorite ...\n' u"We love Asia cuisine. Our favorite is the Tofu Bokum! So Yum! Other vegetarian dishes we've tried have been good but not as amazing as the tofu bokum. \nService has always been fast and attentive even when busy.\n" u'Decent food quick service okay prices and good portion sizes though I would probably not come back.  We stopped here on the way back from Thanksgiving downstate and had to choose where to eat in Ithaca based on parking availability. It was a good choice not an awesome choice. We ordered a variety of dishes from bibim bob to Bento boxes to sushi. The Bento boxes were huge but also expensive. The Sushi was fine nothing to write home about [I had a Rainbow roll and the Wasabi Tibiko roll which was very attractive]. The bibim bob was excellent the Yook Gae Jang was very good. We had a party of 5 and was surprised that the server automatically added on 18% gratuity. Would I come here again? No I would try something else in town.\n' u"Disappointed with my latest visit. No small assortment of kimchi's and very little beef in the Beef Bibim Bop. No tea or anything else served with the meal. Only employee I saw was on the phone constantly when he wasn't taking orders from the other two tables occupied while I was there.\n" u'AMAZING!!!!! Authentic! Tiny hole-in-the-wall but wow!!!! My daughter went back that same week. DEEEEE-LISH!!!\n' u'Not bad. The kimchi is delicious. I like the Mapo tofu. It tastes good.\n' u"This is our go-to lunch spot (hot and sour soup is an always pre-order). Historic corner business somewhat renovated into a red brick style NYC feel...complete with industrial size open-grate heaters in the floor. Great authentic Korean food that sets the standard for their Chinese and Japanese plates(mostly sushi). Corn tea has an easy flavor and digests well. Things are priced fairly reasonable. They've got it down therefore; the place fills up for lunch and consistent for dinner hours.\n" u"My favorite dish is always the Jja Jang Myun and Ghan Jja Jang. My friend and I once seriously wondered if there's any difference between Jja Jang Myun and Ghan Jja Jang because their description is almost identical except one use black bean sauce and the other use special black bean sauce. Lol. The conclusion is that they stir fried the black bean sauce to special black bean sauce and the special one does taste significantly better. So if you are deciding between Jja Jang Myun and Ghan Jja Jang pick the latter one. XD\n" u"I'm very pleased with this restaurant. The Korean food is top notch and everything is decently priced the prices are similar to college town prices but the quality of the food is way better. I got the beef bulgogi bibimbap and the spicy salmon roll for a total of about $15. The waitress was very sweet and the food was brought out promptly. I will definitely be a regular at this place!\n" u"I don't enjoy writing bad reviews but there are time that I feel it is important to highlight some problems with Asia cuisine that people should be aware of. \n\nFood: 3/5 at best\nI came here on a Thursday night with one other person for some pan asian cuisine - we ordered 2 spicy salmon hand rolls as per the suggestion of another yelper gyoza bimimbop (not sure if spelled correct) and black bean sauce noodles with pork. The sushi we got was actually really good and I would highly recommend it. Besides that everything else was sub par at best. The pork noodles were heavily drowned in sauce with almost no vegetables or meat and the bimimbop was bland and poorly constructed. Neither were really worth eating. I would love to comment on the gyoza which looked pretty good on other people's tables but as it never reached my own I cannot comment. \n\nService: 1/5\nThis place seriously needs help in the service department. Taking into consideration that I came during the dinner rush on a thursday night does not excuse for the ineptitude that I experienced. Things that one would take for granted when eating out like receiving silverware when your food is brought out to you or bringing out everything that you ordered or refilling your water were sadly overlooked at Asia Cuisine. I also noticed that other people at tables around me were having the same problems getting the waiters' attentions. They seemed to be severely understaffed. \n\nIf you plan on coming here - I highly recommend ordering sushi and not coming during peak hours else you will probably have a poor experience.\n" u"Great place to stop for a quick and affordable lunch. Came here with my brother while running some errands. He got the side salad and spicy salmon spicy tuna combo. I got the seaweed salad and California roll shrimp tempura roll combo. \n\nHave to recommended the seaweed salad. It was a very large portion size and was actually really filling. My brothers side salad wasn't very exciting but was only $3. I'd skip that and get the seaweed next time.\n" u"General Tao or Sesame chicken is what we meant to order but we ended up with Mapo Tofu and pork instead. We were peeved it was our error we wrote the number down wrong but.....surprisingly.....it was the best Mapo Tofu I've ever put in my mouth hole. When I've had it in the past the tofu was very soft and the pork was ground and it was way too soupy. This tofu was decently sized and the pork was sliced thinly. \n\nGarlic eggplant was ok I prefer a slimy sauteed eggplant like giant slugs. MMMMM garlic slug plants. This was a drier fry. \n\nVegetable pancake was delicious there were a variety of veggies in there. \n\nTofu Bibimbap was a bag call on my part for take out. Part of the love of a good dish is the sear the rice gets in the hot hot bowl. This was missing in cardboard although the (I thought more that usual) variety of items were nicely arranged. \n\nI did not care for the sushi the rolls were a little looser than I expected one oddly smushed and some bites unevenly filled also not too flavorful. Spicy tuna roll and Wasabi Tobiko roll were tried. Meager wasabi without a kick unfortunately.\n" u"Had sushi - may be a mistake since every one else had Korean stews and veggies on the tables. Dunno - also had sushi in Ithaca supermarkets - Wegman's and Green Zone - those were better. Enough said right?\n"]
90.The Antlers,[u"I've been here twice and ordered take out from here. The prime rib is always tender and cooked to a perfect medium rare! Their lobsters are meaty as well. While thisbis certainly not a high end resturaunt the food taste great the staff is friendly and i haven't had a bad meal yet!\n" u"Just adequate. The service was great the shrimp cocktail was good... everything else was just average. Not spectacular but not bad either.\n\nI would say the charm of the place is what keeps people going back. The decor and the atmosphere are quaint but the food just isn't up to scratch to make this an establishment worth visiting again.\n" u"We live in Cortland and drive over about once a year to have a great steak in a pleasant atmosphere. It's a warm and cheery place and we always enjoy it. The service can be slightly on the slow side but mostly I think that's because they are so popular that they are regularly crowded.\n" u"We came for the Thursday night lobster special which is a crazy deal at $16.95 for a lobster. The lobster was small (to be expected) but good. I ordered the vegetable of the day local sweet corn and it was a bit over cooked for my liking and could be seasoned better. I also had the garlic mashed potatoes and the flavor was good but the texture was glue-y. \n\nWe had coffee and creme br\xfbl\xe9e for dessert. The coffee was terrible - watery and weak and tasted like Folgers. Possibly the worst coffee I've had in Ithaca. The creme br\xfbl\xe9e was overwhelmingly sweet and lacked vanilla bean and the portion was too big for me.\n\nThe service was spotty. She was great at first and became more and more absent as the night went on. We had a reservation but definitely didn't need one on a Thursday night.\n\nThey also have prime rib specials Tuesday and Wednesday's I think if that's of interest.\n" u'Food took a very long time to arrive. \nSteak fries not really fries more like baked potatoes quartered and seasoned garlic bread not quite garlic bread and Antlers Classic burger was ok but not hot enough even though we were the first dinner customers.\n' u'My wife and I were in the area visiting family before the holidays. We wanted a nice dinner searched around yelp and settled on "The Antlers".\n\nUpon pulling in there was nothing but good signs plenty of cars in the lot nice decorations outside for the Holidays. Looked busy and promising. \n\nUpon entering the hostess politely asked us if we had made reservations we hadn\'t but were seated right away at a high top just outside the bar.\n\nThis is where the obvious signs of what was to come should have been appreciated but we failed to do so until after the meal.  First we were the only patrons there without a AARP card.  Second every transfer from one level to the next was a ramp/walkway.  All signs that were pointing to what was to come but we soldiered on.\n\nWe started with a bottle of wine.  I got the lobster bisque to start  small but appropriate tea cup filled with a bisque with good balance some small chunks of meat and nice cream finish on top and a very faint touch of nutmeg nice touch for the season.\n\nThe bread was a small baguette with tough skin dripping with butter and garlic. Not appetizing at all due to the toughness of the bread. \n\nFor my main I ordered the baked haddock with steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes. My wife ordered the salmon with horseradish and pickled vegetable garnish vegetable meddly of squash and the garlic mashed potatoes as well. \n\nThe dishes came to the table with no presentation taken into consideration at all.  The plate was a small 8" diameter plate and the portions in respect to the sides were skimpy at best.  Also the rims of the plate hadn\'t been wiped after plating and some sauce and crumbs were left unfinished. \n\n My fish had broken while being plated and the crumb topping with sauce had slid off to the side if it was on to begin at all I don\'t know. Served with skin on the bottom which was a saving grace in respect to moisture due to the fish itself being over cooked and dry.\n\nMy wife\'s salmon was quite delicious although similarly plated haphazardly. The pickled vegetable countered the smooth salmon nicely.  \n\nAs for the sides the mashed potatoes with garlic might as well have been called mashed garlic with potatoes. Wow what a punch to the palate!  We are both lovers of garlic but this was wayyyy to much garlic. We both swapped our mash for a baked potatoes with sour cream on the side.  \n\nMy "steamed broccoli" was microwaved and resembled sad mushy left overs. My wife\'s meddly was salty and over seasoned and complete mush. When she requested for new sides with less seasoning for both the potatoes and squash meddly we were told they were all preprepped/preprepared and nothing good be done.  Damn they cant or wont make fresh sides?  Also what with all the dried parsley over everything? \n\nWhile eating our meal a couple of the wait staff had congregated near the service station at the end of the bar to wait for their drinks from the bartender etc.  Now in fairness we were sitting right in front of the bar but we and others audibly heard over the hum of the restaurant the bartender say rather loudly "...and then I got my period again!"  A couple scouring "side eye" glances confirmed that they heard it as well.  \n\nNow I don\'t know about you but 1. The waitstaff congregating in view of the dining room to chat is just poor service. And 2. Nothing other than work or service related things should be discussed on the dining room floor in front of patrons!  We were shocked and rather put off.\n\nOverall we will most definitely not be returning to the Antlers. From over salty banquet style food with no finesse to the nice update on the bartenders menstual cycle. And worst of all we got it all for the whopping price of 87.00 dollars.  Fool me once...\n' u"Every year around Christmas I go out to Utah for an annual ski trip. Stepping into The Antlers this evening made me feel like I had started my trip a little early! The space is decorated like a ski lodge with antlers on the wall a great fireplace that you can smell from outside and these adorable light up lanterns. The ambiance is seriously spot on.\n\nThey have some great specials for dinner during the week (3 course meal for like $21 on a Sunday discounted meats on Monday and Tuesday and some other cheap specials other days of the week!) I decided to go with my gut and get a shrimp cocktail to start and then the baby back ribs. The shrimp in the cocktail were small but perfectly cooked and the cocktail sauce was delicious and had the right kick! They also start you off with some warm homemade garlic bread which is a lovely addition to the meal. The baby back ribs were DELICIOUS. Seriously. They fall right off the bone so you don't even need to look like a lunatic gnawing at the bones during a nice dinner. Just tap them with your knife and let the meat fall right off the bone so you can eat it with a fork! I got the garlic mashed potatoes with my dinner which weren't really creamy enough for my taste (100% potato snob) and the vegetable of the evening was caramelized carrots. They were too soft for me (cooked carrots always reads baby food to me) so I wish I had another option to choose from because carrots wouldn't have been my first choice. \n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this place. It's great for dates (and isn't going to break the bank while still impressing the pants off your date) and family gatherings.\n" u'They do it all right at Antlers. Much of the menu is a bit upscale but they do a great burger as well. The daily specials are great values. Call ahead for reservations or you might have a bit of a wait which us not always a bad thing as the bar is cozy and welcoming\n' u"Terrible.  I wish no stars was an option.  For starters the starter salad was not worth $4.95. I couldn't hide my surprise and my family mimicked my response for the rest of the night. We had to send back my husbands food because it was still a patient of the Cornell Vet school. The food was subpar and overpriced.  The guy did hang up our jacket when we walked in but that was not with the $100 we spent. We rushed out of there to get to Purity before they closed.\n" u"Antlers is a great spot to go for the ambiance. In the winter months the restaurant is very charming on the inside with the unique fireplace pictures pine plank floors etc. \n\nThe food is quite good - I've had their pasta dishes salmon steak and a mix of other items throughout the years. \n\nI do recommend this place but sometimes the service can be a bit slow. Stand by the fireplace in the winter and admire the great panorama shot of Denali National Park in the entrance room.\n\nThey also have great wood match sticks to grab on your way out!\n" u'Very nice all american food.  Great service. Everyone was warm and friendly. We enjoyed the chicken marsala.\n' u'Really nice place - everyone enjoyed their food and had a good time.\n\nHowever their sanitation practices may be questionable - I got violently ill a few hours after eating their Chicken Amandine. Not necessarily placing the blame on them but they should be careful about how well they are cooking their chicken and if the chefs are touching cooked food with contaminated hands.\n' u'Awful. So disappointed. The bread was over cooked. My tea was over brewed and bitter and the Tuscan fettuccine was so bitter it was practically inedible. I scrapped off about 3/4 of a cup of sun dried  tomatoes and piled on the parm. The whole meal was sad.\n' u'The antler is an excellent restaurant. The lobster was amazing and the hamburger was cooked perfectly. I recommend The Antler for anniversaries.\n' u'Lobster Bisque Santa Barbara Salad and the desserts are excellent. I have been there about 30-40 times over the decades as my family likes going there for birthdays and it conveniently located. However the mentioned food dishes are the only memorable items I can think of after all these years. I have been disappointed with Tuscan Fettuccine. It\'s description has suckered me in a few times and after I get it and it\'s bad I remember "oh yeah I hate that dish". Don\'t take any vegans there as they will be horrified by the tacky hunting lodge decor and menu. \n\n The walls are crammed with big old dusty mounted heads of bison elk deer"jack-a-lope" etc. and use poor judgement in commissioning artwork to make fun of a Cornell institution. Usually way too dark and dusty fake plants.  We have always had excellent service. The menu hasn\'t changed much if at all and no entrees that wow you. \n\nWould be great if they had some fresh and new items on menu.\n' u"I like taking my out of town friends and family. Excellent food and service. Not many vegetarian options as expected by the name!(Antlers)\nCozy like a hunting camp and seems like one. We have a newborn and found there was no place to change him.\nI have tried most menu items and always happy. My last visit I tried the Big Mike. What a burger probably the best burger I have ever had. I have actually dreamt about this burger since then. The fryless fish is always satisfying. Could use some interior updates but ultimately that's not why I go there. The food is worth it consistent and delicious Thank You Antlers\n" u'Another favorite of mine whenever I\'m in the Ithaca area. I came here in the middle of graduation weekend at Cornell and it was obviously booked solid. It did not feel that way at all as the atmosphere gave it a kind of " Home " like feeling no matter how many people there were.\n\nThe food has always been top notch and the same can be said of the service. We had a rather larger group but our server was always there when something was needed.\n\nWe left around 8:30 and people were still pouring in for dinner. This place is definitely popular and one visit will be enough to show you why.\n' u"This is one of my favorite places to eat around the Dryden/Ithaca area. Great atmosphere delicious food and awesome service. I always go on Sunday's for the three course dinner meal special. The Tuscan fettuccine and the lobster bisque are my favorite dishes. Just amazing food! I've never had a bad experience here.\n" u'Came in on a work trip for dinner. I happened to go on a filet mignon special Tuesday! What a deal. The fillet was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. I decided to splurge and get the scallops au gratin as a side which were phenomenal. Will definitely be going back on my next trip.\n' u'Greedy prime rib. The specials are always changing and the prices good.\n\nLobster night is also good nice time for a date!\n']
96.Ten Forward Cafe,[]
8.The Rook,[u'AMAZING food here; one of our favorite date night places. It\'s a small & cozy restaurant - really pretty decor but not too stuffy. I love that instead of being divided into a "front" & "back" where the kitchen is the Rook is divided left & right. The kitchen is beside you as you eat - it just feels less hierarchical and less like what happens in the kitchen is "hidden." There is also a huge window outside that looks into the kitchen. I love being able to wave thank you to the chefs as we walk back to our car.\n\nFood-wise you probably can\'t go wrong here! We always order the machiavelli fries and the bacon-wrapped dates - both are incredible. I dream about those dates. All our entrees have always been wonderful too. If you\'re into cocktails I love their house manhattan - the cherries aren\'t your average overly-sweet maraschinos and they really make the drink!\n\nJust on a food allergy note they are also very gluten-free friendly. My husband has Celiac disease and they mark what is GF on the menu and their servers are all super knowledgable and helpful too. The fries are prepared in a shared frier but are fried in duck fat which must be changed very frequently (I assume) - he\'s eaten these fries multiple times and has never gotten sick. :) Just FYI!\n' u"This was a great spot for a date.  Our server was friendly funny knowledgeable and never left us hanging. The bacon dates were are great app.  The Spaezle was good -- you will love it if you love mac and cheese (not my fave but I can appreciate those who go for that).  My husband had the flank steak.  This had to be some of the best bites of food I've had in awhile.  He would have licked his plate if he wasn't trying to be a gentleman.  I had the fried chicken which came with greens dressed in an amazing sauce.  My chicken piece seemed to have lots of skin fat and bone and not enough meat - I would assume I just got a bad luck piece. \n\nWe had the brownie with candied corn flakes for desert which could have went from a 8 to a 10 if the brownie was warm.  \n\nOverall the service and ambiance made for a perfect night with some great bites to compliment.  We will be back.\n" u'Went to Ithaca for a show and came into "The Rook". It\'s a smaller more rectangular shaped establishment has a fun and unique menu and a great drink menu (a few phishy drinks  ----) \nI had the fried chicken it is fried in duck fat...ah-fucking-mazing (pardon the language) absolutely fantastic my girlfriend had the Savory Tartagain amazing. Cheese caramelized onion and mushrooms. To end dinner we got the "Buttermilk Doughnuts"...I really don\'t think in need to explain this item.\nIf you come to Ithaca and want a off the beaten path type of place with great food and drink this is your spot.\nMelody (bartender) is awesome!!\n' u"This place was awesome and i will definitely go back! The menu is not extensive which is fine because the fewthi gs they do...they do them well! We loved the collard greens(best i've had since my mothers)! The spetzel was the creamiest i've ever had and the Charcuterieboard was quite tasty! Just having small plates filled us up. Next time i'm determined to try the duck fat fried chicken!!!\n" u'Oh man. My meal at The Rook was hands-down the BEST meal I have ever had in Ithaca. Period. No questions asked.\n\nMy fianc\xe9 and I have been planning on checking out this place for months but being underpaid professionals we don\'t have a ton of occasions for "special" (re: expensive) dinners together. This Valentine\'s Day we finally booked a reservation.\n\nThree words: Bacon. Wrapped. Dates.\nGoat cheese stuffed bacon wrapped dates. If that was all that we ordered my review would be the same. Best effing food I\'ve ever had in Ithaca. It was the most delicious decadent appetizer I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Omg. Omfg. Extraordinary.\n\nPork shoulder that I ordered was amazing tender delicious. "Surf n\' Turf" dish that my fianc\xe9 ordered was perfect. Drinks were delicious. Service was second to none. Really everything was great- but have I mentioned the bacon-wrapped dates? Gawd.\n\nI WILL eat there again. I will find cause to have a "special" dinner much more often.\n\nThe Rook is a welcome addition to Ithaca\'s West End and I am proud to have them in our community.\n\nIf you\'re wondering if this place is worth it the answer is YES. A resounding YES. Go. Order bacon wrapped dates. And I dare you to prove me wrong.\n' u"As enjoyable as just a taste. Best mushroom tart I've ever had. Black pepper gnocchi was soul satisfying. Donuts were good but should be served right out of the fryer. That would have been amazing.\n\nAwesome service to boot.\n\nI hope this place succeeds.\n" u'This will be a first for me. I prefer to wait to review a place after visiting at least twice. But with The Rook being almost as new to the area as me and with only a handful of other reviews I feel like they deserve more attention. \n\nLike I said I\'m new to the area and my wife and I had dinner at another spot down the street a couple nights ago. On the way back to our car we walked by The Rook and immediately bookmarked it as a place to try. Tonight we already had dinner but needed a place to chill for a bit before catching a show at the State Theatre. \n\nIt was a perfect experience. \n\nWe split the Fried Chicken course with smoked honey collards and ham hock. One of the best meals I\'ve had. And that\'s coming from someone born and raised in the South. Again some of the best greens I\'ve tasted and the ham is the cherry on top. Afterwards we even ordered the Duck Nuggets. Don\'t pass these up! Delicious served with a "Special Sauce" that pairs very well. I also ordered the Lion & Lamb (rye) and Paradox (tequila) house cocktails. Both were hand crafted and tasted amazingly composed. And just when we thought it was all over our server dropped the proverbial mic a la the desert menu. Had to split the maple glazed donuts and coffee. \n\nOur server along with the hostess food runner and bartender where all equal parts friendly knowledgable and fast even for a busy Saturday night. From the front window to the bar in the back through the views into the open kitchen and from inside the bathrooms this restaurant is clean and showcases some nice conceptual artwork that all promotes the comforting ambiance. We noticed a couple that seemed to be perusing the menus posted to the outside window before we got our check. As we left they were still standing outside and asked us how our meal was. Thirty seconds later they were being seated inside.\n' u'Okay food but really overpriced. Fried chicken was cooked properly but quickly gets soggy in the sauce. Gnocchi tastes good but is a ridiculously small portion for $19 even though it was advertised as a large plate. Overall really disappointing and underwhelming.\n' u'Good food bread on the cheeseburger was really soggy.  The gnocchi was overpriced and tagged frozen. \n\nDrinks were nice fries some of the best in ithaca.\n' u'I have been here a couple of times for both dinner and drinks. \n\nFor dinner the food was delicious. I have had grilled dates and savory tart as starters. The grilled dates were the perfect amount of savory and sweet. The savory tart had a phyllo dough shell which was greasier than I expected but the mushroom and onion filling was delicious. I also throughly enjoyed the trout and flank steak. The fries have the perfect amount of seasoning. \n\nTheir drinks are inventive and tasty. The menu changes frequently by my observation. Try the Birds of a Feather! It is light and citrusy!\n' u"Gotta love a new restaurant! \nWe ordered drinks and appetizers at the bar and overall were pleased. There's a solid mix of creative cocktails high and low end beer as well as liquor- They even have Negroni on tap! Certainly something for everyone. \nService was great our bartender was very friendly and attentive and the remainder of the staff was accommodating and pleasant.  \nAs for the food We ordered a handful of small plates to split- I did find the menu creative but pretty limited. Some of the dishes were markedly more successful than others our favorites being the Chex Mix and the Duck Fries. \nThe pricing is on the higher side but experience wise it is worth it! \n\nThe Rook is a welcome addition to the west side.\n" u"The cocktails we had are very delicious! We had the duck nuggets and the grilled dates for appetizers and then the duck fat fried chicken and the roast trout for entree. It's probably the best fried chicken I've ever had. The food is absolutely amazing! Would definitely recommend this place to friends and come back another time!\n" u'I loved the Negroni on tap! Great beer & cocktail selection. I came as a late night diner and thoroughly enjoyed the burger & fries. The burger was cooked perfectly to my liking and the brioche bun was delicious. Loved the cornichon on top and the red pickled onions were an awesome topping. Shared the grilled dates with the table - super yummy and fun. Causal atmosphere. GORGEOUS BAR!\n' u"So far I have been to The Rook for drinks and dinner and both have been fantastically pleasant. The staff is so nice but not overbearing. The food is delectable and skillfully selected and prepared. We had the Reuben fries to start and an assortment of excellent entrees. The desert donuts are great too! I'll be back just what Ithaca needed!!\n" u'Mixed reviews. Food tasted good. Expensive and limited menu and especially choices for me as I have a restricted diet. Friendly wait staff. My fianc\xe9 ordered Flank steak and he got served pork which was delicious but not what he ordered. They took his beer off bill for that. Confused about concept. Fine dining presentation of food and prices but silverware is in plastic basket on table with paper napkins. And my biggest pet peeve- my wine was served in a cocktail glass!!! So I am not ruling the place out but not totally sold either.\n' u'Visiting from out of town with a friend. So happy we stopped at the Rook. Super chill environment with very nice facility. Great drink selection and cool food menu (even the late night one). The owner (Autumn) was working until 1230am and was absolutely amazing. Well worth the short walk from the downtown Ithaca hotels.\n' u'Excellent food and service. Bistro vibe. Value for sure Full service bar. Skillful bartending. Terrific addition to the Ithaca restaurant scene. Call me a regular.\n']
130.Sal‚Äôs Pizzeria,[u"Still the best pizzeria in town! I've been going to this place for a $2 slice of simple cheese pizza as a treat for myself and my son every once in a while (after band concert etc. - my son prefers their pizza over Purity ice cream - and I can totally do $2!). I do not understand snooty reviews below the crust is so good and the pizza is always hot simple and delicious. If you compare their slice of simple plain pizza with other places' greasy & stale ones the difference is obvious - I don't even bother to go to other places for the fear of wasting my money.  And I wasted a lot in my share of time in this town.  And plus I would go for this small place any day over Domino's and Papa John's etc. all those ugly corporate box stores. \n\nI am prompted to write this review because their dish really saved me this evening. I was feeling under the weather with my nose running non-stop all day and I really did not feel like cooking for my teenage son and myself. We don't usually eat out or order delivery but today I cave in and called and ordered their manicotti with eggplant and the plain pizza. Pizza arrived just in 40 minutes as promised.  The manicotti was hot & delicious! It really saved me - upon eating the warm eggplant in delicious cheese tomato sauce I was feeling a whole lot better so much so that I am writing this review right now.  Thank you so much Sal's!  I've never had manicotti before but I wanted to try a vegetarian dish so I went ahead. I am glad I did!  I'll try your other vegetable dish again if I get sick again.\n\nA quick tip for those who are complaining about their salad. First of all I don't expect great salad from a pizzeria like this. I for one never ordered one from them before. But there is a simple solution: just walk over just five minutes from here to GreenStar past Greyhound station. That's where you get fresh local organic salad. Look into deli section and salad bar. They have many different kinds of salad in glass case and some packed ones in refrigerated section of deli and then some more in salad/hot bar. Of course you can raid produce section too. Now with fresh veggies from GreenStar you will have a complete meal together with some good hot food from Sal's. That's what I did today with delivery - I had celery and carrot sticks with hummus to go along with manicotti and pizza. \n\nLong live Sal's! Ithaca would be a terrible place without you!\n\nPS: Their fried dough is a great treat too - very simple and really delicious. Lots of sugar so go for it for occasions .. but there's something about that happy feeling when walking out of the door with a brown paper bag full of hot fried dough sprinkled with tons of powder sugar :)\n" u"Honestly I want to give this place more stars because their pizza just looked about as close as I was gonna get to Jersey in Ithaca and it didn't even taste half bad. The flavors were all there but I just can't explain what it was about the crust. It was chewy. Like really tough to bite into. You wound up taking half the cheese with you on the first bite just fighting to break the dough. \n\nUgh. So disappointed. Onto the next pizza joint.\n" u'Doughy doughy and doughy. Red sauce was tasteless with cheese to match. Sparingly toppings coupled with a crazy expensive price tag...\n' u'Overpriced paid $18.50 for the 12" special. The dough was flavorless and floppy. The sausage was under-seasoned bell peppers and mushrooms chunks were too big... somehow making the pizza even more bland. \n\nFries needed salt and we paid over $3 for a Bud Light. \n\nNot sure how the raving reviews below exist.\n' u"Don't order meatballs here!\nshould have just ordered pizza.\nmeatballs were bland- had no flavor whatsoever.\npasta and sauce were fine though.\n" u'My favorite pizza in Ithaca! Delicious cheesy and freshly made- you can even watch them make your pizza while you wait. Took off one star because their salads are not so good... Unless you are a fan of Iceberg lettuce.\n' u"I just had the worst pizza ever a totally tasteless spinach and mushroom! We decided to give Sal's a try and will never go back. Total waste of anticipation and money!\n" u"Had one slice so this review may not be accurate. The dough is amazing. Reminds me of Pontillo's Pizza from the Basin with better dough. The cheese and sauce isn't anything special but it ain't bad. Ithaca's pizza game is weak but this place isn't bad. Family run great people.\n" u"Delicious pizza and well priced too! I'd be willing to drive back from Buffalo just for the pizza!\n" u"Best pizza in Ithaca! We often get this for lunch and it's always consistent. My only complaint is the limited delivery they often times won't deliver unless it's past 4pm maybe that's just because where we are located in Ithaca. We would definitely order more of their delivery options were better. Otherwise I highly recommend.\n" u"Best pizza in ithaca!! 2.50 draft shock tops! What more can you ask? Ordered Sal's special.\n" u"Ok. High points for nostalgia for a girl who went to college in Boston and survived on pizza. Oily light tomato sauce cheese and chunked veg like the best Boston Pizzeria counter places. Dining room is cross between Chinese diner country western bar and an 80's throw back D'Angelos. The draw for two tired parents was the promise of beer. Micro brews not available but a cold Shocktop in a frosty glass will do.\n" u"i've been here twice and my 2nd visit was definitely better than the first. on my first visit i ordered some buffalo wings and a large pizza that was half plain and half sausage and onion and a sub for my lunch the next day. the wings had a good flavor but they were soggy and not crisp. the pizza had a good flavor but too much cheese it was really really greasy. the crust had a good flavor and an ok texture but i don't feel like it was stretched out evenly. the body of the pizza was too thin and then the crust was huge at the edges. the sauce was good but it was overpowered by the cheese and dough. the sausage was ok but nothing special in my book. the ham sub i got had a good flavor but there was very little meat on it so i won't be ordering a sub from them again. \n\nmy 2nd visit was better overall. this time i got an order of honey bbq wings and a large pizza that was half plain and half buffalo chicken. the wings had a better texture this time and the sauce was good but very familiar it's the same sauce that pudgies and the haunt use for their honey bbq wings. as for the pizza the dough was more evenly stretched this time and it made for a better eating experience. there wasn't as much cheese on it this time which i was definitely thankful for but the cheese still overpowered the sauce especially the buffalo sauce on the chicken half. the chicken they used was a sliced up boneless skinless chicken breast which is a nice change of pace from other places using deep fried breaded chicken fingers. \n\noverall i would definitely rate this as one of the better pizza places in ithaca but it does have some faults. this place is definitely better as a take out place because they don't really have a big selection of slices and also it can be a little pricey.\n" u'We walked in to find the owner throwing some dough.  This was awesome.  My daughter loved it.  We ordered a plain pizza and picked our toppings.  We also ordered a half order of the chicken wings.  \nThe pizza was crisp on the bottom and the cheese was REAL mozzarella.  Ooey gooey and super cheesy. Delish.\nNow I need to tell you I am from Buffalo.  Buffalonians are very sensitive about how our wings are made.  These guys nailed it.  Perfect.  I could go on and on but let me just say that this is how they are SUPPOSED to be prepared.\n' u"Since I ordered on the phone this is a review of their delivery not the restaurant itself.\n\nI was in the mood for pizza but had a fair amount of work to do so I decided to go for a delivery instead. There are a few places within walking distance of where I live but the reviews aren't great and I figured I could get those any time like when I'm walking home from class. So I decided to call for a delivery from this place.\n\nI went for one of their specials a large pizza and an order of chicken wings. Of course I didn't intend to eat it all in one sitting but with all the homework and football this weekend I figured I could spread it out over several meals. The pizza ended up lasting me for five meals. Call it disgusting but I'm a lazy grad student who didn't feel like going grocery shopping this weekend. You do get a little tired of pizza after the third one but at least the pizza quality didn't go down with microwaving.\n\nChicken wings were pretty tasty. I actually enjoyed them a bit more than the pizza. But I didn't get a lot of blue cheese with it and you run low by the last few wings and to be honest they weren't that big. As for the pizza the cheese and sauce were great and there was a good amount of both. However I wasn't a fan of the crust which was really tough to chew despite being delivered fresh.\n\nThey said they would deliver within half an hour but it ended up being closer to 45 minutes. Not sure if it was because the driver had difficulty finding parking near my area or if it just took them that long to get my order together.\n\nDecent pizza overall but I think next time I'll just step outside and get a pizza slice nearby instead of just ordering a crapload all at once.\n" u"The pizza is alright and the cooking staff is nice but make sure you don't get Melissa. She's rude and will ruin your entire experience here.\n" u'Fair\nSlice joint\n$2.50\nFor plain and has\nFree delivery after 4pm.\n' u"Reading the previous reviews on this site my wife and I ordered a pizza and wings special with garlic bread.  After having their pizza the only conclusion I can come to is that those who call this the best pizza in Ithaca have never had pizza anywhere other than Ithaca.\n\nLet me get the good out of the way first - the garlic bread was tasty and the wings were surprisingly close to true Buffalo wings - and the only reason this review is above 1-star.  For my taste they needed to be a touch crispier but they were certainly more than adequate.\n\nBut the place is named Sal's Pizza... And frankly the pizza was drizzling shit.  Undercooked toppings that slid off the base a huge ring of doughy crust around the outside that severely limited how much of the pizza was covered with toppings and the cheese covering the toppings in such a way that I initially thought a cheese only pizza was delivered (seriously - don't do this unless you are serving Chicago deep dish - it's terribly unappetizing).  \n\nMy wife and I have had pizza from Seattle to Miami from LA to Boston and dozens of stops in between - and this is without a doubt the worst pizza we've ever had. In fact neither of us could have a second slice.  It's a Frankenstein combination of the worst elements of Midwest pizza and New York style without giving you any of the benefits of those styles.  Feel free to get wings from here but get the pizza from somewhere else.\n" u'Really good pizza. Crust like fine bread generous tasty toppings. A bit pricey but I think worth it. We observed other meals delivered and they looked delicious too. We will keep them in mind when we drive through town again\n' u'Exactly what we wanted in a late night pizza.  Crust was perfect crisp on bottom and fluffy good all the way up.  Sauce flavorful topics as ordered.  We got the plain and built our own.  They nailed it.  Staff was friendly and helpful even with less than 30 minutes before closing.   Appreciate they were open until 10pm on Sunday when so many others locked up at 9pm.\n']
62.Kilpatrick‚Äôs Publick House,[u"They're very efficient here.  We got in sat at the bar and were engaged in a beer-recommendation conversation within twenty seconds.  The bartender was excellent and let me try two beers before we settled on the perfect choice.  They've got a variety of interesting craft beers on tap including a few from local Ithaca places.  \n\nThe interior is great for sitting and sharing a drink with a few friends.  It's spacious and well-decorated with a true Irish flare. It wasn't busy when I went in but I've heard it can sometimes become packed in here as the place is very popular.  The bartender was very friendly and let us stay a bit past the 1am closing time to finish our drinks.  He even changed a tap for us just so our beer was as good as he could possibly make it.  \n\nI'll be going back.\n" u"My family came in for a post-graduation pre-wine tasting lunch and was impressed by the quality of the ingredients and heartiness of the food. We ordered the daily special of coddle fish and chips scotch egg what we thought was going to be duck confit but turned out to be quail? and a massive pig trotter's dish. The coddle was unexpectedly thickened more of a stew similar to chicken and dumplings than a traditional coddle. Still very tasty with lots of meat bits and good veggies bit on the salty side. The fried fish was very fresh although quite thickly battered. We had fun eating the chips with the four different sauces that came with it. The scotch egg was well-made and came with lots of delicious accompaniments like soda bread pickles and Irish cheddar. The quail was cooked rare with some bacon wrapped around it - tender with good flavor but a lot of work to deal with little bones. Would have preferred the skin to have been crisped. The trotter was enormous but somewhat one-dimensional in flavor and the skin was neither crackling nor tender enough to eat. Oh and we got a disappointing Banoffee pie that was mostly whipped topping with chocolate chips. More toffee needed.\n\nOverall I thought Kilpatrick's delivered very solid value with a smile and local beer choices. And they have these semi-enclosed booths in the back that allow for more private dining.\n" u"The food at Kilpatricks had a great turnaround a few months ago - I now come religiously every couple of weeks. You may not have lived until you've had their Onion Boxty (especially in a burger). \n\nTheir selection of beer is pretty good and goes great with the Pork and Pint. Couldn't recommend this place more - it's my go-to for a reliable good meal!\n" u'They sure know how to pour a proper pint of Guinness. Good burgers. Overloaded with everything. If they make a mistake hey make up for it in a drink. Good people.\n' u"Stopped by for a beer and dinner (super cheap if you have the coupon from the Hilton Garden Inn)!\n\nI ordered a medium rare burger a side of slaw and a bandwagon ale on the side. The burger had a great bun but the meat was a bit more on the medium side. For fillings I chose the onion boxty provolone cheese and sauteed mushrooms. The onion boxty was really yummy! Basically a beer-battered onion ring it was crispy and added a nice crunch to my burger. \n\nFor just $12 total the burger and beer together really hit the spot and I'd definitely sign up for another if I came back!\n" u'I was here on a beautiful summer Friday. My friends and I were looking for a nice treat before the weekend of moving. It was a toasty afternoon so we opted to sit inside in the air conditioned space. The ambiance is quite nice - it is a restaurant connected to the Hilton Garden so it is one of the larger restaurants in the Ithaca area. You have choices of regular tables high tables (I think) and large booths. We opted for a booth for a more casual sitting. Within the booths there were little TVs - we never found out what their main purpose was; it looked like they were connected to cable so it might be fun if there was a good game on but it\'s also possible it is used for Trivia nights. At each booth there were also trivia cards for guests to kill some time.\n\nWe sat down and ordered some drinks. My friend ordered a light flight my other friend a summer brew and me a Moscow mule. Drinks came pretty quickly - we ordered our meals at that time. The menu had some traditional Irish items and then American items with "an Irish twist". My one friend got the burger and two of us got the fish fry. Here\'s when the wait for food took some time which was surprising to me since the restaurant did not seem packed when we arrived. We started to get a bit hangry but the trivia kept us occupied.\n\nMy fish fry was practically a whole fish. Kilpatrick\'s served their fish fry with a side of "mushy" peas chip shop curry and Bois Bourdran sauce and fries of course. The mushy peas came cold (not sure if that is standard) but I was not a big fan of it. I enjoy curry so the curry sauce was a nice treat. The Bois Bourdran sauce was also quite delicious and went well with my fish. The fish was a bit greasy for my taste but the fries were nice. I was so full from my meal. My other friend who had the fish fry also enjoyed it and my friend\'s burger looked very nice. \n\nOverall it was a decent experience decent choices for decent prices. The wait for the food was a bit annoying for us but needless to say we had a good time. I have been here for a beer when the place was packed before so I would avoid it late on the weekends. Otherwise nice spot.\n' u"Ehh. Came here for graduation dinner because I made reservations too late and everything else was booked except this place (bad sign).\n\nOur server was nice enough but he informed us that we were the last table he's serving ever which was a bit odd.\n\nAnyway I ordered a burger medium rare and it was medium well at best. Was too hungry to send it back but they really should know how to properly grill a burger at a pub.\n\nMy guests complained that the salmon wasn't cooked well and there was too much black pepper on everything possibly to try to disguise the mediocre taste of the food.\n\nI quite enjoyed the apple crisp dessert but the chocolate torte apparently wasn't warmed up enough.\n\nI guess you can come here if you don't have a choice. But pick another place otherwise. Ithaca has a lot of great options that aren't Kilpatrick's.\n" u'Stopped in for an event which did not give us a great amount of time rate this place. But with the short time we spent here we had a great time. Plenty of great beers on tap with great service with a smile.\n\nWe also sampled some bar pick foods pizza quesadilla chips and fries all hit the spot. Next stop in town we will sit down and sample the full menu.\n' u'Great atmosphere and food. Fantastic selection of drinks/beer. Reasonably priced. \nThey went all in on Wizarding Weekend. It was a blast. Will eat there again...and again.\n' u'went in for an afternoon beer and free wifi while we were in the area. Great selection of Ithaca beers on tap and not too expensive.\n' u"I came by around 5:45pm on a Sunday night. Service was okay the waiters were friendly but not that informed about the menu (the menu invites you to ask about 2 sauces for the wings; I did and the server didn't know about either of them). We ordered a burger and the special of the night a combo platter of sorts. The sides for both of them did not come with the plates until we asked for them and it took us about 1 hour between sitting down to receiving our entrees.\n\nThe food beverages and value was pretty good. The burger is really quite good build your own with many available toppings and a good selection of sides. We ordered the Ithaca Apricot Wheat and a dark and stormy - the beer was pretty interesting and the dark and stormy was tasty albeit light on the ginger beer.\n\nOverall:\nService: 6/10\nFood: 9/10\nDrinks: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nValue: 7/10\n" u'Wanted to like this place but it was really disappointing.  Odd menu for an Irish pub as the vast majority of the menu isnt the least bit Irish.  Only a few Irish dishes not counting several Irish named dishes that arent the least bit Irish (e.g. quesadilla with an Irish name)\n\nThe atmosphere is decent and the service is friendly but the food is bad really bad.\n\nWe started with a brie app that sounded great.  It was clearly microwaved as the inside was scorching hot and the outside was luke warm.  The flavor was really odd as well.  Something off.  Not spoiled but odd chemically.  Our guests arrived and I didnt mention my thoughts and they had the same reaction when they tried it.\n\nMy entree was Bangers and Mash.  The bangers were ok.  Bit greasy (but they are bangers after all) and some flavor.  The mash was cold (quite cold) and bland.  The was cabbage included and oddly enough it tasted like fish.  My guess is it was stored or cooked heated on same surface as fish (it was a Friday).  I also got a side of their special mac and cheese.  Had a one note flavor I couldnt put my ginger on but it wasnt good.  One of the few times in my life I didnt finish a serving of Mac and Cheese and it was a small portion to begin with.  \n\nShame to waste good staff on such poor food but I cant see going back.  The drink list is pretty good thought especially if you like spirits.\n' u'Service was crazy good! Beers were decently priced and offered good selection. The location was good being right across public parking. The food was average and lacked flavor -\n' u'Hi.\n\nWe went on a Saturday night at 7 it was not busy.  We were sat at a table then basically ignored for 15 minutes.  We got our own menus but no one came to get our drink order or to ask us if we wanted any thing.\n\nThe bar staff sat and watched us but at no point directed any one over to our table.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes with no one taking any order from us we left.\n\nSadly this is not our first time here all but once we have had bad service.\n' u'I was really looking forward to eating at Kilpatrick\'s at the end of a long day of business travel.  I had a drink there last year and chose to stay in the hotel to eat there.  What a disappointment. I ordered the Shepherds Pie.  Described as "Created with lamb and lean beef served simply with whipped garlic potato topping" it sounded like Irish comfort food. What I received was a cast iron skillet with some crumble fried hamburger mixed with a few frozen vegetables and a heaping serving of boxed mashed potatoes topped with bread crumbs.  Talk about false advertising.  There is a new Marriott open down the block.  Next year I will try it.  There are better food choices nearby.  I realized after eating there why it was so empty at 6:30 on a Wednesday evening.  No one that eats there returns.  Neat ambiance very disappointing food.\n' u"The staff/service are excellent but the food leaves a bit to be desired.  I got the Rachael sandwich and it was really lacking in flavor and the bread was partway to stale.  The fries are eww. The cheese dip with the pretzel appetizer has no flavor although the pretzels themselves and the mustard dip were pretty tasty.  They don't actually have their own bathroom but they are in the same building as a hotel and so you have to get a pass key from the wait staff and exit the pub into the hotel to use the bathroom.\n" u'Got into town late and stopped in for the convenience of it.  Glad we did!  The Irish chips were not what we were expected but enjoyed them and they hit the spot.  The Fried Green Tomato Sandwich was a great combination of flavors.  The Roast Beef Sandwich was also a big hit.  Loved the local beer selection and the variety offered.\n' u'Our first time in Ithaca and the Fingers Lake region.  With a number of food options downtown my group was looking for a relaxed pub-like atmosphere and found it at Kilpatrick\'s.  Very nice atmosphere multiple seating options (e.g. booths vs. open tables) but more importantly great friendly service (Victoria our server was tremendous and Tom the owner spent some quality time with us explaining his "farm to glass" approach to his local beers) and very good food (my Bangers & Mash were excellent).  And a very good selection of beers (many locally made).  All in all a very nice night and we\'ll be back in future trips.\n' u"I'm going to start off by saying I've been here before and had a much better experience so I still do encourage you to check it out but my meal this time was just blah. The pulled pork was dry and the only flavoring was from the sauce on top the mac and cheese was fine but nothing special and of course the fried onion rings were delicious. They didn't have many of the things listed on the drink menu which was a disappointment and our waitress was very slow. However again I've been here in the past and it was much better so maybe just don't get the garbage platter.\n" u"We came here for drinks and food but they told us the kitchen closed at 11 and it was 10:50 so they wouldn't serve us. Then we watched two other people come in and get served food lol.\n"]
133.Buffalo Wild Wings,[u'Great wings\nBe sure to order them\nYou can select how spicy you like them from a great selection of sauces arranged on a scale.\nHamburger not so much\nA lot of TV screens playing sports\nWonderful for a game night I presume.\n' u"It took 50 minutes for the staff to turn the channel on a tv. The tv was showing 90's basketball between the Pacers and Knicks but ZERO tvs were showing the Sunday showcase baseball game of the week. 4 innings later and four requests later the channel was finally changed to the baseball game. Thanks but I've already finished my meal! \nHow difficult is it to have tvs set to live sports?! \nIncompetent fools work here. \nI'm not one to give poor reviews but how hard is it change the channel?!\n" u"I never once in the entire 5 years that I have been cooking and served through various restaurants have I ever gotten a hair in my food until this place. Good enough the manager took it of my bill yet this make me think how sanitary is this place. The table was partially dirty the hostess had no concept of where to seat people. Would I suggest this place not really unless it was a last option available. Let alone the waitress not knowing what was going on with everything. The entire crew here is scattered and have no idea how to be the crowd pleaser restaurant that they were made and meant to be. I'd look into new manage at this point before they take a down fall for the worst.\n" u"If you think the service is shitty just wait till you get the food. Wings reminded me of frozen ones you get in a bag and bake at home. The popcorn shrimp was out of a bag\n too. At least the celery wasn't frozen it was too limp for that. Perhaps the worst bleu cheese dressing ever too. We did love the fries however and the Cobb salad was pretty good. \nService means serving. Give me more than a single napkin. Don't disappear and make me ask another server for refills.\n" u"I came here on a Saturday night looking for a place to watch a boxing ppv. I was surprised when I came here and the place was empty. I was able to get any seat my heart desired.\n\nI ordered some wings and drinks. They were awesome. I've tried many different sauces at Buffalo WIld Wings and always come back to the Honey BBQ flavor.\n\nThe waitress thought that I ordered the Cinnamon Squares by mistake and I decided to try them. They were awesome! Not something I thought I would enjoy but I'm glad the waitress brought them over.\n\nBy the time the boxing match started this place was packed. So make sure  you come here early for the games.\n" u"We go to BW's all the time at our home town.  I love the on-line trivia.  So when we were on the road in Ithaca we wanted to watch our home town Tigers play the rival Indians and what better place to play trivia and get an out of town game than BWW.\n\nThe place is big plenty of TV's and the staff worked hard to find our out of town game and to put us in a place where we could both see our game and play trivia.\n\nI'm not a giant fan of their wings but had a really good flatbread and my friend had their new salad with shrimp.  Prices are good and the beer is cold.\n\nHad a really good time.  Our boys won their ballgame and I had a friendly competition on trivia with a bunch of people sitting out on the patio.  I'd go back.\n" u'Just your typical sports bar. Nothing special. \nHad the flat bread pizza which was ok. A little too much cheese and grease.\nRather dead during the day with random fans wearing jerseys of teams only they care about.\nMeh.\n' u'Being at a Buffalo Wild Wings for a Buffalo Bills game in Bills territory was quite unique. People were very friendly and an excellent party atmosphere. The barmaid was very helpful and attentive. Enjoyed the dry thai wings as well as the wet hot wings. They have great sauces and variety. Local beers were what made the difference.\n' u"This is my go to wing place in Ithaca so far (I've yet to go to Wings Over Ithaca).\n\nI love dry rubs on wings and this place satisfies that with the chipotle barbeque and desert heat seasonings. Their wings are always juicy meaty and pretty large for wings which is great.\n\nTheir service is usually good too I've gotten great service but at the same time I remember one waiter who was pretty bad and didn't check our id's either for drinks. \n\nOverall though I go here quite often and will probably continue to do so. Their prices are affordable and their food is great.\n" u'I\'d never been to a Buffalo Wild Wings before but after seeing the near-endless number of commercials that they buy on every single channel I figured I would give it a shot.\n\nWow bad call.  The wings were pretty mediocre (Wings Over Ithaca blows them away in this department.)  And the waitress we had was incompetent.   The place was completely empty except for one other table and somehow our entire order was mangled.  Wrong flavor on wings double charged on beverages beverages that never came no celery no refills on water etc.  She basically took our order gave us a random assortment of food then never came back until it was time to pay.\n\nI\'m usually not one to complain about service to management (in fact I usually hate to do so) but this was a rare exception.  The manager dutifully corrected the bill (it took about 20 minutes while we sat there doing nothing).  Nothing was comped on the check but as a gesture of goodwill he proudly gave us a small card from his pocket.   Was it his business card with a request to came back and let them "make it right"?  No.  It was a coupon for free six wings.  With the purchase of 24.  During non-peak dining hours. On weekdays.  On weekdays that don\'t fall on their weekly recurring wing specials.  Consulting my calendar we determined that it could probably be redeemed on a Tuesday at 4pm.  Maybe.  It was moot because we weren\'t going back.\n' u"It's pretty much your typical Buffalo Wild Wings. Lots of Wing variety as well as a wide selection of beers and other drinks. The food was good as usual and our server was very friendly . My only complaint was that it took forever to get both our drinks and food. We actually got our food before our drinks. It didn't seem to crowded either so I couldn't figure out what the hold up was.\n" u"The blandest chicken I've ever had was from here.  I would be surprised if they did anything more than microwave it without any seasoning.  The service is decent and the rest of the menu is average to good.  The mixed drinks are sugary and weak with a few exceptions.  They have more sports than the rest of Ithaca so there's that.\n" u"I've not physically been here but I've had their food delivered via Ithaca To Go and it was delicious. \n\nTheir jalapeno poppers have bacon in them I was also quite pleased that they used cheddar instead of cream cheese. \n\nAnd the cherry limeade was great.\n" u"Came here for MNF and it was EMPTY...WEIRD.\nAlso the bartenders do NOT know how to pour beer....if you order a large you'll be lucky if you get 2/3 full....the rest is all foam.\nTRUST ME I ordered 2 just to make sure -_-\n" u'I like the Ithaca branch more than their stores in other cities. The Ithaca branch is cleaner and less noisy. You do not see those loud sports fanatics in the Ithaca store. The staff are more friendly and typically younger. The food quality is the same as their other stores though.\n' u'They don\'t train their receptionist hostess and servers at all. We tried to make a reservation via phone but they said they don\'t take a reservation. We went early enough to take a seat and they said all tables are "reserved" . What a great service... Even though they have a lot of college kids or even younger they should not give themselves an excuse for giving poor quality of service to customer.\n' u'We love this place! The sauce on the wings are just rich and tasty! I love the potato wedges and onion rings too!\n' u"Not sure why this place has such bad reviews from the people before me but this place is quite good in my opinion. Granted I only come here for the discounted wings tuesdays the wings are good quality and taste quite good as it is standard throughout the BWW chains across the nation. I don't see any differences with this one although one time i had issues getting the attention of waiters and sometimes food took a while to arrive hence the 4 star.\n" u'After our last (horrible) visit I submitted a complaint online and was shocked when a manager got back to me a few days later. She offered us some gift certificates and we went back a few weeks later. The staff was much friendlier and more trained on that visit and I really appreciate that the manager followed through with us and with her staff!\n' u'I like the sports bar feel but the wings were kind of soggy and the sauces were not great. good place for a drink and to watch tv.\n']
92.Oishii Bowl,[u"The best thing here is speed. Quick to get in order eat leave. Also tea is free. \n\nThe menu is mysterious. No descriptions beyond a title for each dish and a tiny photograph. Online menu is better. \n\nTried both tofu dishes. The dried tofu was much better than the fried though neither had enough protein - really skimped on the tofu. The bowls were mostly rice for $9. Veggies were fresh and a good assortment but over-cooked. Bowl was very hot - too hot to eat for a while so takeout would be best. Overall both dishes weren't memorable.\n\nSoysauce provided was the cheapest kind in little plastic packets - yuck! Tables were all pretty nasty. \n\nBottom line: if I'm starving and in college town and already have a parking spot and must eat RIGHT NOW then I'll go back. If not probably not.\n" u"I would say it's the worst Japanese restaurant i've ever been to. First ramen here was nasty even raw and sticky together and the fish cakes were pretty expensive and not worth it. Also the price was quite high compared to other Japanese restaurants and they forced you to give at least 15% tips. However they didn't provide worthy service. We had to serve ourselves and they were very rude to us when we asked about the dishes.\n" u"nasty food and rude attitude. I ordered ramen. It was raw!!! Seriously?! Raw ramen?! I am allergic to bean sprouts. When I asked if they had bean sprouts in ramen they were like 'I don't know just check by yourself.' I was so angry so I didn't wanna give them tips but they forced me to give 15% tips. I will never be there anymore.\n" u"it's cheap and tasty... what more could u want? well i suppose the indoor seating could be spacier and cleaner.... but otherwise top choice for student-budget friendly asian food in an otherwise limited options in ithaca .\n" u"We have been trying Oishi now and again ever since they opened.  They definitely keep improving.  My favorite thing about Oishi is that their broths are obviously homemade and not from some salt infested pre-package.\n\nYou can always add salt but just try taking it away.  NOT possible.  Oishi's noodle bowls and soup have a nice robust flavor without relying on salt to hide a lack of flavor or a lack of freshness.  The food always tastes fresh.\n\nThis is the ONLY restaurant in Ithaca whose dishes taste like ones you might make at home SPECIFICALLY not so salty you need to drink a quart of water afterward and still feel thirsty.\n\nNice.  Fresh.  Clean.\n\nI would 5 star them but the location is pretty squirrelly and parking is tricky.\n" u'Love Oishi bowl especially when they have Burmese special on the weekend. The price is good! They make the broths for the soup. Staff is great! They always have free water and hot tea to drink.\n' u"How did this place ever get a review over 1 star? Honestly I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Worst ramen I have ever eaten... Mine and my wife's noodles where so over cooked. Know when you overlook ramen in the microwave and they get all pastey and get that slime on them? Exactly that is what their noodles where like. I got the spicy one and let me tell you... Spicy is not the right word bland would be the correct word. Idk if they forgot to add spice or flavor but it was not even close to spicy. The ground pork in my ramen tasted like it had been boiled to cook it.. And had absolutely no flavor. My broth tasted like leftover milk from cereal and not in a good way. My wife got the ramen with the soy sauce broth and the broth was better but with the gross noodles and the egg tasted like it was pickled it wasn't much better than mine. Save yourself the money and time and grab a cup o soup from Walmart 0/10 would never go back.\n" u'Definitely go for either the tan tan men or the default katsu don. Not sure about how "authentic Japanese" the flavor may or may not be but it definitely hits the spot when you want something warm and savory.\n' u'Great ramen and rice bowls.  A place not to be missed!\n' u'Meh. Miso ramen is so so. The best thing about this place is their prices. It makes you full but not satisfied.\n' u'Avoid at all cost. They gave me food poisoning. I threw up after eating their fried chicken kaarage and Katsu don. Disappointing experience.\n' u"After many-a-trip to Boston recently and enjoying the various ramen restaurants I actually made a post on Reddit asking for recommendations on where I could find ramen around town. Someone's recommendation? Oishii (or Oishii Bowl as the sign reads). I had never heard of this place... which isn't super surprising considering it's fairly new. The decision? To try it tonight after work.\n\nI made a quick order to go as I was walking to my car after work and the girl who had picked up the phone was very polite. I arrived at Oishii about 5 minutes later noticing that it's a simple little takeout place and appears to be fairly clean and my takeout order of miso ramen was waiting on the counter.\n\nThe menu seems to be pretty complete including 13 different dishes 4 sides and 3 different tea beverages. They take credit cards which is convenient (not all ramen places in Boston/Cambridge do so I always end up having to remember to get cash before going out to dinner with friends) and the service seems pretty efficient. \n\nThe miso ramen itself was okay. More bland than what I'm used to from ramen places in Boston/Cambridge perhaps but it tasted good on this freezing cold night. Perhaps some garlic would enhance the taste? More salt seems like it would help too. That said it'd be easy enough to doctor up this ramen a bit at home. \n\nTL;DR  Decent ramen option but could be spicier/more flavorful. Will visit again to try the Chicken Mango Salad Shoyu Ramen or Oyaku Don though.\n" u'Excellent little shop. We had Ramen and Udon soups and a noodle bowl. All tasty. Quick. Cheap.\n' u"Oishii is a new Japanese restaurant in collegetown that serves quickly prepared rice bowls. There are only about 7 bowls on the menu ranging between $7 and $8. I ordered the mango chicken salad ($7) that had freshly fried katsu style chicken over a bed of iceberg lettuce and shredded mango. The chicken tasted very fresh but lacked salt. The dressing was a touch too sweet but not as bad as many Japanese restaurants in Ithaca. I also ordered a green tea latte that was pretty tasty not overly sweet. My friend's bowl which contained fried pork and onions over rice while fresh and crispy also tasted kind of bland. It was decent enough that I'll give them a second try when they become a bit more established.\n" u"The place has been open for just a week and from what I've seen it's getting a fair amount of business.\n\nTheir menu is really limited - seven items (possibly eight but one was blocked out) and half are Japanese and half are Thai. I've tried two different items here and was pretty satisfied with both. One was the mango chicken salad which was pretty enjoyable. The salad wasn't drenched with dressing although I would have preferred if the mango was sweeter. The other thing I tried was the katsu don bowl. It definitely beats out Cafe Pacific's version of it and it's much cheaper. The only downside of this one was that I thought the rice was a bit too moist.\n\nThere are already several Japanese options in Collegetown but this one wins in price and speed without compromising taste.\n" u"Actually it was not Japanese food. They served Kao Mun Kai (It's Thai language: meaning: Steam chicken with steam rice) that's really Thai or Chinese food.\n\nThe food are very pricey and too much MSG in both food and their hot tray. I don't like the chicken that they served too. It was low quality and not a well-prepared one. I stopped by for a couple times and not been there anymore because too oily soup in noodle soup and price is too expensive for the little ingredient that I recieved. I preferred anyplace else for the better and healthier quality of food and service. Or just stopped by at 7-11 for cheap boneless chicken wings or make instant noodle at home still  worth it better healthier.\n" u"The place has definitely improved since opening. I now come here maybe once every two or three weeks but I'd eat here twice a week if they increased the portions and added more ramen (at a marginal cost to them of 25cents I reckon). \n\nAt $8 you have Apollo next door that will do a long line up of noodle soups *stuffed* with noodles. That said the soups are Chinese style and the Japanese broth is different so variety keeps me coming back once in awhile.\n" u"My bf and I got the tantan spicy ramen and the baked chicken noodles. Both were pretty good. Broth in the tan tan was very spicy. THE soups come out piping hot. There is a good quantity of noodles esp for 8 dollars. \n\nOnly complaint I would have is that they need more veggies and other condiments in the noodle soups. Can't just be just noodles and soup oishii!!\n\nAlso their sweet tea is good (Thai tea without the cream) but it is really sweet. I diluted with some water and waited for the ice to melt\n\nTheir current rating is 2.5 stars. I think it deserves way more. 4!!\n" u'The food here is actually horrifying. My friend was ill the next day after eating the "ramen" here which was served with an undercooked egg with runny yolk. \n\nAlso they are really stingy about the soy sauce. You have to actually go up and ask for it and the cashier will silently give you one tiny packet of soy sauce per person like she is the guardian of the soy sauce.\n' u"The food here is ok... Not great but not bad either. I got the tan tan men... Broth was ok had decent flavor but was pretty oily.. (I still had to add a ton of spices) toppings were tasty and the pork was crumbly.. But they didn't give you a lot of it. Noodles were cooked well and were a good consistency. \n\nMy wife ordered the tofu veggie bowl and it was not very good. Basically just steamed veggies on top of A LOT of rice.\n\nIf you are in the mood for ramen this is your only game in town.... And If you do come here def stick with the ramen.\n"]
148.Dino‚Äôs Mediterranean Deli,[u'FRESH & DELICIOUS!! Dino welcomes you as if you were a guest in his home. The food he serves is in the same manner. Best quality only! The spanakopita was flaky and light. It melted in my mouth. The lemon chicken was perfectly marinated and baked. It was tasty and moist. I even had to eat the skin! Nothing could go to waste! The greek salad was fresh mixed greens feta red onions and an incredible dressing. The baklava was the best ever!\n']
16.The Heights Restaurant and H Bar,[u'We had dinner here for New Year\'s Eve and the food was excellent! We had a prix-fixe menu and everything we got was great. It was not only well-cooked it was also presented well and the portions were much larger than I would have have anticipated given that it\'s a "fancy" restaurant. \n\nI would definitely go back for a regular meal.\n' u"Exceeded my expectations by far! This is truly a great restaurant in Ithaca. It's perfect for special occasions and celebrations. \n\nWe had the scallop appetizer and calamari. Downside about the scallop appetizer is that there is only one scallop but it is amazing! \n\nMy boyfriend and his dad got the swordfish. My boyfriend went with menu swordfish; while his dad went with the special and he was also very satisfied with. \n\nI went with the T-Bone steak which was great! To finish off the meal we indulged by having the creme br\xfbl\xe9e which completed the meal nicely. \n\nThe special cocktails there were also nice. I had the spiced White Russian which was out of this world. I highly recommend the heights whole heartedly!\n" u"We tried this place after getting a giftcard. The food is good most of the time. On a rare occassion i've seen undercooked items returned. However i have not had a bad meal there ever. They are on the pricey side but the food is very good.\n" u"This is in my opinion the nicest restaurant in the Ithaca area. We have tried John Thomas Cafe Cent-Dix etc. and by far this is the closest to a very upscale dining experience we have had in the area. It is pricy but on par with the neighborhood and not so pricey you think you're in NYC (looking at you Gola Osteria).\n\nThe menu has a variety of upscale entrees to choose from though many of them seem to have just one or two ingredients that are a little off and the meal would be better without them such as the peanuts on the short rib the citrus in the creme brulee  or the almonds/chutney on the lamb. However this complaint is certainly a matter of individual taste and I give them credit for taking the initiative to experiment with tastes and flavors. I just prefer more traditional dishes I think.\n\nI haven't tried any of their appetizers since I always opt for desserts and drinks instead with my meal but the bread and olive oil are nice pretty par for the course.\n\nThe pork shank and rack of lamb are delicious I know the scallops come highly recommended as well but am not personally a fan of seafood. Their entrees are generously sized and I've never left feeling less than stuffed. My favorite part of a meal here is the lava cake souffle which is everything a souffle should be: moist chocolately with just a hint crunch at the bottom. Really superb. \n\nThe service is excellent as one would expect and I feel they don't look down or treat younger patrons rudely as some other area places do. They are prompt without being overbearing which is my favorite type of service. \n\nThe one area I feel they could improve is decor. It's a little 90's craft lady mixed with mid range hotel esque. The building itself is nice as well is the lighting just an area to improve upon. \n\nI've also worked with James through my area job and he is a consumate professional. He is quick to respond and happy to tweak the menu and event for whatever you need. Overall this is the gem of Ithaca.\n" u"(35/100) I probably should have taken a course on fine dining before making my reservation at this restaurant. This is a very fancy restaurant. If you're going to splurge though this is absolutely the place to do it. \n\nFrom cocktails to dessert this place is dynamite. Our server was personable and ensured we had a great evening. The T-Bone special was worth every one of the $65 we paid for it. The Chocolate Martini paired with a berry dessert was my second favorite part. \n\nI don't live in Ithaca which might be a good thing or I'd be putting $150 in my belly much more frequently.\n" u'Upscale eating with high prices but fair for what you get.\n\nThe cook loves the sugar bowl but you can avoid sweet entrees if you like.\n\nMy swordfish was stacked four levels high.\n\n(Expensive restaurants justify the price by playing Jenga with your food.\n\nThis is supposed to convince you that the food is better than what you get at home.\n\nIt mostly convinces me the cook is thinking about the wrong things.)\n\nThe swordfish came with a raisin sauce similar to what you would serve on a Southern style ham.\n\nRaisin sauce goes better on ham than on swordfish but the fish was nice and the sauce was not poisonous.\n\n(ok - i actually liked the raisin sauce - but don\'t tell anyone. \n\nI\'ve got a reputation to uphold.)\n\nVeggie garnishes were fine except for a silly gigantic charred third of a whole onion that was hard to eat - and strangely enough the only thing that should have been sweet but was not.\n\n(Caramelized onion is a legitimate pleasure. This was just half charred half underdone.)\n\n\nMy appetizer more than made up for any failings in the main dish.\n\nThis was fried calamari.\n\nIt came with a fine fine tomato sauce on the bottom.\n\n(Fried seafood and honest tomato sauce is 9000% times better than tartar sauce cocktail sauce lemon or any of the standard ho-hums we put on fried seafood.\n\nIt turns your seafood into completely superior spaghetti and that is a fine transformation.\n\nSalads are massive and nice enough.\n\n(Upscale restaurants nearly always deliver some superior version of salad.)\n\n\nWhen push comes to shove this is a Yankee restaurant - \n\nand I like my Yankee restaurants with more plain down to earth presentations \n\nand food that is just wonderful from wonderful ingredients and mastery of the classic preparations.\n\n\nBut I most certainly did not object go "going italian" on the Calamari -\n\nand for sweet entrees - their sugar-on-the-protein plates are not bad.\n\n\nDon\'t eat here everyday if you want to pay for college tuition or retire -\n\nbut if you need to take your lovely for an elegant meal this can count.\n' u"The restaurant is pretty but the beauty's really at the bar. Having dined at the table service and the bar here are some insider knows:\n\n1. STRONG drinks for $13-15 but damn worth it. If you're a light weight (& frugal) you won't regret buying one and sharing. \n\n2. Being at the bar though is already a great deal at one of the nicest restaurants in Ithaca. There's a separate dinner menu for about a 1/3 of the price. If you like Just a Taste or tapas in general the bar's tastes will be a great treat. Menu changes often but anything shortrib (pork or beef) the kitchen does well and oh very generously.\n\n3. You still get the same homemade hummus & pita and olive bread they serve at the tables.\n\n4. Slight caveat: As with any bar when you're sitting right next to people you might also be in for a some interesting eavesdropped conversations. The bartenders usually keep people on task but don't say you haven't been warned.\n" u'Overpriced and soggy. That was the story of my afternoon lunch outing to The Heights. My sandwich was soggy a mess and not all that tasty. All of the other dishes ordered were very small and unimpressive as well - especially for the price.\n' u'Best restaurant in Ithaca. Great food fantastic wine selection.\n' u"Came here for graduation weekend:\n\nIt wasn't my graduation but I had heard a little about the nightmare of getting reservations basically anywhere for the entire weekend. As The Heights is indisputably one of the best restaurants in Ithaca it unsurprisingly was one of the most competitive reservations so we ended up with a 5:45 reservation despite my boyfriend calling the second it opened up to the general public. I'm not faulting The Heights for this though; I'm sure they did the best they could. \nWe went in and were seated after 10-ish minutes of waiting which (coming from someone who has worked in restaurants before) is surprisingly low for such a busy night especially when people are celebrating and therefore stay for unpredictable amounts of time. \nOur server was older maybe in his 60s and did kind of the bare minimum to ensure we had a nice time: said hello asked who was graduating offered congratulations and then read the specials- it wasn't super personable or attentive service. I understand that he must have been busy but I didn't think the service was as outstanding as the place's reputation might imply. It was just okay. \nWe started out with a round of drinks: I got something gin-based with rosemary flavors which was pretty good but not the best drink I've ever had. The rosemary was unique though which I appreciated. My boyfriend's bourbon-based drink had blueberry and soda water which was a strange choice with bourbon and kinda missed the mark. My second drink which was something fizzy with pomegranate was forgettable. \nMy boyfriend and I split the frutti di mare as an appetizer which was advertised on the menu as having scallops calamari crab and shrimp. It was basically calamari though. I think there were 2 scallops one shrimp and as far as I could tell no crab in the appetizer. It was nice and fresh but I thought it was misadvertised. I'm not a big calamari person so was going to nibble on the other seafood but was disappointed.\nThe Heights is notable for having huge portion sizes but I didn't find this to be true across the board. I thought that was the strangest thing about the meal. I ordered the pork shoulder which satisfied my relatively small appetite but I genuinely don't think most people would have been filled. There were like 4 small pieces of pork shoulder atop a small pile of pasta. It was above average but not as good as I would have expected. Meanwhile my boyfriend ordered a steak which was like an entire cow and he couldn't even finish it so he doled out pieces to members of his family who had ordered smaller entrees. Overall it ended up being enough food for everyone but I just thought it was so bizarre how some entrees were like 4x the size of others. \nOverall it was a decent meal but in my opinion you're better off getting a reservation outside of Ithaca for graduation because if this is the best Ithaca has to offer I can't imagine what the other restaurants would have been like during the weekend.\n" u"It's a good place for gastropubish food. Huge portions and moderately high prices. I personally am not a fan of the restaurant and it seems like everything I try is just ok and nothing I would order again. But my friends seem to like this spot much more than me. I think for me Its probably a combo of taste and lack of creativity that bugs me but I wont hold this against their rating. The quality is good and service for the most part is good. \n\nThis place does get packed so I'm completely comfortable admitting that I may just not be their target customer. I suggest you give them a shot and judge for yourself.\n" u"Ithaca's best restaurant! You will find yourself ordering everything off the menu... so show up with a party! The moo shu pork carnitas and the Sicilian Cauliflower cross culinary boundaries in all the best ways. Well worth the trip out of downtown for this tastebud blowing restaurant.\n" u"My wife and I ate dinner there last night and it was wonderful. \n\nShe had the sweet and sour beef short ribs and I had the braised pork shoulder. Often we find going places that one of us loves what we got and the other not so much. This was a real treat because both of our entrees  were fantastic. \n\nFor desert we tried their chocolate cake and was very good. More than enough for two people. \n\nWe'll definitely be back.\n" u"Overall we were quite happy with our experience at The Heights. We sat at a bar table with another couple so I can't speak to the dining room menu and experience but we will certainly be back.\n\nWe arrived at around 5:30 on a Thursday evening and there might have been one other occupied table in the entire restaurant. It did get busy later but it appears pretty easy to get a table at The Heights. We found the servers and staff to be very friendly and eager to please.\n\nThe drink menu is quite frankly awesome--they have a lot of interesting cocktails and the serving sizes are large. My wife ordered a mixed drink and it came out in a huge tumbler. They have a few beers on tap many bottled beers and a pretty good selection of whiskeys and other liquors. For those of you who are bourbon aficionados they have a few hard-to-get bottles albeit probably for high prices. I stuck with beer because I found the whiskey prices to be a bit steep.\n\nThe food was very good all around. We ordered a chips-and-salsa appetizer that came with what appeared to be house-made flour tortilla chips. I had the fish and chips. The fish was perfect crispy and delicious--although the fries were a bit limp and disappointing. The other dishes at the table were enjoyed by all. We also ordered a cheesecake dessert which was simply amazing.\n\nCheck it out if you're in the area and don't mind splurging--it is quite pricey here. Don't hesitate to sit in the bar and order off the bar menu which is pretty extensive.\n" u'The rainbow trout was delicious and light and airy. Knowing that the food was a la carte was a bit of a downer since for the prices it should include a salad or soup. Great location and great service.\n' u'I have had some excellent fine dining experiences in France Spain and Washington DC. but \n\nWow this is easily one of my worst dining experiences. The prices alone are absurd. Fortunately/unfortunately we were using a gift card.\n\nThe main courses lack composition and flavor complexity. The portion sizes are out of control.\n\nI got a trout special ($36) which was the entire fish. I don\'t think I need to eat the entire fish but perhaps whence cometh thine price. Likewise my husband ordered the steak ($59) which was also an obscenely large pile of meat. \n\nIn addition to the inordinate portion sizes the dishes weren\'t really "dishes" with a balance of sides textures and complementary gastronomical pairings. Rather they were large portions of protein with accents and garnishes. For example my husband\'s steak came out on a bed of plum-saucy (more on that next) version of A1 with a token amount of potato wedges draped about it. My fish was on a what was described as roasted eggplants in the menu but came as a sugary vegetable chutney.\n\nThe flavor profile was "sugar". \n\nThe steak sauce was very sweet and dominated the entire dish. I was not expecting "roast eggplant" to taste like sugar so I asked our server to ask the chef why it was so sweet. She was quite accommodating and honestly the best part of the whole experience. When she came back she told us that the chef said "it\'s not sweet; it has honey in it". Ok. In addition to this ignorant statement he sent the dish back out this time with more sweet accents: balsamic reduction more of the saccharin chutney on the side and a new sauce for my fish that was essentially spicy-sweet-chili sauce that you might dip your fried spring roll in. \n\n\nPros: The ambience is promising. The service was great. The wait staff was courteous and professional.\n\nGo to NYC. Go to Boston. Go to Philly. Go to DC. Don\'t waste your money.\n\n(Don\'t come here if you\'re diabetic or insulin resistant either!)\n' u"Our server alerted the kitchen to my dairy allergy. The mixed green salad was supposed to have fresh vegetables and cheese which my dining companions received but when I asked for no cheese all I got was a naked bowl of field greens with no veggies. My entree then came drenched in cheese and cream which I didn't realize until I'd eaten a bite. The server worked hard to correct the errors and the rest of the group seemed to like their meals but I am concerned the kitchen may not take allergies seriously.\n" u"As someone who normally doesn't splurge on dinners I was hesitant to try The Heights. I was very pleased with our experience here.\nWe ordered steaks off of the specials menu- I couldn't have asked for a better steak or dining experience for that matter.The service was fantastic and friendly the cocktails were well made and our food was cooked perfectly. \nI was very happy with our experience here and the next time we want to splurge we have our go-to place!\n" u"Great menu really delicious options. Everything on the menu is excellent. Have been there to the bar a number of times and the food is an great compliment to the wine menu. \n\nUpdate: Was there Thursday night arrived in late to Tompkins County and feared that there would be no dinner to be found. On a chance stopped by. Not only were they open but they graciously allowed us to have a leisurely meal and drinks. Of particular note the ravioli was outstanding and the chocolate lava cake was decadently good. If you're traveling back to Ithaca and think that late night pizza is the only choice think again! But call ahead to make sure they will be open!\n" u"I was traveling in the area and found this place looking for a place near my hotel with decent Yelp reviews. \n\nI ordered a cocktail and food off the bar menu although the cocktail was not listed. I ordered a half gin/half vodka dirty martini and the bartender easily made it to my exacting specifications (barely stirred not shaken).\n\nThe bartender also served my food and she was pleasant and attentive throughout. Service was prompt my water glass was always full and she was engaging without being pushy.\n\nFor my solo dinner I ordered the teriyaki short rib with sticky rice which was delicious and falling off the bone. I also received warm pita bread and olive bread with sides of olive oil/balsamic vinegar and wonderfully garlicky hummus. For dessert I could not resist the chocolate peanut butter torte with bananas foster sauce. The slim slice was just enough; it's so dense and rich more would have been way too much.\n\nNo it's not cheap but the presentation and quality are so high it didn't bother me in the least. Would definitely dine here again when I am back for business.\n"]
80.The Nines,[u'Visiting from NYC and heard about this place by recommendation. Loved it! Cozy chill spot and the pizza was excellent. I especially loved the rocket ship invention that sent the pizzas down to the bar from the upstairs kitchen lol. Shout out to our super sweet waitress Kristin working hard successfully taking great care of all of her tables with a smile on her face. She definitely made our experience that much more memorable.\n' u"We waited nearly an hour for our sausage onion and garlic deep dish pizza. We finished the fries and corn nuggets before it came out. \nThe corn nuggets are really good and the fries aren't the best I've had but pretty good.\nThe pizza crust was great but the pizza itself was super greasy. It was deep but mostly because it was a thick layer of oily cheese. You could see pools of the grease maybe worsened by the fact we ordered sausage. The garlic was kind of in big pieces and tasted half-raw but I sort of liked it in a weird way.\nMy breath also smelled like pizza for the rest of the night even after like 5 or 6 hours AND after brushing my teeth. It didn't just smell like garlic... it smelled like the entire pizza - my friend told me so.\n" u"Good stuff. Hot fresh ingredients make for a pizza of the like... pizza pizza\n\nokay is it the best pizza I've had? no way Giuseppe! but it's a college joint and it's always packed they have some good slices and they've been open for a long long time.  \n\ntake out get delivery they even do a little mock deep dish. with 4 large slices.\nthey should probably drop a dollar off each menu item but otherwise let them pay rent on this once imagined firehouse twice made pizza joint.\n\ncheck it out don't check it out no difference.  at least it ain't bland people always under-salt to please the masses not true here this spot is pretty decent in the scheme of things.\n" u'I would come in more often we could come in to eat there but for some unknown reason the tomato sauce is contaminated with dairy.  Rather than just put the cheese on TOP of the pizza they choose to eliminate "cheese-less pizza" as an option for people who want to avoid dairy or have an allergy.\nThe men\'s room could use a clean up and some paint. I hope they have soap next time. And paper towels.  Condition of any restaurant\'s restrooms are a great indication of the cleanliness of their kitchen.\n' u"I love coming here for the deep dish pizza. I live close to Chicago and actually like nines deep dish better than chicago deep dish. The sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and I love the crispy crust. The only downside is if you don't eat it fast enough the crust can get a little soggy. There is also a good beer selection!\n" u'I dream in deep dish. Also corn nuggets. Also fried mushrooms. \n\nBe prepared for the service to be horrible that\'s their "thing." Don\'t waste your time coming here for Tuesday trivia it usually lasts too long and the host is bad. I recommend Moonie\'s trivia instead. \n\nBut the food is greasy heavy and totally worth it. It\'s a good place to hang out with a group of friends over pitchers and overly cheesy (in a good way!) pizza. I love this place and came a ton during my years at Cornell. I have never come across another place that serves something similar to their corn nuggets so get those if you choose to visit!\n' u'Very very good deep dish pizza. Atmosphere is typical college bar but very friendly. Did I mention that the pizza was amazing?!\n' u"my official rating is 2.5 stars \n\nWhere to start I been looking around on yelp for a pizza place in ithaca haha.. Yea okay ... Seriously  why is this so hard ?\n\n\nanyways I came across the nines on yelp and after reading the reviews I thought I'll give it a shot..\n\n\nI order a deep dish pizza 6:59pm and didn't get my order until 8ish...\n\nthe pizza is nothing special honestly ... The ratings are all lies... It's greasy and too much salt ... I guess for the typical college drunk student this will be amazing but to me it was whatever.... Really I don't see this place going anywhere beside rite in ithaca  there is just no flavor no originality .... Nothing. Im going to skip for a next time.\n" u"Collegetown divey eats & drinks are what you're after?  The Nines has been a landmark for as long as I can remember when I visited friends during our college days. A reasonable selection of beers and munchie items but the deep dish pizza is where it's at. \n\nWe ordered the nachos to start and the turkey gumbo to try. Since it was lunchtime the gumbo hadn't had a chance to cook down and concentrate the flavors so was watery. I'm sure it would have been a lot better later in the day. Maybe the chili would have been a better choice. Nachos were so-so. The House Special Deepdish was killer!   With the classic toppings of pepperoni sausage peppers & onions on an extra thick crust & hot gooey mozzarella it's just making me drool again!  So my question is how come their regular pizza is round but the deep dish is rectangular?\n" u'Ordered a broccoli calzone for delivery.  An hour later it still hadn\'t shown up when I called to ask the guy was nice about it and didn\'t just do the whole "it\'s on the way" lie but he actually checked.  When i got it the calzone was about 60% burnt but I ate it anyway.  Dough (despite the char) was tasty but the filling was lacking....literally.  Description says ricotta mozz onions peppers and choice of broccoli or ham.  No onions or peppers in my calzone :( very plain.  thought the sauce would help.  nope.  tastes like red water.  \n\nall in all...would i order again?  maybe...but not any time soon.  i\'d give it another chance solely based on the tasty dough.  but i\'d definitely order something other than a calzone....\n' u'Great place. Sometimes it is too noisy but still not a bad place to be. \nThe service is pretty slow. If you go there make sure you have enough time to spend. Order a deep dish pizza it is so filling and can be shared by 2-3 people to be full. The toppings are really fresh and in good amount. The appetizers are average not so great and the range is mediocre.\n' u"Tasty really tasty. The dough was well cooked like other reviewees said deep dish isn't quick. I did not think there was an over abundance of toppings but they were fresh. They have a good selection of beverages.\n" u"Worst nachos ever. I had them delivered and they were cold and it looked like they were leftovers from a week ago and the cheese wasn't even melted and the chips were stale. Worst nachos ever. Period.\n" u"What an interesting and fun place to have some delicious and unique pizza!  Some nights they have live entertainment and other nights you get to focus on the pizza yumminess.  Just check out my pictures of the food please...and maybe you'll get an idea of why you should try it.  Wait Staff was always friendly the few times I've been.  Speed of food depends on how crowded and what time of school year it is.  Guys!!  Remember good food does not come at microwave speeds!!\n\nI love the dumb waiter delivery tray from the upstairs kitchen!\n" u"The Nine's is one of the ol' reliable joints in Ithaca: you know exactly what you're getting but frankly it's not exactly the best pizza place you'll ever have.\n\nThe Nines is a beer and deep dish pizza place emphasis on the latter.  The deep dish pizza is uniformly tasty but really more of a fat pizza than a deep dish (i.e. pan) pizza.  The pizzas are loaded with sauce and cheese which isn't exactly my favorite style but I see the appeal.  The beer is tasty which goes a long way in making the pizza better.\n\nThe ambiance is dive-bar-y which is typical for Collegetown.  Not my bag but hey you lower your expectations sometimes especially if/when a poor grad student.\n\nUltimately it'd just a decent Collegetown place.  It won't be the culinary masterpiece of the world but it's good for a quick meal with friends.\n" u"I've eaten here many times over three years and I have always loved their deep dish pizzas. Don't come here if you're in a rush its more so a place to sit back talk to friends and enjoy the night. \n\nMy only suggestion to the management is to cut down on how much cheese y'all put on because a good bit of it gets wasted. Otherwise keep on keep onning!\n" u"I enjoy the bartenders and there pizza. I enjoy the live music they have too. Go here be merry and try their deep dish pizza. You won't regret it\n" u"The short pretty good pizza absolutely terrible service.\n\nWe came in at 8 and it was pretty busy. Hostess said 20 minutes and for us to go to the bar and she would get us when a table opened up. \n\n10 minutes pass and a table opens up and she gives it to two guys who came in after us.\n\n25 minutes pass and another table opens up also taken by a group who came in after.\n\n45 minutes pass and a third table gets taken before us. \n\nI went up to the hostess and asked and she had completely forgotten about us. I told her how long we had been waiting and she said that a table was opening up soon and it would be ours. I do feel bad for her as it looked like it may have been her first busy night as a hostess as she was very frazzled and didn't seem comfortable in the job (she never wrote our name down which should have been a warning).\n\nOur food takes about 45 minutes to come out awhile but the place was busy. It just seems that the severs are new or just all were having a bad day. Tables took awhile to clear we were never checked up upon and my water was never refilled. \n\nThe hostess went outside to clear some tables and left the door open whilst doing it. Understandable until she made two trips and didn't close it. 5 minutes later someone got up from their table to close it as it was making the whole place too cold. \n\nThey needed atleast 2 more waiters and for their existing staff to hustle. I've worked in the food industry when you're short staffed and it's a rush it sucks a lot and service takes a hit but you hustle and get through it. \n\nI really don't like poorly reviewing a restaurant that I've enjoyed prior but this wasn't a good experience. It simply isn't a good restaurant a fine bar that serves food but not set up well for their main line of business to be food.\n\nI'd go again but only on nights I know would be empty don't try to go on a potentially busy night they are just not equipped to handle any sort of rush.\n" u"I finally tried this place as my last meal in Ithaca. It came out a lot better than I expected. For those who have tried authentic Chicago deep dish it's not quite up to that standard though I think it comes pretty close.\n\nSince the pizza as with any deep dish may take a while to make you should get an appetizer to start with. We tried the wings and those were a pretty good way to start the meal.\n\nFor the pizza itself we did two items (sausage and mushroom). It came out quicker than expected too. Four slices were more than enough for two people. My friend and I split the slices evenly and each took our second slices home because the slices were so generous.\n\nThere's outdoor seating too if you prefer that though those get taken pretty quick. Service is great and they have some events going on in this place from time to time so overall you should have an enjoyable experience here.\n" u'Calzone took forever which made sense when we saw how burnt it was. After we sent it back we were given an auto-gratuity on our tab to prevent a bad tip for their mistake. The four of us guests are all servers so we were pretty offended by the many excuses Stephanie our server gave us for why she automatically judged us as bad tippers. Overall the experience we had was disappointing because we used to love this place and their pizza until Stephanie gave us really poor service poor food and made really unwise judgements on her decision to autograt the 4 patrons at the table.\n']
183.Big Al‚Äôs Hilltop Quikstop,[u"Awesome Bacon Cheeseburgers.  Totally simple no fussy garnishes just real beef real bacon and real cheese.  Grab a side of fried pickles with honey mustard and you're set for the evening!  And for you crazy college kids....they deliver.\n\nActually I've never even been to the restaurant itself (is it really a restaurant?  I've always had visions that it's just a gas station that happens to have food?)  Perfect late night delivery when you want something other than pizza.\n" u"For what you are paying the pizza is good but the attitude of the guy on the phone and behind the counter is lousy. I'll be going somewhere else to grab a quick something for dinner. I don't care if it takes longer or costs more.\n" u'As I recall very good veggie subs. And I seem to remember they use to deliver beer.\n']
94.Taste of Thai Express,[u'Wide variety of Thai dishes that suit the palate and range of dietary needs. Relaxed atmosphere that can get a bit loud if looking for quiet conversation. They do well at accommodating larger groups and catering. Wait staff is typically friendly and timely with service.\nTake away portions for entrees seem to be a good deal smaller than those for eat-in so plan accordingly. \nMy only criticism is on the cleanliness. Tables and surrounding walls all seem to be in need of a good scrubbing.\n' u"My parents absolutely love this place but unfortunately I'm not as impressed. We've been a handful of times and I've also noticed that the quality of the food and service has declined considerably - not sure if it's a new chef or something but it tastes a little too processed like it came in frozen and was just reheated in the kitchen.\n\nWhen we went this past weekend we ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp the chicken satay skewers one of the stir fry dishes (with black fungus and beef) vegan pad thai (sans the fish sauce and egg) and the massaman curry with chicken. The Tom Yum soup was not as spicy as I remembered and I found the shrimp to be pretty bland and mealy. It was a disappointment compared to how it was previous times we went. The chicken satay skewers were fine but again tasted like they may have been frozen chicken that was just reheated.\n\nAs for the main dishes I didn't like the stir fry at all. I thought it was way too oily and the beef was a little too chewy. I had gotten other stir fry dishes at Taste of Thai in the past and enjoyed them but this one I didn't enjoy. The massaman curry was decent and the Pad Thai was delicious (ironic because we made some changes to it from the way that it would have been made otherwise). We actually preferred it with whatever they subbed in for the fish sauce. \n\nThe service was fine in the beginning but then our server totally disappeared. We had some massaman curry left over but no rice so we asked for an extra side and she just totally forgot and we couldn't find her to flag her down. There was also some awkwardness with having to wait to have silverware brought out for us after our food had already arrived. Another thing is that they usually bring out Andes mints with your check which we like a lot and we had to ask for them this time.\n\nThe one saving grace of Taste of Thai is that it's really inexpensive and admittedly the food isn't bad for the price. However between the fact that it was just mediocre and the service was pretty atrocious I'm rounding down from 2.5 stars.\n" u"I thought the taste of their pineapple fried rice was incredibly good bc it was so oily and had Chinese sausage randomly in it. But then an hour later I had the biggest tummyache because of how unhealthy the food was. I also had their special wings and it wasn't that good bc it was fried and breaded and super hard with a sweet and spicy sauce that tasted like it was from a packet.\n\nOverall not a great experience so would not try again.\n" u"I have been here twice and rate food as 4 stars but their service as 3.  Their tom kha ga soup was well made but I'm less impressed with the pad see ew which I found to be quite greasy. Both experiences were for take out so this review may not be as fair in terms of customer service but I was very disappointed this last visit. I ordered and indicated I would stay and wait. I was told 10-15 minutes but in actuality I waited 30 minutes. I would not have minded the wait except that I discovered that the food that was sitting on the back counter for 10 minutes was mine. When they gave it to me I complained that it had been sitting for 10 minutes cooling. The cashier made no apologies or attempt to remedy the situation.\n" u'In a town with lots of Thai choices TOT Express fell short for me. Although for a group dinner of five people the service was exceptional (thank you!) the food was average.\n\nIt\'s not bad I just tasted my Pad See Ew to be overly salty. We ordered "fresh rolls" with shrimp to start. The waitress offered to cut the 3 fresh rolls into six pieces for us which was nice for each of us to get a bite! My veggie/tofu Pad See Ew was decent. The vegetables were fresh and crunchy but the noodles seemed overly salted and salt was the predominant flavor. Ask for a spice rack so you can mix and match some delicious goodies but when it\'s overly salted...it\'s hard to shake that without diluting the dish (which you can\'t really do!).\n\nAll in all I don\'t think this is a bad choice and keep in mind with this review I\'m only judging them for their one dish -- so some of the other things could be far better (i.e. I\'ve heard their fried rice is phenomenal!).\n' u'Very few places can capture the real taste of authentic Thai food. This restaurant successfully brings a bit of Thailand to you. \n\nIt appears this place has a loyal following. Families students and couples come to this place. I found the service fast and friendly. Many of the wait staff study at Cornell or Ithaca college. So they deserve an extra applause for their hard work at school and here. \n\nThe food tastes absolutely delicious! The flavors come together to create a symphony of culinary delight. \n\nConvenient to downtown this place offers a wonderful menu of Thai food. The prices look decent. They offer gluten free if you ask. \n\nSome of the items include: \n\nFried calamari \nPad Thai \nPad see ew\nAssorted vegetables - which you can add chicken shrimp or tofu to. \nFried banana for dessert\n\nThe decor looks simple and comfortable. When visiting Ithaca come to Taste of Thai. It opens until 10 pm. \n\nI highly recommend this place.\n' u"I'm addicted to one of their winter specials the fried mushrooms. Such golden. Much crispy. Wow.\n\nI wish I could be as enthusiastic about the rest of the menu but I was disappointed by the blandness of the shrimp drunken noodles I ordered. Maybe next time I'll specify that I want things extra-spicy. \n\nI'd have to get sick of the fried mushrooms first to do that though so that probably won't be for a long time.\n" u"Great Thai food in Ithaca. Had the panang chicken curry and mango's and sticky rice. Good flavor and reasonably priced. Worth the stop and open until 10:00 on a Sunday.\n" u"I've eaten from here in three separate occasions. Every time the food was horrible - the chicken was pure fat and the vegetables tasted like soap. Very poor quality.\n" u'Our favorite place to eat!! Hands down..\nEverything is 5 star from the staff to the service to the food. You can always count on not only a great meal but you also feel like they appreciate your patronage. We go out of our way to make excuses to visit. Stop by snd try you will agree....\n' u"My favorite lunch spot in Ithaca.  Delicious food.  Good service.  Nice place to sit.  The set lunch menu had lots of options and comes with your choice of two or three courses.  What the menu does not tell you is that you also get soup.  Who doesn't love Thai soup? Just be ready to take some of your lunch home.\n" u'Beautiful ambiance. Fairly elaborate menu. Though the portions are a bit on the smaller side and the honey flavoured dishes are too sweet and somewhat unpleasant to eat after a few mouthfuls\n' u'If you really want thai go to Taste of Thai. The only plus to this place is that it has more seating than the real Taste of Thai. The food is slightly less good takes just as long and costs the same amount. \n\nHowever they deliver which gives them a one up. So I have definitely taken advantage of that.\n' u"I've gotten take out here a bunch of times--I always pick up and wait there. The food is good and not super over priced. I always get the same thing seafood pad see ew and seafood tom yum soup. Once in awhile I'll venture out to a seafood drunken noodle or seafood pad thai. I know I'm a wild one! The portions are fair for the price.\n\nI did eat in once and the service was super meh. So I just stick to take out. I've come here repeatedly and would recommend this place to others.\n" u"Taste of Thai used to be favorite Thai food in Ithaca.  The quality of the food is still good but the flavor has severely diminished over the years.  Decent Pad Thai and Green Curry.  It's not as authentic as it used to be.  Pleasant service and still hits the spot when craving Thai.  But I am not impressed by this place anymore.\n" u'Never tried Thai food before and been here twice within the past month all the way from Corning. Guess you might say we like it!!\n' u'I have been here twice with my friend. Both times I ordered the Chicken pad see ew so I guess that tells you how I feel about the dish. Chicken pad see ew is a broad noodle dish with their Thai broccoli soy sauce and yellow bean paste. This is my go-to dish aside from pad thai when I try a new Thai restaurant. Since the noodles are broader it is easier to make the dish very greasy (more oil makes it easer to saut\xe9). However this dish was not only not greasy it was well seasoned and the Thai broccoli gave it a delicious texture. \n\nAt my second visit I also split an order of fresh spring rolls (I love these things!) with my friend. To be honest I was underwhelmed. The order was 3 shrimp rolls which were stuffed very well BUT they were a bit dry and it just did not seem fresh. The rolls were sitting on a bed of wilted lettuce which made it a bit unappealing. The dipping sauce on the side (peanut oyster and spicy) was definitely a saving grace. The spring rolls tasted okay but could have used a bit more Thai basil and some mint. Keep in mind we were eating at 9pm about an hour before they closed on a Sunday (not that this should be an excuse but just giving some context).\n\nService at Taste of Thai Express is very good. Staff are polite attentive and respond quickly without being too intrusive. Decor is simple but warm - very nice place to eat for a first date or a family dinner. Things are very affordable and service is quick. Overall a nice experience and a great place for someone who is trying Thai for the first time in Ithaca.\n' u"Summary: Taste of Thai Express is an eat-in or take out Thai restaurant.\n\nPrice: My soda soup and fried rice entree were about $15 I think.  It was a lot of food and served nicely for leftovers too!\n\nTaste: I've had Thai before but don't know enough about the cuisine as a whole to judge on the authenticity of it.  I can say though that my Tom Yum soup with Shrimp was very good as was my Spicy Fried Rice with Chicken.  The Lime Soda was good but not quite as good as some of the sparkling limeades I've had in the general region.  The spice in the fried rice was nice and not overwhelming (I got a 3 out of 5 spice level) and the addition of the baby corn and assorted vegetables were quite tasty.\n\nAtmosphere: We came here for a going away party with a party of 8 and they were very accommodating.  The waiters and waitresses were very nice and tentative.  We were actually the only ones there for a large duration of the meal so I can't judge on how it would be with a packed house.\n\nOverall: I enjoyed it here!  We chose to eat here as some of the other party members recommended it and it was a good choice.  I would come back again and try some of the other items as the menu has a lot of interesting and tasty looking options.  Maybe not a 5 as I wasn't blown away but a solid 4 and I'd recommend it.\n" u'Spring specialties: crab fried rice and mango sticky rice. Fried rice is made with real crab. And mangos are in season now. Really delicious!\n\nWe ordered spring rolls crab fried rice drunken noodles and mango sticky rice all for $40. Really affordable and great service.\n' u'We stopped in for dinner tonight and really enjoyed both the food and the service. We had fresh tools and two different entrees. The staff was very helpful in guiding us through the menu and knew the details of the recipes. \n\nOne star dropped because the staff was quite slow after we got our food. Checking on us asking about dinner and bringing the check were slow. Not necessarily bad but we did want to move on to some errands (to be fair we had not indicated that we were on a schedule) so it would have been nice if they were watching more.\n']
56.Mia Restaurant,[u"I came here for the first time on Christmads and then last night for dinner. I really love this place! The menu is super diverse and features yummy items from all of the world. However I have only experienced the small plates (tapas) and cocktails thus far. All of the food was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The lamb and beef kofta was succulent with the cucumber and sweet tomato relish. The vegan soup had the most seasoned clear noodles i've ever had. The produce has also been fresh each time i've dined here making the salads really crunchy. The tandoori quail taste like tiny drumsticks of spicy goodness. Overall everything we ate was incredible! The cocktails were great too! Don't be fooled by the sweet names of the drinks. They will certainly help you get some good rest! Last but certainly not least the wait staff really makes the experience! They are so attentive and knowledgable! While there may be tons to choose from on the menu they will help with any questions you have. My preference is Jared as I find him to be upbeat and passionate in the way he serves his customers. If you're looking for a great atmosphere with excellent service and incredible food...go to Mia's!!! I will definitely be returning!\n" u'Despite hearing good reviews from my friends and having a cool concept I thought Mia was a bit lacking. Overall - cool ideas questionable execution.\n\nATMOSPHERE & SERVICE: Looks fantastic feels great. The service was on point no complaints.\n\nLet\'s talk about food...\n1. Ahi Tuna Salad: \nFresh greens the yuzu soy dressing isn\'t bad. Decent portion - be aware that the Ahi is 3 thin slices which are well seared on the edges but nicely raw in the center. A totally decent salad but nothing special. 8/10\n\n2. Roast duck puff pastry samosa:\nComes with a tamarind-mango sauce and what I believe was a chutney with whole mustard seeds. The problem is that puff pastry is rich and butter combined with the sauces which were very sweet and the rich and heavy filling - this was just dense and unbalanced. Furthermore the duck in the filling felt like it had been braised for a lot time to the point of toughness. 7/10\n\n3. Alaskan Crabmeat & Vietnamese Sausage Wontons:\nDisappointing. The filling lacked the sweetness of crab but also didn\'t really have any significant savoriness or any flavors that reminded me of vietnamese flavors. The soup was decent. There were 5 or 6 very small wontons in this portion. I just felt like the main attraction here the filling of the dumplings did not deliver. 6/10\n\n4. Pan-seared Tandoori Quail:\nThe quail was tough. I tried cutting it with my knife and it didn\'t work. I resorted to picking it up by hand and biting it directly. Also the spice blend on the outside of the quail was passable but they had completely forgotten to salt the quail. The quail also lacked any browning or maillard flavors it just felt like the spice blend had been stuck on. The spices didn\'t taste particularly well toasted or bloomed prior to being rubbed on. The raita on the other hand was thicker than usual and saltier than usual. Solid concept perhaps but poor execution. 5/10\n\n5. Passion Fruit Frozen Souffle:\nFirst off this is a big portion. The passion fruit flavor isn\'t bad but they may have oversweetened the base as the brightness isn\'t as punchy as a great passionfruit dessert is. This is fairly hard but not that dense. Frozen souffle is a fairly apt description I suppose. I would guess that the recipe is for a semifreddo. The raspberry sauce (we had no caviar) was completely forgettable - tasted like the raspberry gel on a supermarket cake. There was also some sort of brittle on top which was tasty but just didn\'t mesh well with the rest of the dessert. Also for a frozen "souffle" I think I\'d prefer something that retains the texture of a souffle as to be honest we spent the first minute or so attempting to dig into the top like digging into a hard frozen pint of ice cream. Decent flavor overall. 8/10\n' u'Came here for dinner right when it opened just in case there were any lines and was I glad that we selected this restaurant. The food here was really good! I thoroughly enjoyed my entire meal but it took a while on deciding what to get cause everything on the menu looked good. \n\nBesides food the customer service here was great as well! If I was back in Ithaca I would definitely eat here again!\n' u"The menu looked really good but some of the food wasn't quite what I expected. It was a little pricey for the quality of the food but I did enjoy my time there!\n" u"I was really impressed with this place especially after reading the prior reviews about the service.  The food was great - I would highly suggest the Natu and the Alaskan Crab and Vietnamese Sausage Wontons.  The server though was really impressive.  Not too pushy and gave great suggestions for the menu.  I'll definitely be back!\n" u"I agree with a reviewer below that there is a bit of a snooty attitude. The waiter was very micromanagery and told us not to get the menu dirty when we wanted to hang on to it (before the food arrived. He whisked menus away safely before the food arrived).\n\nFood was mediocre:\nCrispy pork shank not that crispy.\nSalmon sushi was fresh and delicious.\nRamen noodles was decent.\nCalamari was in giant pieces and got soggy almost immediately.\nScallion pancake with potatoes was just weird texture and taste wise.\nPork belly bun was delicious it's hard to mess that up tho.\n" u"Met a friend her parents and a few others there for tapas. The FOH staff were very attentive neither my water glass nor wine glass got close to empty during the meal. Our waitress was great at making recommendations as needed.  The ambiance and decor were great.\n\nThe food was all delicious. Our friends parents did all the ordering so I didn't know what all of the dishes were supposed to be but it all tasted very good. I even ate a bit of something with coconut milk and peanut sauce (which are things that can be overwhelming/offputting to me) and it was subtle enough to be good.\n" u'The bottom line is that this restaurant is not serving quality food or authentic recipies. If you want good asian food go somewhere else. Also Asain tapas? Really? The prices do not reflect the quality of the food. \n\nOur evening began by being profiled based on the fact that we were not dressed to the nines. We were almost told there was no table for us. Very offensive. \n\nI ordered the rice noodles lamb kabob and the pork bun. The rice noodles were ramen quality. The lamb kabob was supposed to be served with mango chutney and mint cucumber yogurt sauce. It came with some odd mango sauce with chia seeds in it and a sauce that was indistinguishable  from tatziki from a cheap greek diner. The kabob was also cold. The "pork bun" was not a pork bun at all. It was a steamed dough bun in a taco shape wrapped around pork belly cooked in what appeared to be chef yoshida sauce from Cotsco. Despite the fact it was actually not a pork bun it was pretty good. \n\nI got a butter chicken masala as well. It tasted like it was made without ghee and the chicken appeared to be boiled not sauteed. Pretty tasteless and served hot enough to burn satan. There was no warning from the wait staff about the searing temprature of the food.\n\nThe service was condescending. They belived they needed to explain their menu to us based on how we were dressed. It\'s a menu. Nobody needs an explanation. \n\nThe only bright point of our meal was the chocolate marzipan cake. It was rich and tasty. One of the people who ate with me ordered the creme brulle trio. The only edible one was coffee flavored.\n' u'Love this place! Definitely recommend the tapas over the regular menu. Selection is unique and delicious and service is excellent.\n' u"Great service lovely atmosphere (the banquette seating is very nice)! It's generally not very crowded when I've been there.\n\nI really like the creme brulee desserts. The slow roasted pork belly and the scallops (Prig Pow Hoi) are two of my favorite dishes. I enjoyed the vegetarian samosas too.\n" u"Interesting place. Came here with a large group.\n\nFood - 4\nFor the most part it was good. Kale salad veggie samosas shrimp in curry pork short rib tofu salad. Beef with veggies was the only negative. The beef was like rubber and not well cooked. We tried one dessert but were too full to enjoy it. In general a good fusion menu with pretty tasty food that is not out of this world. \n\nAtmosphere - 4.5\nRestaurant and bar provide for flexibility to grab a drink eat a meal. Upstairs they have a larger dining area for private parties which seemed like a great option. I can see how it get crowded but it rarely does.\n\nService - 3.5\nAt first they were very friendly. They were were very efficient with drinks and food. The only negative was that as people were eating they asked them if they could take the plate away (multiple times). That was a bit off putting. Otherwise decent service.\n\nValue/Price - 3\nIt's probably too expensive for what it is but given our occasion it came out to about $80 per person with about 2 alcoholic drinks per person and we were very full.\n" u'Mia is cute and has good atmosphere but it doesn\'t excel in any way.\n\nMia is in the Ithaca Commons meaning that it is in a sweet spot for quick dinners between friends.  The atmosphere is nice and classy distancing itself from some of the dive-like restaurants nearby.\n\nThe food is just OK.  The Karee Gai was just OK.  The Panang Curry was also just OK.  Both seemed to be adequately seasoned and prepared but neither really impressed me beyond a "wow that\'s food" sense.  I\'m not sure what it was but I had a hard time getting excited about the food in front of me.\n\nIf you go here I\'d definitely experiment with their tapas - I\'m hoping that is where their skill lies.\n' u"Excellent pan-Asian tapas restaurant with really good food and cocktails (some interesting ones too with jalapenos or sea salt or other innovative combinations).\n\nEverything was tasty and beautifully cooked but I'd particularly recommend the pork tenderloin the melt-in-the-mouth selection of sashimi and the beef with sticky rice. The service was also very attentive and polite.\n" u'Excellent food. The flavors all meshed together very well not overly flamboyant or strong. The servings are plentiful too. The staff were very accommodating and pleasant. Our experience was nothing short of amazing.\n' u'We had our wedding dinner at Mia in the private room upstairs. Already one of my favorite Ithaca spots as my previous review shows. Lex was great working with us on a last minute menu. The staff took great care of us. Family from Iowa tried many new things and had a great time!\n' u'We had a good time the table for a party was given at the VIP area and service was excellent.\n' u"A great American style Asian restaurant!  There are at least two type of ethnic elements in one dish. I ordered the pork ribs bun tapas which is perfectly done and savory (recommended). For the main dish I ordered the chicken curry and my gf got the beef ramen. I glad she likes her ramen but I found the soup and beef in that dish was overly sweet and oily (maybe that's the idea). I'm not really a fan of a Indian style ramen. My chicken curry with white rice was average. I really want to give them a 3.5 stars.\n" u"I love the concept of this restaurant: Asian tapas! I wish there was a place like this at home in Buffalo is I would be there a few times a month. Out of the six different dishes my friend and I shared all of them were quite good. We both agreed however that a full-size entr\xe9e of either would be a little too much of the same thing but I guess that might be the case it any tapas place.\n\nThe roast duck some Osa was fantastic and the Thai basil chicken wings were also quite tasty. I really enjoyed the mushroom and rice noodle bun as well. The cocktail list was predictably rather fruity in the bar was stocked mostly with different liquors and white liquors. I would've liked to of seen more whiskey offerings but I cannot fault them for that. There was also a fairly substantial wine list.\n\nThe atmosphere inside is bright and fun. On a busy night I imagine it would be rather loud so it may not be the place you want to go for an intimate date. I would definitely return next time I'm in the mood to sample a few different things from the Asian continent.\n" u'The food is amazing. Big portion and delicious. A must go in Ithaca. Try their creme br\xfbl\xe9e and lamb related food\n' u"Upsides: Service was excellent. Seated right away server was friendly & helpful. Food arrived quickly. Tofu salad was amazingly delicious as was the local bottle of wine. \n\nDownsides: very expensive for the quantity (small lovely looking plates) and frankly the quality didn't seem to match the price. Quite fancy in presentation but well... aside from the tofu salad everything was more like 3 stars. As if the whole thing wasn't well thought-out or something... Cases in point: Vegan chocolate torte was pretty dusted in cocoa powder & soooo yummy only you had to use a knife & fork to cut into it because it was served so cold it  was nearly solid!   \n\nPartner's lobster/fish masala was flavorful but there was no way to GET to the lobster w/improper utensils and no damp cloth for fingers. Boo. \n\nBottom line: I felt like the menu was so varied there was no one specialty or focus so everything suffered a bit much for the expense ($230 for 4 people)!\n"]
164.Pudgie‚Äôs Pizza & Sub Shops,[u"Best pizza sauce ever devised! Get the sheet pizza it's the best priced pizza in Ithaca and the sauce is sweet and delicious and cant be beat. Also the wings r actually fantastic. The subs r very good but they take a while for them to make which can be kinda annoying but if u have the time get one\n" u"I grew up on Pudgies pizza and I love it! A sheet pizza is standard. Thick crust light on sauce just enough cheese. Never had anything like it anywhere else and I travel extensively. If you're a picky foodie this isn't for you. It's just good pizza for a rowdy crowd or party or large gathering. It's not gourmet brick oven pizza. You have to try it and expect something fun and different with beer and soda and wings and 5-10 people!\n" u"Love pudgies I could take in bath in the red sauce. Disturbing image yes... But you take a bite of the plane slice and tell me I'm wrong! I bet you won't. Like money. Real money. Cashola.. Bread sticks are kinda off but hey why bead sticks at a place where they also put cheese and red sauce on their bread? Go for a slice mayde a Stromboli and forgettaboutit you're a puggaholic.\n" u"Came up here with a friend who was nostalgic about Pudgies.  He had fond memories of consuming wings and pizza from Pudgies as a kid.  \n\nWe ordered the family pack which was a huge sheet pizza plus 20 wings in spicy gravy and drinks for $32.  We added 3 toppings which added another $11 or so.\n\nVerdict?  Wings were deliciously buttery but not too greasy.  We got the mediums which were almost mild to me.  The pizza was edibly good but not memorably great.  The strong point was definitely the wings.\n\nThe dining area was small at this location but had little puzzles like Cracker Barrel to keep you busy while waiting for your pizza to cook.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and no complaints here.\n\nThey also have a drive thru here which makes on-the-go pick up easy.\n\nI enjoyed the food and while I wouldn't go way out of the way to come here I certainly would return.\n" u'Ordered a pizza last night and arrived early to pick it up. I just sat down when I arrived and heard the employee named "Chris" in the back making fun of my last name. I guess he didn\'t realize I was there early. Needless to say I just grabbed my pizza and left which wasn\'t great in the least. Your standard pizza that I could compare to any other run down pizza joint. Just another cruddy pizza joint with employees who had bad business ethics I guess. Good thing there\'s about 20 more pizza places in Ithaca.\n\nLong story short not going back.\n' u"The standard for pizza in upstate New York is not particularly high.  And yet this pizza is still absolutely awful.  The pizza is utterly soggy the bread tastes awful and the cheese and sauce do not help.  I cannot recall ever eating pizza so awful...you might as well stick the pizza bagels in the oven...a far more enjoyable meal.\n\nI can't speak to the wings; never had them.\n" u'Only thing i have had here so fall is the meatball sub but judging by it i would have to believe the rest of the menu would be just as good. They bake there bread fresh daily here and the meatballs had some kick to them some places i have been to the meatball sub is  just ground beef balls with Ragu on top.I look forward to trying the pizza here.\n' u"When I was a college sophomore absolutely nothing compared to Pudgie's 32-slice sheet pizza and I-forget-how-many buffalo wings delivered to my friend's dorm as we geeked out to NHL '95's full season mode. We generally felt stuffed to terrible afterwards (at least I did) but you don't buy this stuff to feel good. You buy it 'cuz you're a college student who's too lazy to cook too poor for Papa John's too distracted to do homework and too young to care.\n"]
51.Shortstop Deli,[u"Tremendous sandwich.  So satisfying.  ALMOST all of the choices that you could imagine:  they don't have a traditional italian sub but you can mock one up with ham salami and pepperoni.\n\nA sandwich of this quality takes a little time and costs a bit more than you might normally want to pay.  But it's worth it.  Not for every day.  But for a treat.\n\nAlso somehow for the first time in my life here I have found individual-serving bags of Baked Lay's sour cream & onion flavor.  Keep it coming.\n" u"(33/100)\nThis place is basically what many of the other reviewers said. I'm not from Ithaca but I absolutely see the hometown appeal and late night popularity. I went to college too and there was definitely a place like this I loved. I imagine every college area has at least one. \n\nThe sandwiches were gigantic. The double was definitely two sandwiches. I had the Reuben. It was made pretty much like a Reuben. (I was a little nervous there would be no sauerkraut or the sauce would be wrong.) My boyfriend had the meatball and claims it was great. I added a soda to my sandwich... It was literally 9 cents! That was great to see. Most combos offer maybe a 10 cent discount and this one discounted almost 2 bucks. \n\nIt was also pretty cool that this shop is inside of a convenience store. I didn't need anything but the option to get other needed items was a convenience. Ha convenience. \n\nAnyway check them out. I imagine you'll be happier. :)\n" u'It was a cold night and I was hungry.  My friend who is a Cornell alumni can\'t stop raving about his "Hot Truck" college days waiting in the rain snow or cold for some ambiguous truck to serve some sandwiches. "OK fine" So I agreed to this Shortstop deli because they had the "same" sandwiches.\n\nSince I am not Cornell alumni nor an Ithaca native I did not have the same nostalgia my friend did.  However these guys are open all night with very delectable sandwiches amongst other offerings at their convenience store.  Even my friend commented that it wasn\'t quite what he remembered but he still immensely enjoyed his order.  \n\nThis place gets bonus points from me for the backstory aggressive hours of operation and fun factor--hence 4-stars.\n' u'Worth the wait. I love choosing my toppings toasted perfectly easy system to get a personalized sandwich. Delicious!\n' u"I really don't get the appeal its a grocery store with over priced sandwiches. Maybe because I'm a townie and go during the day? Does it magically transform at night? I will say that their breakfast sandwiches are actually inexpensive but only during certain hours (before 9 am?).\n" u'What an AMAZING find! My boyfriend and I were visiting the area and were hungry but realized quickly that a majority of Ithaca closes fairly early. We saw Shortstop on our drive to our hotel and joked "We could go there tonight if nothing else is open!" Well that was just the position we were in. They definitely fulfilled our needs and more! The "double" was actually TWO sandwiches which we somehow did not realize so we ended up with a ton of food. You fill out a sheet with everything you want so your order will be made exactly how you want it. \n\nThe Cheesesteak was AMAZING. One of the best I have had!\n' u"If you're tall then keep walking I'm enjoying watching. If you're short... stop. I wanna make out.\n\nI don't get it Ithaca. Lots of love for Shortstop Deli but I've had a hot dog here which was really bad and a sandwich which was also really bad. I do love the fact that they are open late night and I do love their decor and their uniqueness but their service is also really rude and the food just isn't good. I get it though it's for the college kids.\n\nI've heard rumours that they may be serving the stuff that the Hot Truck used to though. If that's true then they deserve kudos and may be in for a raising of a star sooner or later. Ithaca's one of the most beautiful cities around I'm surprised it doesn't have more beautiful food options.\n" u'Oh Shortstop!The love of my life. I grew up on Shortstop it is the standard of how I measure other subs/sub shops. Lots of subs lots of chips lots of snacks & beverages galore! \nThe hot truck subs are fantastic as well excellent meatballs I could go on and on. \nOh yummy breakfast sandwiches too!\n\nPlus its open 24 hours a day - 7 days a week - 365 days a year so it never disappoints. \n\nI know when I head to Ithaca ShortStop is the first place I go!\n' u"Oh the nostalgia. \n\nThis was my go to place when I got the 2am munchies in college. The Sui is absolutely the best thing on the menu. Not that I've tried too many other items but after I found this I knew I didn't need to try anything more.  It's cheesy greasy (actually... the grease will spill out and make a pool when you bite into it) loaded with meat and tomato sauce and stuffed between some perfectly toasted bread. \n\nTips:\n1. If you're a stick get a single. If you eat a good amount and you're pretty hungry get a double. If you eat a lot and you're starving get a grand slam. \n2. Get a drink with your meal. If you order a sub drinks are like 20 cents.\n3. DON'T GET VEGETABLES. The order slip says it's $.75 for unlimited veggies but I was charged $.75 for each veggie. I contested this but was told that this was how they charged. Anyways face it. You just ordered a heart attack-inducing grease bomb; vegetables won't make your situation any better.\n" u"No tomatoes in my sandwiches.\n\nAfter be around the town for 10 years this is my first time stop by with high hope this is the place I must stop by as soon as I have a chance and for the real situation I am very disappointed by had no tomatoes in my double sandwiches for my first impression with my dream place. Classic.\n\nI was only asked for simply lettuce tomatoes and onions with slices beef and blue cheese. The order take a bit long to wait ( only 3 orders before me.) I walked around the shop that was really clean. And I like the sign that said they served over million customers since they open also 1000 customers daily. That's really impressed. Then I grabbed a cup of coffee with my sandwiches. The sandwiches was come in package wrapped. Then I couldn't see if I miss any ingredient.  \n\nAfter I walked back to downtown laid back and started to open the wrapped then I found out I missed the pieces of tomatoes. That's really disappointed. I don't know their intend behind that but they should do better/ more professional than this. Without any explanation I feel like they can take advantage from any innocent customer. If I trust them and did not check in front of them right away what missing in my sandwiches. And I feel like they took advantage of my food that I paid full price right away. And the staffs should be honest to my food and to customers at all time. So just beware then :) \n\nFor this price I can buy whole loaf of bread meat other garnish veggies from TOPS and prepared by myself too :) Does not difficult.\n" u"Great late night eats. Poor Man's Pizza is hot crunch cheesy very satisfying. Reasonable prices good service. There's no reason not to come here.\n" u"I have not been here since two years. The sub I purchased was mixed meat and it was amazing O bought a 12 inch but I only could eat 1/2.  Omg! It was very good I could never find this I'm Kissimmee Florida where I am from.  The people were very nice that worked making sandwiches and cashing me out.\n" u"This place is a gem. It's 24/7 yet ALWAYS busy and there is a reason. They got a nice little store and the sandwich station has great people working there who makes good hearty sandwiches. They're not 5 star sandwiches but they ain't bad at all. You can tell from the signs shown that they care about their community and they really do. If you're in Ithaca stop here if you're drunk and hungry.\n" u'Great subs at great prices. Food is always prepared quickly\n' u"Delicious subs! I love the bread! I really like the chicken salad that's my go to sub here! Fast friendly service. Reasonably priced as well. The best part is that it is always open so it's perfect.\n" u"My office orders subs from here about once a week and they are always tasty and huge. I don't know much about the staff because I typically have my assistant pick up the food but she tells me they are always nice and pleasant as well as fast and diligent.\n" u"Twenty-five years ago my boyfriend (now husband) lived across the street from this place so it was a staple. A couple of weeks ago I was visiting with the family and needed a quick bite.  I'm glad to say Shortstop hasn't lost its touch.  My only regret is that I forgot to tell them to toast my bun.  \n\nAll in all good food good value! Still an Ithaca tradition!\n" u"Pretty good sandwiches and it's cool that they never close so there's always a serviceable food option in town at all times.\n\nYou order by filling out a little form and handing it to one of the sandwich makers instead of taking a number or explaining to them what you want. In that sense I guess it's a little more efficient. But I personally find this place to be kinda slow considering how many people they have working.\n\nSandwiches themselves are pretty expensive though compared to delis in other cities. Plus you have to pay for cheese here which I've never seen done anywhere else. My staple sandwich everywhere is a large pastrami with cheese which is like $11 here when I could get that back home for $7.\n\nThey also have some of the Hot Truck sandwiches but since I'm not a fan of Hot Truck I haven't tried them here. But if you are craving them you can always come here when the truck is closed.\n" u'Wow this sandwich is garbage. Go to a different place for late night food. How do you screw up a philly cheese steak? Why wouldn\'t you just remake the steak if you burned it? What a joke... I guess this is what you should expect from a ithacas only late night deli no other excuse besides "I guess it\'s open".. Ice cream is ok though.\n' u"My go to place after work if I'm hungry. It's a deli/convience store and best of all it's 24/7/365. The food is usually pretty good and quick though the sandwiches I think are a little expensive but they have $.09 sodas.\n"]
186.Pizza Hut,[u"This is the pizza place Ithacans go to if they've given up on life. That said it's close to where I live and they do make a tasty P'zone. Who needs a life when you have two giant cheap calzones called a P'zone?!\n" u"No one expects the best service from delivery pizza. Nevertheless delaying the delivery by more than an hour when the destination is quite literally a five-minute drive away is especially atrocious. Order from Domino's instead.\n" u"Well to start the service wasn't the greatest. The server had quite the attitude and wasn't friendly. The salad from the salad bar didn't look to fresh but the pizza and and wings were fairly good so that is a plus.\n" u'I like pizza hut but this is a really terrible dirty pizza hut with rude service especially the cashier woman. Never come again.\n' u"The customer service here is horrible. I've been going here for years and I was outraged to stand there and listen to the three girls on duty (one being a manager) complain about various topics including the phone constantly ringing. None of them were in any kind of hurry to help customers that were standing there while their food was ready and waiting in the window. Maybe some more training in CUSTOMER SERVICE is needed. Previous staff would have never behaved this way!\n" u'The food here sux stay away the place is very run down the food is just gross they need to be shut down\n' u"I was reluctant to even do lunch here but my husband really wanted pizza hut deep dish so we gave it a whirl. Minus stars for service and not because of the waitress herself but for lack of staff. 1 server 1 cook 1 delivery guy. It's like they assume their business will be dead on a Sunday at noon. 5 tables walked in shortly after we did and all heck broke loose. But poor service aside Pizza Hut deep dish is still classic and delicious!\n" u'Great service every visit. Open late on saterdays...good pizza!!! Also very good cinnamon sticks!\n']
68.Spring Buffet & Grill,[u'Hidden gem in Ithaca!\n\nWas so cheap went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the food selection.\n\nFood placement was a bit odd (raw shrimp placed right next to the desserts) but overall the restaurant was very clean and you get to eat a ton of food.\n' u'The hostess and table service staff was friendly. Other than that there is nothing good about this restaurant. \n\nTwo hours before closing everything looked picked over buffet items were lukewarm the sushi looked old and dried out the desserts were nondescript cafeteria-style. \n\nThere is no tofu available. Very little in the way of vegetarian options. There is a select-your-own hibachi which was tasty. However the chef was visibly annoyed that I interrupted his cell phone browsing to cook my meal and was irritated at my questions about the process (the signage is unclear). Wow. It really put a damper on the evening.  \n\nThe dining room was chilly and cavernous. The soy sauce tasted watered down. The tea cups had cracks. The kitchen started vacuuming an hour and a half before closing time with a dozen people still in the dining room. To top it off two out of our party of five had GI issues in the 24 hours following eating there. I will never go back.\n' u"Decent Chinese buffet in the area. It has a nice selection of your typical American-Chinese favorites and it tastes fresh and pretty good. I couldn't complain about the prices either as they were pretty fair in their own right. They also have a good hibachi section which made it more than just a buffet. It definitely has a nice following as it was pretty busy even after the usual lunch hour. \n\nWhat a nice find.\n" u"I am a Jersey native coming to school at IC. Jersey is the last of Chinese buffets so I have been spoiled growing up... unfortunately spring buffet is about 15 years behind Jersey standards but that doesn't mean it's a bad place to eat. I still come here to eat on occasion when I want to remember my childhood. Hahaha... but in terms of ranking this buffet is the best in the finger lakes area but comparatively to NJ is in the bottom percentile.\n" u"This buffet is not the best. The food honestly isn't that good. I would recommend going elsewhere.\n" u"This buffet is very spacious and the staff is friendly and efficient. Those are really the only positives.\n\nI am quite familiar with these types of buffets as they are a business model that pops up all over the country. The food tends to be the same: A general selection of Americanized Chinese food plus the frequent addition of a made-to-order hibachi and a selection of sushi.\n\nSpring Buffet is no different offering General Tso's chicken fried shrimp california rolls and all the other stuff you see at these buffets. However they don't do it very well. Everything we ate was quite bland and served at near-room temperature which is very unappetizing. The serving area is not kept hot and products are not rotated. Seasoning is non-existent and the ingredients used in the dishes seem to be very low quality.\n\nWe quickly lost our appetites after sampling a few dishes; luckily it's not expensive or we'd have been pretty cranky about paying to eat here. We won't be returning.\n" u'Husband and kids ate there tonight.  Ate their whole meal only to find a dead bug in the ice cream (well the peanuts on the ice cream).  Was told the exterminator was there today and that is probably why.  Got the meal free if that is any conciliation.\n' u'Made two trips to the Spring Buffet this summer. All in all many dishes from not just Chinese cuisine (though those are the best). I also enjoyed their soups and the customized hibachi was great too. For $11 simply cannot go wrong.\n' u"Relatively clean most of the time (we've been there about 4 times in 5 months); however BLAND BLAND BLAND.  ALL of the dishes except the hibachi which you customize taste EXACTLY like one another.\n\nI too wanted to have another buffet option in town; however I tried it several times and each time it was the same.  As if there was only 1 dish on the entire buffet because they all taste the same.\n\nAlso - no distinctive Asian flavors like ginger or garlic - or oyster sauce - or anything.  I mean each time I went I expected a different result but each time it was the same.\n\nFor my money and my time the other buffet in town may be a little older and a little worn but the food there is much more flavorful fresher and has a great variety of flavors.\n" u"I absolutely have no idea how they keep their business profitable with all these great foods. This deal is too good to be true. I'm super stuffed! So ... let me just briefly describe this buffet restaurant in five words and let my pictures speak the rest. \n\n1) $11.49\n2) Seafood\n3) Steak\n4) Sushi\n5) Dessert\n\nPS. To starving college kids I know what you are thinking but let's try to keep Spring Buffet & Grill alive for the benefits of Ithacans ;)\n" u'Good selection of food price is reasonable. Decor looks great! Surprised not busy on a sunday.\n' u'This place is a spore of C-Dif made my entire family was sick!!.. Heath department should be called on this place!! The owners should be ashamed of themselves for serving this disgusting food and make people pay almost 30 dollars.. DO NOT EAT AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!! Fortune cookies should read.. One must Imodium!!\n' u"There's selection but there was no salmon sushi rolls just mostly crab. The price is decent. Service was good. For lunch there was no salmon. They said there was salmon for dinner.\n" u'Great place they have a large selection!!! There food is fresh and good.. I am glad that e stop to eat here.. So if you are in the area and like Chinese food go!!!\n' u"I'm not usually a fan of buffets but this one was good. \nThe food was very fresh and high quality. I didn't hate eating here like all other buffets. \nThere are very many items to chose from but not a lot of good vegetarian items. \nThe lo mein was very tasty and the choy was great. \nMy only recommendations would be to a add at least one tofu dish and also labeling on the dishes that is more specific. Like what kind of egg roll is this?\n" u'Good food and priced really well. Brand new and clean place. Lots of selection - A LOT of seafood (shrimp dishes scallops crab legs etc.) and real sushi (by real I mean they include a wide variety of authentic rolls and raw fish). Has a make-your-own hibachi station. \n\n$11.49 per person for dinner on Fridays and Saturdays $10.49 Monday-Thursday $10.99 all day Sundays. \nLunch Monday-Thursday is $6.99 Fridays and Saturdays $7.29.\n' u"Yes the food is unlimited but it's very poor quality. The sushi was the main highlight however there was a very small selection and they did not replace rolls after they ran out. In addition all the Chinese food left me wondering if I would be food poisoned. The salad bar was the lowest quality part of the visit; it tasted as if the food had been constantly put out for days until someone ate it. I am not an Ithaca native and i frequent buffets of this style in my hometown and among my travels. This was not the worst buffet i've ever been to but I see no reason to ever go back.\n" u'At just over $10/person for dinner the value was good. One person in our party had a lemonade. $1.75 for the glass but included refills. The rest of us prefer water. \n\nYou should be able to find something that you find is OK to eat and depending on your taste you may luck out and find something you think is good. In our party of three we all found several things (most of which we\'ve enjoyed numerous times at other restaurants) which we didn\'t care for at all. One person in our group said of the items he did finish that "they were just ok not good" (but as he said he could see going back if he were really hungry and didn\'t want to spend much.)\n\nThere was a hibachi bar (pick out the food you wanted and they\'d put it on the cooktop at the counter) but the items on it didn\'t look that intriguing to any of us so we passed on it. The sushi bar (pre-made rolls sitting there without labels) didn\'t pique our interest either. \n\nThere was a carving station (carve your own) with ham sausage and beef. The beef was well done (as in brown all the way through) -- the one who ate it said it was chewy but the flavor was good. \n\nThere were a few soups to choose from. We didn\'t see any wonton soup. (Not a problem as we weren\'t in a soup mood. Just commenting as wonton soup is usually a staple at the buffets we\'d been to in the past.)\n\nA couple of oddities on the buffet which I haven\'t seen elsewhere:\nCrawfish and frogs legs. (Frogs legs were edible. I\'m guessing that the crawfish were in some sort of Cajun seasoning which I didn\'t care for but perhaps that\'s the type of seasoning rather than their preparation.)\n\nThe dim sum that I ate was disappointing. And as that\'s usually one area of the buffet where I usually have fun it was a bit of a letdown that the selection was minimal. Dumplings and shu Mai were heavy and dried out. The egg roll that I had was awful. Took one bite and put it down (and was tempted to spit out what was in my mouth) -- thick stale tasting crust.. I would have had to take another bite to get to any filling. \n\nI would have liked to see more vegetable dishes to choose from to help balance out the various meat and seafood items. I did have some Bok Choy which was as expected. \n\nI enjoyed the salt and pepper shrimp. Note: They were whole with the heads on which bothered the third person in our group. \n\nThe person on our group who usually enjoys various items with barbecue sauce said those items were inedible here. The pork chops didn\'t look like they had a sauce but they did and the sweet heavy taste was overpowering. (Barbecue sauce whether or not it was visible tasted like a very heavy sugar glaze with no smokiness or anything to take away from the beyond-cloyingly sweetness.)\n\nOverall if this were a restaurant where you ordered specific dishes I would have only given it one or two stars. Same if the cost were higher. But since you can push aside whatever you dislike in a search to find the ones that you think are ok or better and you can do so at such a low price I\'ve given it three stars.\n' u"Very good! BEST buffet around. Please note the best time to go is during dinner hours as there is far better selection of dishes. The sushi is amazing and all the dishes were very flavorful. One of the few chinese buffets I've been to that's spicy food is actually spicy. Also one of the downfalls of buffets is that the food can become lukewarm. In contrast at this buffet all the food was piping hot!  Would highly recommend! Especially the coconut shrimp honey chicken and dim sum.\n" u"So most Chinese Buffets feel real dirty (especially the bathrooms).  But this one was pretty clean!  I would give it 4 stars for that.\n\nBut one star for the food.  \n\nFirst time there and that was the most tasteless chinese food I have ever had in my life.\nBland and bad.\n\nShrimp - grimy\nCrab Legs - zero taste\nLo mein - slimy\ngeneral tao - flavorless\n\nand it wasn't just me.  Everyone at our table independently noticed how tasteless things were until eventually one person said what everyone else was thinking.  You could blindfold me and could not tell difference between fried shrimp and french fries.\n\nAlso a lack of vegetables.  They had some snow peas that tasted like rubber.  Come one kitchen put some sauces on this food!\n\nI really wanted to like this place because so I could go to a chinese buffet and not get grossed out that the people cooking my food were using that dirty bathroom.  But I hate to say it I think I will take enjoying the food over enjoying the bathroom...\n\nI will give it one more shot at some point based on some of the other reviews so look for an update...  but not anytime soon.\n"]
179.Atrium Cafe,[u"Decent variety of options that taste just okay. There's a selection of wraps hot/cold sandwiches and pizzas on one end. The wraps are occasionally swapped out for an Indian or Chinese entree. There is a salad bar soups/chili pots small selection of dim sum in the middle. Then there's cold packaged sandwiches bland sushi and packaged snacks on another end. Prices are decent but portions can be a little bit more generous. (I get hungry fast after eating a whole wrap.)\n\nThe cashier lines can get long during lunch rush hour. If you're an MBA student you can sign up for the Executive Meal Plan which is a pre-paid plan that gives you a discount and no tax on purchases.\n\nThe one thing that annoys me the most about this place is that they close around 2 PM.\n\nTerrace Cafe across the street in the Statler Hotel has much better food and longer hours of operation.\n" u'Waaaay too pricey for the taste and quantity. I would recommend eating at Terrace across the street\n' u"This past semester I think I must have dropped $500 in total on lunches at the Atrium Cafe.  They've got an awesome selection of sandwiches pizza soups and a fresh salad bar with all the fixin's.  \n\nI usually got the Korean bulgogi beef wrap or a large salad which by the way they don't even charge by weight.  You get charged a flat price for a small or large container and if you're like me pile on as much meat as you can until it starts to topple over and people give you weird looks.  God I love meat so much.  Come to think of it my salads are probably not technically salads since they have no lettuce in them.\n\nUsually there's more seating at the Atrium Cafe than at Mac's Cafe across the street at Statler.  Nicer ambiance too with more spacious professional tables and a great glass atrium to sit beneath.  Eat here if you want to avoid the undergrad masses at Mac's Cafe.\n"]
24.Coltivare,[u'My son was vising from Brooklyn and likes to try out new places in Ithaca since he grew up here. He suggested this place and he and my wife and I went for dinner and were very glad we did.\n\nWe knew there was some kind of tie-in to TC3 (Tompkins County Community College for you out-of-towners) so I asked the floor manager about that and we got a very informative and pleasant discourse on that tie-in. Turns out TC3 is one of only 4 community colleges in the country that has this kind of set-up. Basically the place is run by TC3 as a learning facility for their students BUT most of the floor staff is professional help (some of whom are TC3 graduates) and only a fairly small number of TC3 students are working there at any one time. We also appreciated the "farm fresh" food using local farmers products where possible.\n\nWe had other discussions with staff members and they were unfailingly polite helpful and informative.\n\nI particularly liked the decor. Raw brick walls and lots of spacious window and a high ceiling make for a very pleasant experience in the dining area. The bar on the other hand is a mix of overly "rustic" on the one hand with the vertical front being rough planks and "trendy" on the other hand with purple lighting making that vertical front look a bit out of place. I asked a staff person about it and he said it was a deliberate attempt to attract folks walking past since the large windows give a good view of bar and at night the lighting looks trendy.\n\nMy wife and son greatly enjoyed their meals and felt that the wine list was very good and the wines they tried were pleasant. The bread put out before the meal was quite good. I\'m a big fan of bread and particularly enjoyed that (and hogged most of it but they know that if the bread is good they aren\'t going to get much). The presentations of the entrees and deserts was definitely high end very attractive and we all enjoyed everything.\n\nI had a hamburger and putin sort of. I\'m a very oddly picky eater and basically said "I\'ll have the burger in a bun on one plate the putin fries on another plate and do what you will with the gravy and cheese curds as long as they don\'t get anywhere near me". Picky as I said.  Anyway the spiced fries were outstandingly good and plentiful.\n\nThe service was very good prompt and courteous throughout. The portions were a bit on the small side. My burger was definitely NOT undersized but my son could have happily eaten a bit more than he got.  BUT ... this is a nice restaurant not a fast food place. Their goal is quality not quantity and they do a good job of it and we were all content with what we got.\n\nIt was perhaps a bit on the pricey side for Ithaca but my son pointed out that given the decor and the quality of the meals it would have been laughably under-priced for Brooklyn to say nothing of Manhattan.\n\nThere is a very nice looking special events area across the hall from the bar / dining area and although it was empty when we were there I can believe the other reviews here which praise it.\n\nOne thing that I particularly noticed was that while we were there there were two other tables in sight that had one or more young children but the only reason I knew that was because I looked around. There were no loud kid sounds at all so had I not looked I would never have known they were there and that\'s the way I like it.\n\nThe one jarring note for me was the hostess podium just outside the restaurant entrance. This was so "rustic" as to be kitschy with alternately curved barrel staves all around in a decidedly ugly layout.\n\nAnyway we all three recommend it.\n' u'This is a tough review to write because there are so many mixed things going on at Coltivare. \n\nThe food is generally top-notch and they are a leader in the local farm-to-table scene in Ithaca. They also partner with a local college and many local farms which is great. At any given time their menu features a wide variety of dishes and you\'re sure to encounter something you love any time you go. They also have a good wine selection although that is not really my wheelhouse.\n\n"Some" of their front-of-house operation is good. The hosts are generally attentive and friendly and the other staff are hit or miss. I have found the servers to be rather lackluster seemingly disinterested in their jobs and lacking a passion for the food they are offering. The bar staff is competent but again disinterested. Staff from the kitchen frequently pop their heads out to look into the dining area and make comments which is very unprofessional. Food is often less-than-hot when it arrives at your table as they seem to have an inefficient system of runners or servers. If you sit at the bar you can frequently see dishes sitting in the pass-through window for 5-10 minutes or longer before someone grabs it and delivers it to the table.\n\nI blame most of this on lack of training and inattentive managers. I\'ve been there when the bar is absolutely slammed one harried bartender trying to serve 10-15 customers. The general manager was actually in view of this and just stood around with his hands in his pockets instead of getting involved and not hanging his staff out to dry. No excuse for that and I felt bad for the staff. They\'ve been open long enough to iron out training and staffing issues.\n\nIf you like great food and are willing to tolerate sub-par service and management you might like Coltivare.\n' u'Sooooooo if this is a "teaching" venue then YELP folks let\'s give constructive criticism and not tear them to pieces shame on some of you......\n\nFlat bread of the day  pear Gorgonzola bacon\n\nPumpkin french toast I heard was good but it had local mini kiwi on it and I\'m allergic to kiwi so I didn\'t partake\n\nBiscuits and gravy had a good consistency and flavor the biscuits were like drop biscuits and oddly came sitting in mashed potatoes\n\nBenedict also oddly had mashed potatoes. \n\nCroque Madame reportedly good\n\nApple burger cooked as ordered big enough to share\n\nBLT delicious\n\nLamb meatballs tender and flavorful\n\nFinger lakes chicken sandwich thought it would be fried but it was well grilled and juicy.\n\nApricot butter buttermilk scones w currents pumpkin bread carrot bread\n' u"Went to Coltivare for dinner for the first time last night and I will most certainly be back. Service was wonderful and the ambiance was welcoming and modern. I've been meaning to try this place for a while but had heard mixed review when it first opened and so waited for some of the kinks in the process to be worked out. \n\nSince it was Thursday night dinner options included a small tapas menu - 5 dishes $5 each. There were suggested wine options for the tapas menu along with a limited beer menu for the night because of a beer tasting that they had going on as well. If nothing else I was delighted to hear of the variety of different food/drink-related activities going on within the restaurant as it demonstrates that they're working to keep up the educational aspect of the restaurant as well as offering variety to visitors. \n\nI'm a fan of tapas but also wanted to try one of the main dishes. Instead of ordering an appetizer I ordered the brown butter mushrooms with a porcini meringue to start. My mother who had come to dinner with me opted for the spicy butternut squash soup with walnut butter cr\xe8me fra\xeeche. I tried the soup and expected a bit more spice but it was a tasty soup. The brown butter mushrooms with a porcini meringue tapas dish was a nice inventive little tapas dish that I would certainly order again. My regret is not also ordering the buckwheat pasta ravioli with caramelized cranberry chutney and parsnip squash puree to go WITH my brown butter mushroom dish... but then again I had to save room for my main course.\n\nFor the main course my mother ordered the rigatoni with sausage creamy tomato sauce and peas... a fairly classic pasta dish. Being a fan of white beans I ordered the duck confit with farro and white bean rag\xf9. I'm not generally a huge fan of duck but I was sold because of the rag\xf9. Surprisingly I really enjoyed the dish... not greasy (which I usually associate with duck) and the farro/white bean combination was very enjoyable. I'd certainly recommend it. \n\nAll in all I'm very happy with my dinner at Coltivare. I'd like to try lunch here at some point or brunch. The lamb meatballs with roasted red peppers feta cheese croutons and local yogurt sound like something I'd love to try. The Finger Lake Chicken Sandwich also sounds tempting with cranberry goat cheese and apple fennel salad. There are plenty of choices on the various and evolving farm to table menus. \n\nTL; DR  Between the modern atmosphere delightful/knowledgable staff and the variety of farm to table options I'll be back.\n" u"Coltivare was delicious and everyone we interacted with there was so friendly and helpful. Six of my family members and I ate there on New Years Eve and we really enjoyed that they offered a special NYE menu alongside their regular menu - something for everyone and they were super great about accommodating my husband's Celiac disease. Wonderful dining concept where everything is local and the restaurant / kitchen is also a teaching space - our server was 19 years old but very professional and obviously knew what he was talking about. Everything we tried was delicious and creative including the special NYE drinks. I had one of the specials of the night a vegetarian dish of three grilled beet planks over a barley risotto - the crispy kale on top was INCREDIBLE.\n" u'Good stuff:\n-The decor is fantastic really trendy and cool.\n-Service was very friendly enthusiastic and helpful.\n-I love how so much of the food is local and seasonal. \n-I loved the grilled romaine ($9). It was charred perfectly (just slightly) and the dressing and local goat cheese was delicious. \n-I enjoyed the two wild yeast flatbreads that we tried. The black olive ($16) was my favorite---you could tell that it had fresh ingredients like high quality olives and fresh mozz. \n\nSome suggestions:\n-The eggyball flatbread ($14) was good but I wish the eggplant "meatballs" had more eggplant flavor; they seemed to be mostly breading. Also they seemed more like small pizzas than what I would call "flatbreads." \n\nOverall I liked the food at our recent lunch here and it would have been 5 stars if not for the fact that it seemed overpriced for lunch.\n' u'Came here for my birthday dinner. We ate too much before we came but we still ordered an apple fennel salad mussels in pork reduction and the eggplant "meatball" flatbread. \nEverything was good. Particularly loved the salad dressing and the mussels. The flatbread was basically pizza (which you can\'t go wrong with). I kind of wish the eggplant "meatballs" were more flavorful but I guess I can\'t expect it to taste like a real meatball.\nI also liked the complimentary bread basket which had these little cheese bread puffs as well. They refilled it as soon as we ran low (which I greatly appreciate).\n\nI think my favorite part of the dinner was the dessert and the service. They checked up on us regularly but not too often. They explained the specials and the people were all really personable: the host the server and the manager (I think he was a manager). The food came out all at once which may explain why it took a little longer than we expected.\nWe were full to the point of bursting but I\'m so glad we didn\'t skip dessert. We ordered this olive oil gelato with hazelnut meringue that was to die for. There was some candied lemon peel too and the combination was fantastic. \nWe also ordered a dessert wine (harvest riesling) which was way too sweet and syrupy for my taste but if ice wine is your thing you\'ll enjoy it.\n\nUnfortunately it was a little pricey and the portions were sort of small. I wouldn\'t be able to come here (I\'m a poor college student) for a regular casual dinner but we were considering bringing our families here for graduation. Hoping to come again and try other things on the menu.\n\nPS: there\'s an American Gothic painting with rakes by the bathroom. I thought it was cute and took a picture with them.\n' u'The chef was very accommodating to my food allergies and made me feel safe! My meal was delicious. The waiter was very attentive. I highly recommend this restaurant!\n' u"So I really loved the concept of Coltivare the space the farm-to-table food - so I kept giving it more chances. Plus it's a great place to meet professors - on a couple of lunch occasions Coltivare really won me back. I would highly recommend it for lunch and brunch. \n\nThere are lunch deals with a wrap and a soup or salad and a flatbread. These are all great and generously portioned. I don't think I mentioned the desserts here last time but they are phenomenal. The last thing I ate that I can't stop talking about is a phylo-crusted creme brulee. All of the concepts of a good creme brulee are there: the first crisp crack and then a cream that melts on your tongue. The phylo skin is such a smart alternative and you would never know that there was this amazing cream just ready to oozeeeeeee out calling you to eat it. \n\nThe last time I was here as a little cherry on top to a good lunch with my advisor was a tour of the kitchen and learning space. Just ask!! It's so great to learn exactly where your food is coming from the concept behind it and see the faces of people cooking your food. Aim for a time when they aren't so busy and you'll enjoy it even if the food was just okay. \n\nGlad we had that heart-to-heart Colti. I'll be seeing you again. ;)\n" u"I live in San Diego currently but I am a native of Ithaca so every new restaurant that opens I am sure to stop by!\nThis place is gorgeous inside rustic with a modern touch. The banquet/large party rooms are nicely done with portable bars - not so hotel-y which is good. Coltivare is also a teaching restaurant with a connection to TC3 (which is awesome) and a true farm-to-table establishment.\n\nI came in with friends to simply have snacks at the bar! Tim was awesome an old-school bartender who knows his drinks and is also incredibly funny! \nLouise made me I had a Blackberry Margarita it was so good and she was awesome!\n\nWe ordered poutin - who doesn't like fries gravy and cheese curds?!?! It was really tasty.\n\nKeep in mind I didn't have the full dining experience I am only reviewing what I experienced. The food was fresh and hot and flavorful. My friends and I enjoyed ourselves and when I am back in town I will be sure to go for dinner!\n\nI have read the other reviews about late service and such sometimes its hard with new restaurants I will update my review when I have a full dining experience.\n" u"Delicious from start to finish with amazing friendly and efficient servers! So happy made an OpenTable reservation and fine this gem of a place! And it's only been open since December 2014 (8 months now).\n\nFarm to Bistro food in a beautiful space and tables nicely spaced apart. Seating indoors and out and an interior wine room and special occasion space too makes this place perfect for all types of celebrations!\n\nStarted with the Finger Lakes Artisanal Cheese plate and that was some of the freshest and tastiest cheese I ever had. Then had the Rosemary-cognac chicken liver mousse with gherkins and country bread toasts along with my Cabernet Sauvignon. Creamy beautifully balanced and flavorful without being overpowering in either herb or cognac mousse -- wish I could take that little Ball Jar of it home! My Sister-in law had the cold BLT soup which was bursting with fresh tomatoes and herb flavor and fresh crispy bacon bits (yummy)! Then we had the salmon with roasted risotto cakes! I dream about that risotto cake it was perfectly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.\n\nOur waitstaff were knowledgeable friendly and good natured (especially after I sent back the first glass of Cabernet I felt had turned). They delivered the next glass after informing me they would open a fresh bottle. It was lush and delish.\n\nHappy to return on our next trip up to Ithaca!\n" u"We found a Gem in Ithaca.\n\nHelene was our server she took time to explain menu items.  Was attentive to our needs.  Nice job Helene.\n\nThe warm cornbread with seasoned butter before and during dinner was a nice touch.\n\nThe food is fantastic.  I order the pasta special.  It was delicious and hot during the whole meal.\n\nMy companions order the free range chicken.  Nice presentation and delicious.  They both won the clean plate award.\n\nOnly downside was $12.50 for a martini and $8.00 for a small glass of wine.\n\nWe will have pre-dinner cocktails somewhere else before returning.\n\nA must try don't pass this one up.\n" u"My husband and I had a reservation at Coltivare \nRestaurant.  We arrived on time and was seated.\nWe waited for awhile a waiter never came to take our order.  We watched as other patrons were seated and their orders taken.  We are a mixed couple we couldn't understand why we were ignored.  After feeling that there was an obvious problem from the wait staff we decided to leave.  This is not the type of non service  or treatment anyone should suffer.  We told the hotess our feelings as we left no one was concern.  You be the judge we felt we were treated with prejudice.  Shame on them!\n" u'Ugh the lemon ricotta pancakes are so terrible!  I\'ve never had to send food back before but these were inedible.  Then the next batch came out and they were STILL inedible!  And then they comped my OJ.  Yay.  \n\nAlso went with a party of 6 recently.  SLOW service.  4 people liked their entrees 2 did not.  Upon leaving one person remarked "this place could be a solid 7."  I think that\'s the expectation you need to go in with.  At best they could be a 7.  \n\nBTW Purity has ricotta pancakes and they\'re great (you can\'t get a mimosa there though).  Dewitt Cafe also usually has a pancake on Sundays and they\'re perfection.  I mean honestly - pancakes are naturally both easy and delicious.  How can Coltivare mess these up??\n\nI do however like their other brunch items.  I\'ll be skipping dinner for a while - too much money considering there\'s a 20% chance something will be terrible.  I\'d rather go to Gola Osteria pay less money and be guaranteed to LOVE everything I eat.\n' u'I attended a conference in Ithaca and this where the group went for dinner.  It was a quick walk from our hotel. There were approximately 12 in the group and we were seated in a room called the "Wine Cellar." The decor was warm relaxing and winey. The chandelier in the Wine Cellar was made from wine bottles. \n\nThe menu was chosen for the group. I had the Artisanal Salad the New York Strip and the Phyllo-Wrapped Creme Breulee. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful. The good was very good. My only complaint is that my steak was slightly over cooked. The phyllo was an interesting addition to the creme breulee but it worked very will together. \n\nThe good was good and the company was entertaining.  Overall  a most enjoyable meal.\n' u"This is yet another farm to table trendy place with average food and rustic environment. Went there on a week night so it wasn't crowded. Food was okay. They take reservations through Open Table but the restaurant was literally empty and we could've just walked in.\n" u"We tried cultivare for the first time this week and went back the next evening because it was such a terrific and reasonably priced experience. The farm to table food concept is at its best at cultivare and you can't beat the happy hour pricing! Shout out to chef Michael for the great work here the restaurant is run in partnership with TC3! Well done.\n" u"I brought my mother here for their special Mother's Day brunch and it was amazing! They gave her a flower when we checked in and it was a special buffet style set up with such great selection (including cheeses smoked meat warm sirloin & beef raspberry french toast omelette station etc.) with a to die for dessert station (creme brulee lemon bars brownies tons of muffins and cakes checkerboard cookies puddings). \n\nThe decor is very farm to fresh esque with a light and airy vibe. We had excellent service the whole time. I am still thinking about the creme brulee it was top notch quality. Whoever sets up the food made everything look just too cute it was absolutely perfect and in my opinion about 10000 times tastier and more elegant than Taverna Banfi brunch which is usually our go to nicer option. I will definitely be returning to try dinner sometime. A great experience.\n" u"We went for our anniversary dinner love the connection to our local community college. It was a Sunday night so it wasn't very busy. Our bartender was very attentive and you could tell he clearly loves his job. For starters I had the local artisan cheese plate and my wife had the pumpkin  creme bruleeboth were awesome. The waitress was great and had an awesome personality. We both had the special which was seafood Primavera that was light and fresh. For desserts I had the chocolate  trifle and she had the free   form apple pie and both were great. I am very critical of service and food  quality when I decide to hand over my hard earned money Colivare did not disappoint we will definitely be back.\n" u"We had a welcome dinner for our families the night before our wedding at Coltivare. We were unbelievably happy with the results! We worked with Lauren the catering and events manager to plan the event. Lauren is fantastic! She really listened to what we had in mind and made great recommendations. She was very accommodating when it came to food allergies. All of the food was delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful. One item we chose was a pasta station which was a huge hit with everyone. The event room was decorated very tastefully with Fall flowers. It's a great space with lots of windows to the outdoors. You can also see across into the restaurant area which has a really pretty bar. It doesn't have that claustrophobic closed-off feel that a lot of event spaces have. I highly recommend Coltivare for a special event!\n"]
13.MIX Social Dining,[u"Givin' it 5 stars. Decor (pretty ugly and goofy and nothing goes with anything else including the carpet) notwithstanding. \n\nWalked in with no reservation on a Friday night. No trouble being seated right away but place was still busy. 3/4 full.  Cocktails are Delicious.  We had dirty martinis and a specialty called sweet Georgia brown.  Nice interesting selection of cocktails offered. \n\nSmall plates are my favorite style of eating.  A little bit of a lot of different flavors and that's what we had. Grilled octopus was tender and flavorful. Bacon wrapped dates with bleu cheese could be a dessert. Purple sticky rice balls with char sui pork were sweet and tender and very lightly fried. Not heavy. Mix Caesar salad was outrageous with crispy wontons. Mussels Thai style were amazing. The broth should be a soup. We asked for it to be slightly spicy. And it was perfect. \n\nBut wait. We pigged out on dessert too! We had a trio of mini mixed berry compote with oatmeal crust and vanilla ice cream vanilla and hazelnut panacotta and chocolate bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. Holy!  All really delicious and all made by Mix.  She even came to the table twice to see how we were doing. Really nice service all evening. \n\nTiramisu martini was somehow light considering the 8 different alcohol varieties in it. lol. \n\nWe got carried away and had to take home a slice of turtle cheesecake. They have several varieties to choose from. And all for $120. \n\nCannot be beat. My new favorite spot. Ithaca has many really good restaurants and some are quite pricey but Mix is very good and reasonably priced with friendly service.  \n\nThe decor needs to go....very soon.  But other than that definitely check it out.\n" u"Hubby and I went to MIX tonight to celebrate our anniversary and we wondered why we waited so long to try it. We had a wonderful experience. Service was impeccable and the chef came out at the end of our meal to see how we enjoyed the dishes. It was a lovely touch.\n\nWe started with cocktails I had the Italian Job. A nice blend of lemoncello campari and other citrus flavors it was a little strong on the grapefruit juice but I like citrus so I enjoyed it. While we were waiting for our first dish the chef sent out a complimentary amuse bouche: it was like a bite-size pizza--pepperoni encased in chewy dough and one of the most flavorful marinara sauces we've had (rivaling Gola Osteria's!). Delicious. We started with Cheesy bread so fluffy and served with a cup of the delicious marinara. Arrancini and meatballs were next and to die for. I wanted to try the Crockpot Guajillo tacos and this one was a little bit of a miss for me. The flavors were good but not out-of-this-world like the first three. Still the meat was tender and the taco shells which were an unusual gyzo pasta were crispy and light.\n\nBy now we'd realized we had ordered way too much food but we soldiered on with the Sriracha Buttermilk fried chicken and Hanoi Waffles. This one was another bit of a miss for me in term of the flavors--it was a little too sweet but perfectly cooked. The waffle was tender with a lovely hint of vanilla.\n\nWe were stuffed but the last dish Angus Sliders were so good tender and perfectly cooked. They were served with hot crispy pommes frites and a delicious aioli.\n\nMIX recommends 2-3 dishes per person to pass. We would have been fine with a dish apiece plus the cheesy bread. Still the menu is inventive and presentation elevated so it was hard to choose. I will say that the owners did wonders transforming the old Lucatelli restaurant into a sleek comfortable space. We will definitely be back.\n" u"I had eaten at Mix once before and was so favorably impressed that I went back on Christmas eve and had an even more exceptional experience! Not only is the food delicious but the menu is unique and well presented and the service is great. And they have tall tables which I happen to love. \n\nOn Xmas eve the owner came out to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and even though it was late and we were the last table she bought us a round of drinks. We ended up staying well after closing but the staff never made us feel like we were putting them out. \n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant for it's food service and ambiance!\n" u"I have to say that this place is definitely what Ithaca needed! Small plates that does a twist on tbe classics! Unlike Spanish tapas these small plates range in classic American fare to international. The chef always sends out small samples which is nice to be the first to taste what might make the menu. I've dined here twice and ordered in twice on Ithaca to go. The food is hearty and tasty. You will love this place!!!\n" u"First time tonight. With wife & 2 friends. Nice interesting atmosphere. I like the chandeliers. Waitress Ashlee was very nice and helpful! Food was delicious!!! Now I have only been to a few tapas places and this one rocks!!! Had the walnut rosemary salmon with Brussels & sweet potatoes oh WOW this was Excellent! Then the Guajillo Short Rib Tacos these were very tasty & yummy too! Then the Hibachi steak skewers. With a cold noodle side. The meat was flavorful. The noodles were tasty. (I'm really picky about my steak so take this as it is) there were too many fat strands running through the one skewer I had.(the others didn't have any issue though!) Like I said the meat was very tasty.  Then the last one and it was worth the wait. The Short Rib slider was awesome! I wasn't expecting a huge piece of short Rib but these were huge for a slider. I was very pleasantly surprised! So my ranking is 1) Salmon 2) Short Rib Slider 3) Short Rib taco 4) steak skewer. We had a nice evening and will definitely be back!!!\n" u'An awesome new restaurant (to us) with easy parking where parents can take their college student or wine tasters can enjoy a special but reasonably priced meal! Something for everyone! The dishes are made to share and it is truly a lot of fun to be able to experience multiple dishes from the menu. We had a hard time choosing and you will too because the dishes are as delectable as they sound!  Unique blends of flavors. We loved dinner so much we went back for Sunday brunch! Friendly waitstaff and a comfy outdoor seating area! Not to be missed if you are in or near Ithaca!\n' u"I have been looking forward to visiting Mix and maybe my expectations were just too high.  I'll make this quick.  \n\nPros:  Great martinis loved the stemless glasses.  My dining pal had the Cherry Bang Bang and a little sip told me it was literally Christmas in a glass.  Delicious. Hummus served while we waited was very good. Caesar salad was fresh crunchy and a real palate-pleaser in my opinion.  I liked that it was served chopped and piled high on a plate instead of the usual presentation.   \n\nCons:  Strong stench of bleach upon entry.  Bathrooms look the same as they always have.  Tacky decor paired with odd music.  A raw bar you're not allowed to see at least I didn't see it.  If someone knows where it is please point it out to me.  Tiny expensive oysters.   Shrimp Avocado Toast would have been really good if the toast wasn't soggy.   Lastly...and it is the absolute deal breaker for me:  During September when tomatoes are abundant ripe and fantastic we were served hard pink-white middle-of-January tomatoes with the Roasted Beet/Tomato Salad with Burrata.  Blank stare from server when it was mentioned.  There is no excuse for sad vegetables at this time of year especially in the Finger Lakes.  Call up a local farm...Wegmans even...and get some nice heirlooms before serving sickly tomatoes for gods sake.  I suspect the beets were boiled but I'm not 100% sure.  The burrata resembled bird poop.  Picture attached.\n" u"Had a fantastic time prior to the hockey game a couple of weeks ago.  We showed up as a group and shared quite a number of foods.  The Thai Mussels and the Swordfish were exceptional although the rest of the foods was also excellent.  The owner is the chef and she came out during our meal to ensure that everything was OK something that's always appreciated.  \n\nDefinitely would return a unique restaurant in Ithaca.\n" u"Kudos to this place for being new and trying to bring some nightlife to Ithaca. A million stars for that. Overall though I think my excitement exceeded my experience here. If it were cheaper I'd go back. But the prices are more big-city while the plates are more of what you'd find in the suburbs: kinda greasy chain food that's trying to be fancier than it is. \n\nPro:\n - awesome service\n - great menu selection (and unique!)\n - some food is great (corn dogs and short rib tacos were pretty solid)\n - margarita isn't too bad\n\nCons:\n - high prices\n - the crowd is distractingly casual\n - some food was not so great (deviled eggs were confusing and the tempura was slimy)\n - old classics on the radio (it doesn't really match their vibe)\n - overall it just lacks the atmosphere I was hoping for\n" u"I went for dinner with my mom. We loved the restaurant because of the choices of tapas. We like to share food so it was perfect. I liked that the type of tapas on the menu. They were a kind of fusion type tapas. The food was delicious! The chef/owner stopped by our table t\xf3male sure we liked our food. She was very nice. I'm not from the area but the next time I'm in town I will go back there again.\n" u"We got to experience the Mix with friends last week.\nIts was truly awesome! The food the drinks and the atmosphere The mix has it all!!\nGreat people!! Great Food!! can't wait to go back!!\n" u'A gigantic menu but everything we ordered was very well done! A great place to go with friends who like a wide variety of food. Service was great. Moderately expensive so probably a special occasion kind of place. My favorite was the curry deviled eggs!\n' u'Absolutely delicious both dinner AND brunch. Food was fantastic and service was very professional and attentive.\n' u"Mix Social Dining is the newest and in my opinion the best restaurant in Ithaca and all of CNY!\nLocally owned and operated by two great chefs with a large menu that features ingredients from all over the world in his newly renovated iconic hotspot that once housed Locatelli's on Elmira Rd for 40 plus years.  \nIt's a stunning space that has been transformed into a modern haute decorated with locally created visually stunning artwork & colorful blown glass sculptures. \nMix has a very pleasant & well trained staff that guided us thru this eclectic menu.  \nWe started at the oyster bar for some great freshly shucked shellfish selections and moved into the main dining room for dinner.  After being spoiled with the great cuisine we stopped into the lively bar for an after dinner drink that featured local wine & spirits with a great drink menu.\nA beautiful display of house made creative cheesecakes lured us into ordering Togo desserts that didn't disappoint.\nIn my opinion a must see and taste restaurant that is worth every penny and travel time.\n" u'We had a great meal at Mix. The food is incredibly diverse--inckuding Asian Russian and Mexican options--served in small portions so you can try many different flavors. We had dates wrapped in bacon that melted in your mouth purple sticky rice dumplings that were crispy and filling stroganoff that was rich and savory and a plate with three different types of desserts (creme br\xfbl\xe9e berry crumble and bread pudding) plus tasty cocktails.\n\nThe staff is attentive and friendly and the setting is fun. You can start out in a bar area at the front of the house and then move to the main dining area and then retire to coaches by a fireplace for dessert. Highly recommended!\n' u"Mix Social Dining is what Ithaca had been missing.\nWe decided to go small plates for the whole table and we were a party of 12. The servers were attentive and informed. The diversity of food choices were incredible we ate around the world. Each plate was perfectly prepared with the skill and precision that we've come to expect from the highest caliber establishments. Perfect for a large party or an intimate dinner for two.\n5 stars are never given they are earned.\n" u'I was at Mix last night for a holiday party.  The food was set up buffet style.  Everything was delicious the employees were all very friendly and the place is beautiful.  I will definitely return.  Thanks for making our evening great!!\n' u"This is now one of my favorite spots for a meal or a cocktail in Ithaca. For me its up there with Maxi's Just a Taste Madeline's and the now defunct Fine Line. Broad menu -  well prepared and creative. Really enjoyed the duck quesadillas. Fairly priced good quality wine list good cocktail bar and even a raw fish bar. Its located in the old Locatelli's and I have to say that they've done a really nice job bringing the space up to date.. With downtown getting harder and harder to navigate for parking I think this will quickly become my go to spot in town. Four stars only because I found the server a bit hard to pin down the night we were there. Otherwise she was friendly and attentive.\n" u"I so wish I could give it more stars. Our dining experience was one of the best ever for me. \n\nThe menu items are delivered as small 4 bite samples of amazing combinations of ingredients that are new bright and make your tongue swoon. \n\nThere were 3 of us in our party and while we didn't agree on our favorite we did agree that the adventure was one we will definitely repeat.\n\nIf you're in the area treat yourself to some of the best Ithaca has to offer (and Ithaca has a lot to offer!!).\n" u"This is the new best restaurant in town! The ambiance  the service and the food were exceptional. It's California cuisine meets tapas and the deserts were excellant. Everyone come enjoy and keep this restaurant going!!!\n"]
175.Easy Wok,[u'Tasty Chinese food nice and friendly staff. My boyfriend and I often come to ithaca mall and specially choose to eat here. Compared with any other local Chinese restaurants they have cheaper price but more yummy food. Would definitely  recommended.\n']
152.West Tower Elevator,[]
132.Due Amici Ristorante,[u"Went here today for lunch. Our group included two adult women and four small preschoolers. We ordered a large pizza half cheese /half greek and two fountain sodas.  The interior is clean and simple with good music playing (stuff you can't help but sing along to).  Service was at the register and was efficient and friendly.\n\nI asked if they do delivery. The woman at the register said yes. I asked if there was a take home menu. No. Though there is a large sign at the entry showing what they offer once you go inside it is not obvious where you can find a menu. Turns out there are two small menus around the register but if there is another patron there you cannot access them without being totally rude. Also she begins talking to you and taking your order while the other patron is still settling up their bill. Just awkward.\n\nOur food came out quickly...within the estimated 10 minutes. The pizza seemed smaller than expected and the cheese side was thin and meager. The Greek side was plump with toppings though. \n\nEnd result: the pizza was bland and not enough to serve our group. The salad was decent. Though they have garlic powder italian spice mix salt and pepper available there was no parm shaker...at all. \n\nWorst issue...the fountain sodas were all completely flat. I watched two people notice this after getting their drinks and then walking out with stink face. Another couple of folks ordered drinks though nothing was said about the soda being flat. I went to the register to kindly let her know the soda machine was out of gas. She said she knew because another customer had let her know. She said they would be fixing it later that day. Awkward silence. I told her we had ordered two drinks   but were unable to drink them because they were flat. She finally offered to replace them with canned sodas they had in a display frig.\n\nThree stars for being clean friendly and prompt. \n\nMaybe they are just new to the restaurant/pizza business and will improve with time. For now I will stick with Sammy's.\n" u'This is a disgusting front of an establishment. These twisted mfs can smd. (middle finger emoji) fuck these scumbags.\n']
65.Tokyo Hibachi Sushi & Asian Bistro,[u'Huge restaurant. Nice ambiance. We ordered of the menu having hibachi sushi and teriyaki. Everything was fresh and crisp and well prepared. The service was super solicitous- we had to protect our almost empty plates a bit but we never wanted for anything. The whole family enjoyed it.\n' u"Had a good experience. I want to start off by saying the employees but specifically our server are very kind and hospitable. She checked on us constantly and always had a warm smile. I must admit it was a slow start. 10 minutes to receive our drinks 5 more minutes to place our orders. But to be fair she had other tables to attend to. Another small pet peeve I had was it was slightly warmer in the restaurant a bit outside my comfort level. I checked the thermostat and it read 81...Our server brought over 3 Miso Soups which only one was supposed to come with an order. It was a very nice gesture but truthfully the soup was too salty for my tastes. \nThen came the Steak Teriyaki out on a sizzling plate. Cooked to a medium rare tender and tasted great with the sauce and onions underneath. We then ordered a variety of nigiri. Yellow-Tail Salmon Tuna Albacore Tuna Smoked Salmon Mackerel Scallop and Striped Bass. Each slice of fish were very generous which was great. The rice underneath weren't quite formed or unified with the fish so it easily came apart when picked up. Each piece were very fresh and delicious. The Yellow-Tail Albacore Tuna and Striped Bass were the highlights. We also wanted to try a special roll so we chose the 'Tokyo' roll. Wrapped with soy paper and flavors worked well together. Very well done. \nOverall this is the best sushi restaurant I've found in Ithaca NY so far...the service was great food tasted great and I'd gladly return.\n" u"When it comes to eating out I tend to stay away from buffets.  Being in town to visit my parents and they wanted to come here so I was dragged along.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Our server was polite and quick to our drinks refilled.  As to the buffet...a lot of options with all of your typical Americanized Chinese dishes along with Sushi some more American items like chicken wings and more Americanized dessert options.  The food was hot and fresh and definitely didn't taste like it sits around under the heat lamps for long.  I definitely left full and this is a buffet I would go back to.\n" u'0 stars. \n\nI don\'t often write reviews (and I acknowledge that I should do so more especially when the service is good) but this experience was so beyond abysmal that I have to review. \n\nWe ordered food about 10 minutes till 7 pm. "Our food" was not delivered for an hour and ten minutes (plus). Then as soon as we opened it we knew it was wrong. We ordered steak tuna tartare rolls and gyoza...we were given soup and an unidentifiable breaded meat. We called the restaurant promptly to report the mis-delivery and were told we would be contacted shortly when it was sorted out. \n\n15 minutes later we called back never being contacted by the restaurant. We were told that there were "priority customers" ahead of us who had to be served first. It was past one and a half hours since we ordered . . . \n\nWe said we would pick it up if a discount was provided in 15 minutes. After much back and forth (that we could over-hear on the phone) they agreed. My husband drove down to pick it up. The restaurant was empty and the food was not ready 20 minutes later. \n\nI have no idea how this "shop" can be rated highly. We will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau.\n' u'Decent place but nothing special. Came for my daughters bday & think our local place in NYC is better. Service was friendly but rushed (like they gave us the check without us even asking for it). They also added a tip and made it seem mandatory we pay - really?????   On the other hand The complementary spring roles were nice.  Wine selection was pretty bad tho.  Overall ok but would not bother revisiting\n' u'Very slow service. Went for lunch and took 5 minutes to be seated with only one other table occupied and then an additional 10 minutes to be waited on.  \nWhen finally served the waitress kept trying to take my plate before I was finished. \nSalad was older and wilting while the sushi was lacking in flavor.  \nThe soup was good though. \nAn additional 10 minutes for the check to come after finishing. \nReturning late to work from lunch due to wait times.\n' u"This place is a hot mess. I called about 2 hours before arrival to reserve a large party of 7-8 people for Hibachi because we've never had/experienced Hibachi before. We arrived to the restaurant on-time and was seated at a grill with another small party (aka shared the grill). Keep in mind the Hibachi part of the restaurant was empty and the way we were seated half of my party could not see the grill/performance. Ding #1. We requested to be seated at another grill and thankfully they were able to accommodate. Performance was fine but dinner was overall lackluster. Food was salty but the chef was very heavy with the soy sauce use. \n\nThe most annoying part was the end. The waitress gave us the wrong check twice. Ding #2. It took over 10 minutes to run the card (keep in mind the restaurant was not busy and it appeared that there were enough staff/waitress around to care for the limited amount of patrons present) and then waitress came back to ask us if we received the card yet (say what?!?) .. Ding #3. I came here because of the strong reviews of the food wait staff etc .. But I guess it's best not to rely on Yelp too much.\n" u"Food (5/5): Delicious high-quality proteins cooked perfectly with flavorful sauces. The included shrimp in my hibachi chicken dinner was a little cold in some parts but that was the only less than stellar aspect of my meal. My girlfriend had the steak benton box and the steak was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. The pork gyoza was also the most flavorful I've had with both the outside and inside bursting with authentic tastes.\n\nService (2/5): We arrived at 6:30 pm on a weekday night and were asked to wait for a table. The hostess never actually greeted us at the hosting stand but yelled from the register about 15 feet away. When our table was actually ready she hastily asked us to follow her and bolted ahead towards the dining area out of sight around the corner where there were multiple open tables. It took another 5 minutes for our waitress to appear and get our drink order and then we waited even longer to place our actual order. When I asked about the free appetizer digital coupon from checking-in the waitress said they only accept those for the main hibachi area. We thought we were going to be seated in the main hibachi area initially and were never asked our preference so this was a little disappointing especially since the prices are the same. I will say that we had another girl who waited on us that would constantly refill our drinks and ask about the food so that was the only redeeming service we experienced.\n" u'Very fresh sashimi and delicious sushi. We tried the veggie combo shrimp roll oyster roll white tuna sashimi and kids teriyaki salmon (HUGE portion for a "kids meal"). All good. Sushi presentation was pleasing esthetic-wise though nothing jaw-dropping. Wait staff was friendly and efficient; particularly on a busy Friday night! Tea was hot aromatic and bottomless.\n\nThe dining area has tables for large groups booths for couples/small families and several seats at the sushi bar. Lots of space dark wood panel walls and grey slate floors.  We didn\'t try the hibachi area - it\'s completely separated from the dining area - but it sounded fun. :) \n\nAs with most Japanese restaurants it was clean efficient healthy but on the expensive side for casual dining. Nothing amazing overall but I\'d return when in the mood for sushi!!\n' u"I decided to come back to this restaurant because my sister was in town and because I received a very kind message from the manager saying that the waiter who gave me such poor service last time had been fired. So I thought it only fair to give this place a try again.\n\nThe food is EXCELLENT. The hibachi is really their strong suit here and every element of the meal is absolutely delicious: the soup and salad are tasty (that soup is so flavorful!) the fried rice is delicious the veggies are varied and fresh and the star of the show IS THE FILET MIGNON. Wowowow straight up I've eaten in many major cities in the US and Europe and I have somehow never come across steak that melted in your mouth the way this did... it was like butter I was seriously blown away by how tender and high-quality this meat was. The chicken was juicy and well-cooked but it couldn't compare to that filet mignon I HIGHLY recommend.\n\nAlso got some sushi rolls and they were carefully prepared for presentation as well as taste. The deep-fried roll was cold (it must have been made first and was waiting for the assembly of the other rolls) but the sushi here is definitely among the best in Ithaca. \n\nMost importantly the service was very nice. There were big smiles and friendliness and just the right amount of attentiveness! My water glass was never empty and everyone seemed very pleasant. The ambiance was nice too! Wish I could see it more crowded on a Saturday night. Great job turning me around Tokyo.\n" u"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. We walk in are seated right away. Ordered right away. We got a free appetizer which was the special. The man who made our food was funny and he worked  quickly. The food itself was outstanding. Better than any old hibachi place. Everything was flavored perfectly. It's not too expensive especially for hibachi. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone. The service is also awesome.\n" u"Great service. The sushi is very fresh and the fish is of the best quality. I had the Gangam roll which is wrapped in soy  paper. The texture and temperature were perfect. I love how they have a section on their menu just dedicated to soy-paper wrapped sushi. Plus I checked in and got a free appetizer...can't beat that. I will DEFINITELY BE COMING back.\n" u"Sushi here is very unimpressive. Ordinarily at sushi restaurants if I order a special roll I expect extravagant presentation not something that looks like it came out of a supermarket. And it costs way too much for what you get.\n\nI haven't tried hibachi here but it seemed like the groups who were doing it here were really enjoying it although it was definitely more about the theatrics rather than the actual food.\n\nService is pretty good but the overpriced lackluster food explains why this place is so empty.\n" u"I went to Tokyo for my 21st birthday to do Hibachi with a group of friends on a Sunday evening. Had a fantastic experience! We were the only people in the restaurant for most of the time which normally would put me off but it meant we received the full attention of the staff.\nThe sushi hibachi and other ordered dishes were good not fantastic but the presentation was top notch. The whole routine of hibachi was a lot of fun and they a really neat birthday routine. \nThe ambiance is really nice especially for Ithaca. I don't know if I'd go there all the time for regular meals but it definitely is worth it for a special occasion. Extra points for squirting sake in our mouths!!\n" u"I was on a business trip and sat down alone. Didn't expect too much and ordered spicy tuna roll. It was surprisingly good. Pork gyoza appetizer was good too except the matching sauce was too sweet for me. I could have asked a different sauce I guess but I was rushing to finish my dinner. Overall it was a very pleasant meal.\n" u"We went on a Monday night and are always on the fence about what to order. We happened to be in Ithaca and decided to give this place a try even though we weren't sure if the fish would be fresh.\n\nThe place was deserted- we were the only people inside until we were getting ready to leave (another couple showed up then).\n\nService was great. We decided to get a couple drinks which we thought were overpriced but still ended up being good.\n\nMiso & mushroom soup were tasty. Ocean roll was our least favorite of what we ordered- needed sauce on top or something. Cornell roll was great- unlike anything else we found. Tokyo roll was refreshing. Dancing beef was dry and needed sauce or something. Jumbo veggie roll was a nice twist on the usual sweet potato roll.\n" u'Fresh tasty sushi and hibachi. We tried all sorts of things from the menu and all were quite good especially the tofu teriyaki bento box and udon soup. The wait staff were able to accommodate our large group in no time at all. Reasonably priced good service and a nice space. Will definitely be back!\n' u'They were amazing! The chef was sooo nice & really really fun. The service was wonderful  everyone was so kind& respectful.  The food was so good & the prices were so reasonable.  The restaurant itself was very clean & neat. I would totally go again.\n' u'We had tuna & mango and the hoisin duck wrap for appetizer they are both amazing! I had a similar tuna mango dish in a Cuban restaurant in Florida this one reminded me of the yumminess there! Also the roast duck is probably the best i have had in the entire ithaca region!\n\nWe had a salmon lover entree and the lady lobster roll. Both are delicious too! The only thing is that the rice is a little too dry. But the flavor was great! \n\nHighly recommended!\n' u'We came with a group of 11 for a bachelorette party - the staff was so great: accommodating efficient speedy and they agreed to take a sake bomb with us!  The hibachi food was high quality and our chef was a true pro - great show overall for some first timers.  Overall a wonderful experience & perfectly in line with our expectations.\n']
119.The State Diner,[u"It is what it is.  For diner food it's not bad.  The advantage to places like this is 1. Their affordability 2. Their late-night hours.  We made it in around 10:15 but I'm fairly certain they're 24 Hours.  There was certainly no rush as we ate.  \n\nMy buffalo chicken wrap and fries were tasty.  The fries especially were crispy well-done without being brown and I would say they were the best part of the meal. The chicken inside of the tenders was appetizing though there wasn't a wealth of it there.  The wrap fell apart on me but that comes with the territory.  Their buffalo sauce was flavorful but not especially noticeable within the entire wrap.  \n\nIt's a local haut where men gather to watch tv and talk to one another at night.  \n\nTheir staff is incredibly friendly and our waitress knew the menu inside and out.  They cook the hot food right in front of you and our chef talked to us a bit too.\n" u'Unassuming delicious food with a nostalgic sensibility. The State Diner delivers on what you would expect out of a typical American diner. (10/15/16)\n\nFood 4/5 | Atmosphere 3/5 | Service 5/5 | Value 3/5\nPros: good variety of food great service friendly staff\nCons: some meals have more value than others price matches quality of food but not atmosphere\n\n----\n\nFood 4/5: (Tuna Melt w/ Fries $10 Souvlaki w/ feta cheese $9)\nI ordered the Tuna Melt on rye bread with fries and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I always order the tuna option when I eat sandwiches and let me tell you this tuna melt was one of the best I\'ve ever had. The rye bread (with hints of dill) was perfectly toasted with butter. The tuna salad itself was a perfect consistency-- not too dry not too wet. The thick cut of swiss cheese with the pickle on the side made the dish complete. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside; well seasoned.\n\nMy partner ordered the Souvlaki with feta ($1 extra) and no tomatoes. The pork was well-cooked and seasoned-- not overly salty as some souvlakis can be. There was a good sauce to meat ratio but there was too much lettuce on top. The pita bread was soft yet had the firm chewy texture one would expect from a good souvlaki. The tzatziki sauce itself was creamy with the right amount of garlic and spices. Combined with the sprinkling of feta cheese on top the dish struck the right balance between tart and creamy.\n\nAtmosphere 3/5\nThe booth seats can be a little uncomfortable as they flip up but are playful and adds a rough charm to the place. The music can be a little loud and depending on your partiality to the style of the music itself can get a bit much. However it\'s still a great atmosphere if you like classic Americana diners. The place feels like a nostalgic timepiece of the past but renovated to accommodate modern needs. Ultimately it\'s a place to "hang out" but not "go out."\n\nService 5/5\nAttentive and friendly staff. Provided refills without prompting. Asked how we were going mid-way. Provided us the check without having to call and proactively asked if we wanted to split or pay the check together. Upon leaving we were given a friendly and genuine "have a great day." Overall we were impressed by the attentiveness of the service staff.\n\nValue 3/5\nSome items have greater value and are more filling than others (the tuna melt with fries + pickle at $10 vs. just souvlaki w/ feta cheese $9) but ultimately the prices are fair. I would recommend getting dishes that include a side.\n' u'Great food nice service and the overall atmosphere is very relaxing and puts you in the perfect mood for the day. No matter what you order it is almost garuanteed you will be satisfied. And the coffee is just as good. Would recommend.\n' u"I have been to this place twice already. Friendly staff. It's a very typical American diner atmosphere. The chairs fold up and there is a coat hanger next to the table to hang your coats. The food is alright. It sure isn't mind blowing but decent. My only issue is that this place is over priced for a diner. Kids eat free on Tuesday but on any other day a meal from the kids menu will cost you $9.00. I am use to paying between $6.00-7.00 for a kids meal. Even an adult meal cost lower than this. Oh well.. I will only come back on Tuesday.\n" u'Was in Ithaca visiting my son and went here on a busy Sunday morning.  It was very crowded when we arrived but we were seated within the time we were told the wait would be - which  a lot of places can\'t get right.  Unfortunately that was the high point.  We waited 35 minutes to get our food and my wife\'s eggs were hard - not soft like she asked.  When the waitress had them red-done she felt compelled to tell my wife that the first plste was cooked properly (it wasn\'t) but "the cook re-did them anyway."  My omlet was cold.\n\nSo - I don\'t think we\'ll be back.\n' u"$4.69 for 1 egg on roll? Manhattan is half that. Asked for ketchup so they made me put it on. Embarrassing for a town diner. The counter/register people are also thieves - looked on their menu and it's listed as $2.69.\n" u"I was in a right state when I ate here. A state of shock a state of panic a new york state of mind call it what you want to.\n\nIt was after a concert in Ithaca and I was with a female friend. We sought out a place to eat and after being unimpressed by Shortstop we ventured here for a late night sit down just before closing.\n\nWe shared a meal because we'd already eaten. Ham Dinner or something thereabouts. It was perfectly pleasing hot juicy tasted homemade. It wasn't the best food we'd ever had but it also wasn't the worst and it hit the spot.\n\nThe service was particularly bad and unfriendly and left a bad taste in our mouths whereas the food did not. Had we received more friendly service I'm sure I could have added an extra star. I do like the food here though.\n" u"After riding a bus for five hours and arriving in Ithaca at an ungodly hour I was super hungry and Yelp showed me this was the only sit-down option available. \n\nThe interior was warm and bright and just like a traditional mom and pop diner. It was like taking a step back in time and quaint.\n\nThe waitress a college student was remarkably nice and engaged my party in small talk and seemed genuinely interested in learning more about us and our trip.\n\nThe best part was how surprisingly delicious the breakfast was. With only three stars on Yelp I was expecting just to satisfy my hunger but nothing to actually taste any good. The food arrived quickly and far surpassed IHOP Denny's and any other diner I had tried in San Diego California. The food was very flavorful and I especially like the the rye toast with butter - not soggy at all.\n\nAs another reviewer said this is not farm-to-table cuisine. It's conventional food but done right.\n\nIf I go to Ithaca again I will return to State Diner for breakfast.\n" u'Throwback. Old School. Great diner. Went to try Sunset Grill but came across State Diner. Food was good but Toni our waitress was fantastic; maybe the best thing about State Diner. Also they played great tunes. \n\nMust be packed when students are back.\n\nSolid and fun place!\n' u"Don't go here  it was insanely expensive 3 turkey clubs and a kids hot dog with French fries came to 79.00$ ridiculous it was uncomfortable seating and our waitress kept forgetting we were there and to food was only so so waste of money\n" u"This place is so good. It's a diner that literally has 5 pages front and back of choices! Breakfast all day. The omelettes are huge and good come with home fries and 4 pieces of toast. Yum! Side salad is small but good. Chili is good too. If you mix the veggie chili and beef chili it's good! The waitress' are very nice and know a lot about the history of the place. Open from 6am-10pm. If you're a health nut you probably will not enjoy this place but it's truly amazing food for a little diner. This is a must go place.\n" u'As friendly as our waitress was....everything else left a lot to be desired. Very high prices for 2 horrible breakfasts. Disappointing. We will not be coming back.\n' u"This is a fine diner if you are really craving some traditional diner food but this is not the place to go if you are looking for a nice breakfast/brunch. My boyfriend and I came here today for lunch and ordered a cup of their award winning chili to start and then a BLT for me a turkey sandwich for him and a side of fries to share. The chili was pretty good... It wasn't the best chili I had ever had or anything but it was definitely a good cup of chili. It was good that we had that to start though because it took a half hour for our sandwiches to come out after that (which is crazy for a diner). When the food finally came out I was a little disappointed - they REALLY skimped on the bacon on my BLT like there was a piece and a half on each side. It was still a good BLT but darn I wish there was more bacon! The fries were really good but they came straight from the fryer to our plate so they were sitting in a bit of grease. But whateva! The fries were perfectly crispy (possibly the best part of the meal?) My boyfriend liked his turkey sandwich and had no complaints.\n\nUPDATE: we returned and the service was much quicker during lunch. The chicken and rice soup was good but a little too salty. Definitely a fine place to go for traditional diner food and also a good fast cheap option. Will have to return and try breakfast for a more complete review.\n" u'I visited the State Diner with friends during a weekend trip to Cornell. I ordered the French Toast and Chocolate Milk as my drink. The service was fine however when the food came out I was very disappointed with the quality of my french toast. I was expecting challah bread to be used however their version of French Toast was three small pieces of potato bread dipped in French Toast mix. For $7 this was unacceptable and not a quality breakfast. \n\nTo make matters worse when we got the check I was charged $3.50 for the chocolate milk when it clearly said $2.50 on the menu. When I brought this issue up to the waitress she gave me a lame excuse that what I had received was a "large" chocolate milk when I was never given the option of small or large and most definitely didn\'t ask for it.\n\nIn summary this diner is overpriced terrible food and a terrible atmosphere. Stay away!\n' u'We weren\'t sure what to eat tonight (burgers? pizza? evening breakfast?). But it didn\'t leave me frustrated because it gave us the chance to finally try The State Diner.\n\nI\'m not sure how things are when this place is poppin\' but the sodas we ordered shortly after sitting down were almost immediately brought to our table. When I asked about the vegetarian chili option for chili cheese fries I was offered a sample to see whether or not I\'d like it (which I did - especially the bits of sweet potato - but since I always eat like that I thought I\'d "go crazy" with a lacto-ovo plate and toast made of processed white bread.). The food was quick to order and made to our liking; my cheese omelette\'s eggs were dry and my son\'s burger was very well done and topped with fresh veggies. I even spotted two Nutella packets in the basket of jam for my toast. Score.\n\nBut hinting at the service above isn\'t enough. Our waitress Kim was attentive and upbeat. Her co-worker at the cashier served up just enough small talk while I paid our bill. And the cook turned around from his grill just to say "hi". Good people.\n\nThis was our first visit and I\'m not sure when I\'ll be back. But I\'m looking forward to more so I can justify raising my rating from three to four stars.\n\n....Okay I\'m back to make edits and can\'t save this review without clicking the fourth star despite that being my first visit. The food was fresh so it filled us up without forming a brick in our stomachs; and the service rivaled that which you\'d find in a more upscale restaurant. I\'m a fan! :)\n' u'Open for breakfast Easter Sunday most everything else closed. Good food decent service old school diner. Street parking slightly challenging.\n' u'Piece of History renovated to meet todays needs.\nGreat spot best Diner we have ever been to.\nService on point courtesy and professional. \nThanks Stavropoulos Family.\n' u"We come here every time we visit my brother at Cornell and it's always fast and delicious. This time we had the pleasure of sitting at the counter and let me say these grill guys run a tight ship! It was fun watching them work together and seeing how they make the home fries so delicious (the secret is they leave the on the grill in a huge heap forever and it makes them amazing)!\n" u'The omelette I ordered was more like a fried egg on both sides with too many Swiss cheese slices semi melted in between. It was not at all fluffy and light.\n' u'It was a busy day when I came in the servers were running around and I was on my work break. I asked for a BLT and once my BLT arrived I took a bite out of it and there was NO TOMATO. Such a bummer most diners are disappearing around Ithaca. I just wish there were better ones\n']
34.Red & White Cafe,[u'I had the shrimp dinner and the shrimp was fresh and perfectly cooked. The pizza burger was more of a sub sandwich so besides having a little too much bread was tasty. Definitely worth stopping by!\n' u"Very disappointed. I wanted to like this place after seeing the good reviews but it was a big let down.  \n\nService is terrible and staff are unbelievably rude.   How can any place stay in business when the staff treat customers with disregard?   I see there are a few other people who have mentioned the nasty attitude and lack of customer service.... so apparently I'm not the only one.\n" u'HANDS DOWN THE BEST PLACE AROUND FOR FRIED FISH AND SEAFOOD.Down to earth friendly environment. Services is pretty quick expect a little wait lunchtime on Fridays.\nGood prices and a wide variety of food to choose from. My rating on the food is solely on the fish and seafood. I have not tried anything else on the menu. Other people I know have and I only hear good things. I have to discipline myself from not eating lunch there everyday. This is my secret spot you could pass 100 times and not even acknowledge how good this place is. Not to mention they actually fry Haddock unlike that well known establishment in Cortland that fools you with Cod. Give it a try if your disappointed let me know.\n' u"The #1 spot you go for fish. It's always fresh and always good. They have a full menu and unfortunately all over tried is one of their burgers the fish is just too good you pass on!\n" u'Solid fish sandwich tasty homemade tartar sauce friendly owner in a fun neighborhood setting; miles better than the random college town fare a few blocks away on the commons.\n' u"The fried fish here is lighter and more flavorful than Doug's Fish Fry and the french fries are delicious too.\n" u"I almost hate cluing everyone in on what a great little place this is!  You will not find a better fish sandwich/dinner anywhere (I'm looking at you Doug's Fish Fry) and for the most reasonable prices.  Owners are always there as friendly as can be and with recent renovations there are a few tables you can sit at and enjoy your food.  Please note - they're not open late and not open on the weekends - make sure to check the hours before you head over.\n" u"I heard that this is the place to go for delicious fish fry from many locals and decided to check it out.  Well it's excellent.  It's about 4 blocks from the center of town - a nice walk in a pretty neighborhood. I had the fish sandwich w/lettuce and tartar sauce $5.99.  Very fresh tasting with a light batter. There's also Po Boys - oyster shrimp and scallop.  Besides seafood there's a wide selection of other food you would expect to see at a fry place. \nIt's a local favorite and I guess they see no need to post a menu online. Ha! They said I came at a good time because earlier there was a line out the door.\nA sweet mom&pop place with checkerboard table cloths - eat inside outside  \nI saw a take-out menu too.\nClosed weekends. 607-273-5233\n"]
170.Mark‚Äôs Pizzeria,[u"Very friendly made a special pizza half/half for us. Even opened the outdoor seating for us because it was a beautiful sunny day. \nPizza is tasty - thick style. Fresh toppings. I'd order again.\n" u'I had really enjoyed getting fresh whole pizzas from earlier Mark\'s Pizzeria locations so I stopped in for lunch while I was in Ithaca\'s southwest to get my car serviced. At lunchtime I would have hoped the available slices would be fresher but my meat lovers slice once reheated was pretty dry. There weren\'t a lot to choose from either and the $9 "lunch special" for two slices and a soda did NOT feel very special. I had just one slice.\n\nI\'ve heard their new non-pizza items are awful but haven\'t tried them myself. I might consider buying a fresh pizza from these folks especially with a coupon to get the price to a reasonable range but for slice specials I\'ll probably stick to Papa John\'s Sal\'s or Napoli.\n' u"Had a couple cheese slices here with my daughter. Would never order again it's boring conveyor-belt pizza with a doughy middle and an under crisp crust. Cheese was fine. Terrible beverage selection. Cheap.\n" u"Mark's Pizzeria has unique tasting pizza their own franchise taste.  It's something different for someone like me who eats pizza every day.  Refreshing is the word!  I also really like their logo and store name.  Mark's are the superior race after all.\n\nOh wow their Old World Pizza- Thin crust white garlic sauce mozzarella cheese pepperoni sausage onions a special red sauce and a blend of spices. Mmmm.  It's simply the best!\n" u'Excellent pizza. But the service and the manager at simply the nicest and most professional I have worked with in virtually any service industry i have interacted with. Great job!\n' u'Exellent tasting pizza. a little pricey but I would eat here again. and the staff was.very friendly too.\n' u"This review is based only on the delivery.\n\nI got a medium meat lovers pizza for delivery. The site is really easy to use and you can pay by card in advance. They send you notifications by email as they make and deliver your pizza so that you can estimate how much longer it will take to deliver.\n\nWhen the delivery guy came he asked me to sign the receipt but didn't provide a pen so I had to grab one of my own. It's minor but that's the first time I ever had a delivery guy make me get my own pen to sign the receipt so that was a little annoying.\n\nThe pizza itself was pretty good - meat lovers pizza has a decent amount of meat and sauce added lots of flavor. It definitely beats out cheap Collegetown pizza I usually get between classes. The problem is with the size especially since in total I had to pay $21 for this (including delivery charges and a decent tip). Their medium pizza is rather small and cut into six slices which are not enough to spread out over multiple meals like I tend to do. I was only able to make this into 1.5 meals. Unfortunately the cheese didn't taste that great after microwaving so for this particular pizza place I wouldn't try to save slices for multiple meals.\n\nI would still recommend the pizza itself but I'd probably dine in so that the price seems more reasonable for what you get and you won't feel like saving slices for later.\n" u"In town for college orientation hungry for some local pizza. We ordered a garden salad breadsticks and pizza. The salad was very fresh and the pizza and breadsticks were delicious! Online ordering was very easy and delivery was prompt and courteous. Mark's is a must! (Don't forget to use the coupons they offer!!)\n" u"They have a very user-friendly website to order delivery.  And they are always really fast and the food is hot.  Service is excellent overall. \n\nI'll detract one star for the pizza - not very flavorful. They could use some spices. But the menu items overall are quite good for takeout food.\n" u'One of the best pizza places in Ithaca. The pizza crust is pretty sweet which is what I love about a good pizza crust. The sauce is fantastic and the cheese tastes like it is fresh never been frozen which there is a very obvious taste difference there. The pizza has good prices for their sizes too. \n\nWe also ordered the Grandmas Dough which is fried dough with cinnamon and sugar and they were gone at my house in under 5 minutes! \n\nWhat is awesome about marks though is their wings. One of the better wing places with great flavors to pick from. The wings are always meaty and large and have some great flavor going on. The price is a bit up there for wings but honestly most places today are charging more and more for wings. \n\nOverall while I search for the best pizza in Ithaca this place remains my go to when I simply just do not want to try another place.\n' u"I love trying new places when I'm out of town.  I definitely picked the right place here.   I got the lunch special.  Slice of pizza 4 wings and a drink for 7.75. The pizza was great and the wings were cooked perfectly.    I'm very particular about how wings are cooked. Most places are either under or over cooked.      Staff is super friendly!     If I lived here I would definitely be a regular!\n" u'I dropped by for a quick slice on-the-run.  Very friendly staff.  Crust is a bit thicker than classic pizza.  Great sauce not too heavy on the cheese.  Still good even though it was after lunch and the slice I got was from one of those glass warming cases; must be totally delish if you get a whole pie fresh.\n\nNormally I avoid chains but this is tasty stuff.\n' u"I really wanted to like Mark's. \n\nMy wife has long told me about how great the Mark's was when she was younger down in Vestal.\n\nMy experience ... was not good.\n\nThe Pizza.\n\nWhere to start. The sauce tasted like tin and not much else it was not acidic at all and not sweet either. It just tasted kind of like a can as in if I picked up a tin can and licked it. No real tomato taste no salt no sugar ... just an overpowering tin taste.\n\nThe cheese ... there is no way on earth it was real. It tasted like string cheese.\n\nThe crust ... did not taste like anything.\n\nSo I ended up with string cheese on tin.\n\nNot precisely a good \n\nReading the other reviews ... perhaps I came on a bad day or something?\n\nI would be happy to try it again ... if two pies did not cost me $40.\n\nPerhaps I will stop by on lunch and buy a slice sometime and see if I just got them on a bad day?\n\nIf I change my opinion I will update my review.\n" u"They recently opened and so I decided to give them a try. Pizza was good. It had the right amount of thickness though I think mine had a bit too much cheese so I will have to ask for lite cheese next time. And the Old World breadsticks were good too. Their website is easy to use and it had customization options. They deliver pretty far from their location I was surprised since there was another pizza restaurant much closer to me that didn't want to deliver to me. Definitely having them again!\n"]
198.Ling Ling Restaurant,[u"This place deserves 10 stars! Best eggrolls I've ever had!! The food is so good! I always get it delivered. The place is small so it's not the kind of place you sit down at but the food is amazing!! You won't find better!\n" u'If you like tons of water checstnuts instead of vegetables then this is the place. Very disappointed with my pork and the missing mixed vegetables in garlic sauce.\nShould have gone to spicy Asian instead.\n' u'Had Chinese cook and Chinese staff. How bad could it be?\nChow fun noodles terribly over cooked shrimp dish was like soup not much taste in any dishes. \nHow can this place stay in business?\n' u'Tried this place sometime ago. We unfortunately got pieces of raw pork in the fried rice we ordered. We also have heard rumors from people who work nearby that the employees are very ill-treated by whoever owns this restaurant. Not recommended.\n' u'Absolutely THE WORST chinese restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to get food from. The food I purchased tasted burnt and left an unpleasant after taste in my mouth. Avoid at all costs.\n' u'Ling Ling on Elmira Road is my favorite choice for Chinese food in Ithaca.  I have lived here for 35 years and there is no better choice.\n' u"This location is the south Ling Ling that mainly offers take out. The food is just as good as the main location. The counter staff is great. I usually request sweet and sour sauce to go so I can dip my eggroll in it and the lady always gives me a HUGE plastic container filled with their sauce. Their lunch specials are super cheap and their food is pretty good. It's not super authentic Chinese food but it's definitely delicious and a great value. I usually get the chicken and broccoli or sweet and sour chicken. I'm a fan.\n"]
169.Moe‚Äôs Southwest Grill,[u"I wanted to try Moes out because I normally have Chipotle as a go to. I will say that the workers were awesome but the food looked a bit old. You know that look of food that's in those serving trays that has been sitting out for a while... It was that type of appearance.\n\nIt wasn't my favorite some others swear by it.\n" u'Very tasty food but very expensive. When my 12 year old and I stop in for a quick lunch and it costs $25 somethings wrong.\nI got the Earmuffs which is basically a salad and he got the Joey Jr which is a small burrito. Of course the soft drinks are extra but when they charge extra for queso guacamole and even bacon bits that\'s ridiculous. The cashier said it was cheaper if she gave us the "meal deal" but still was costly.\n' u"Food was pedestrian: guacamole was plain queso was fair at best. They do give you a nice big basket of tortilla chips which is nice.\n\nOther than that this place obviously has problems starting on the top: store was pretty messy they were out of tops for their burrito bowls and the person in charge in the store in addition to being much more reactive in letting ingredients run out than proactive was also threatening his employees with physical violence. Openly. In front of everyone. \n\nEven if you are joking: not cool bro. You are not an effective leader at this point and I hope to God you don't have any children yet.  Just FYI: Hate and fear are not positive motivating factors in the workplace.\n\nAnd they are just burritos. Chill the hell out.\n" u'This is one of the only places that I immediately regret eating at- the Moe\'s in Ithaca being a prime example. Kel\'s review below is spot on. \nThey\'re understaffed and under managed as evidenced by; The lack of key ingredients/lack of general freshness of food. Surly brash and unhelpful staff. It was very clear that the employees gave "Zero F\'s" in making my food correctly quickly or at all. Most encounters there leave me with the feeling that I am inconveniencing THEM. \nTheir free time is certainly not spent prettying up the restaurant - I\'ve seen elementary school cafeterias that are cleaner than this place. The chronically dirty eating area messy and wet floors empty condiment area and overflowing garbages are unacceptable \nI hope that the management of this place steps in soon before this place goes any further down the tubes.\n' u"We are regulars at Moe's. Each time we try to ignore the nearly consistent issues: slow service overflowing trashcans dirty tables empty and/or messy condiments area lack of manager presence frequent lack of key ingredients (like tofu or onions/peppers or mushrooms which results in holding up the line while you wait for a fresh batch to be made). \n\nWe ignore these issues because the food is tasty less salty than Chipotle and far fresher than Taco Bell. Also there are several vegetarian options and many of the staff members are usually friendly and helpful! \n\nToday however we couldn't ignore the problems. \n\nOur server was disgruntled rude unhelpful and radiated irritation and contempt for everyone. \n\nWe were made so uncomfortable by their attitude  (which the other customers in line recognized with surprise and discomfort as well) that we left. We couldn't stand to eat anything in that atmosphere. \n\nUnfortunately there was no manager on duty at the time to speak to. \n\nMoe's: It is far better to have slow yet pleasant service than have your employees take out their work-related frustrations on your customers. Your staff often appears overworked under-trained and mismanaged.\n\nUnless drastic changes are made we will not be back.\n" u'Quick and friendly service but the food is below par. The tortilla chips were greasy and salty. The burrito I ordered was alright but lacking flavor. The tables were full of crumbs and oil stains. Absolutely disgusting. I\'d rather head over to the nearby Chipotle for "Mexican" food.\n' u"Went to Moe's Monday. And ordered the burrito.  All portions were small and the servers were not friendly. I had 2 slices of peppers and 3 onions. The rice was a plastic teaspoonful and the meat the same. I have tried several other Moe's and this one be far is subpar. Alos their prices were like a large city.  Will not waste money there again\n" u"I've been a huge Moe's fan all growing up but recently my stomach is in shambles the second I leave. I went here 2 days ago and I still am not feeling great. Steer clear of the ground beef! If you do go here definitely get another meat. The two stars are for the AMAZING queso free chips and awesome drink machine.\n" u"Perfect every time! When we come out to Ithaca we come to Moes and Viva. I've seen people go on and on about chipotle on Facebook sometimes and I can't fit it in my head why. Every time we have gone there the meat is overcooked atmosphere is beat the service is blah and the food is weak at best. I mean really chipotle doesn't hold a candle to Moes at all. Worst of all the meat is not only always overcooked it's also spicy. What is that? I like spicy stuff but I have kids and newsflash my toddlers don't. It's pretty screwed up that they just presume everyone and their whole family want meat that's spicy...one would think they'd give you an option...a pretty odd and narcisstic business model for sure.\n" u'The foodbis good and you can add to the bade what ever you like.\nService is very good and understanding.\n' u'Okay Moe\'s in general is pretty sucktastic because no one wants to walk into a restaurant and be shouted at 2 seconds after entry by every employee. It\'s not their fault because I know they HAVE to but it\'s extremely annoying for everyone involved because they obviously don\'t want to shout WELCOME TO MOE\'S at every customer that walks in because it\'s not genuine. I\'m completely satisfied with a "hello" by the person making my burrito.\n\nSecondly the names of the items are cringeworthy and I will never call a burrito a Joey Bag of Donuts. EVER. I could have a knife held to my balls and I\'d still call it a friggin\' chicken burrito. But that\'s just my personal opinion.\n\nOtherwise the employees are generally good at what they do. One gentleman with a ponytail and glasses (I think?) is always particularly friendly and always smiling. There was one thing that used to work there who was the human equivalent of expired egg nog that had no idea how to treat human beings like human beings (which is funny because usually customers have no regard for fast food employees) but I\'m pretty sure she\'s gone. \n\nI\'m giving five stars because when it comes down to it I always get a product that tastes good and is well-put together. Most of my grievances are with Moe\'s as a corporation and not this specific location. \n\nWELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S WELCOME TO MOE\'S \n\nSTOP IT\n' u'My impression is "poor man\'s Chipotle" except it\'s not any cheaper than Chipotle. The quality and service is just lessened. If you haven\'t ordered yet and you are reading this leave and go to Chipotle. Moe\'s has nothing more to offer except some pseudo-unique decor.\n\nOn ordering we discovered that the people behind the counter don\'t necessarily know the names they assign to menu items. For example the nachos with meat are called "Billy Barou" on the menu. I tried ordering a "Billy Barou" and the guy behind the counter just looked at me like I had lobsters crawling out of my ears. I then said "nachos with steak" and he got it.\n\nThe ingredients are all pretty fresh but nothing special. The salsa bar is very bland--the salsa marked "hot" would barely faze a 5-year-old. \n\nI\'m not all that sure what Moe\'s is trying to be or what niche it\'s trying to fill but it doesn\'t seem to get much of anywhere.\n' u'I would come back to this place again.\n\nIt\'s like a chipotle but there\'s more to it. They have spicy guacamole and you can order side of queso too. Plus they have a subway mixed in toppings you can choose from as well. Basically it\'s a chipotle+pollo loco+subway!!!! So here you have it Moe\'s my bro now! \n\nI ordered a quesadilla "John Coctastan" if anything I think their weird names doesn\'t help my confusion with the menu at first but it got me any type of topping to pick for my quesadilla. \n\nOrder was quick just like chipotle assembly line my quesadilla was huge! I ordered extra cheese with spicy guacamole pico de gallo bell peppers onions fresh jalepenos steak and chipotle ranch. By the time I got it at the cashier it melted in my mouth. It was super good or maybe I was just a pig because I finished it! \n\nBy the way you get a side of chips. They also have five different salsas ranging in flavor and spice on the side bar. They also added those five guy soda machines. So I guess +Five Guys+Rubios bro! \n\nBasically all the southwestern / All American places mixed into one! \n\nHailing from Southern California this place is the bomb for quesadillas!\n' u"We got burritos from here last night because there was a deal on Mondays. Next time ill just pay more and go to Chipotle. \n\nWe ordered online for pickup we got there 15 minutes later because thats when it said it'd be ready. Well apparently fifteen minutes means ypur food will be COLD in 15 minutes. My burrito was lukewarm at best when I got it.\n\nAlso? I really really hate olives are therefore would never order them on my burrito. But lo and behold mine had olives on it. And I asked for the Chipotle ranch to be on the side because im not a huge fan of spicy flavor but I like a little bit...so I specifically asked in the notes section (which printed on the receipt so theres no excuses that they didnt see it) for it to be on the side. It was not. My burrito was spicy had olives and was cold. I ended up throwing most of it away. Blech. \n\nAlso the place was pretty gross when I went in. People were touching food with their bare hands there were scoops being used in multiple meats and just was generally unorganized and dirty. I wouldn't have eaten there anyway. And the chips were chewy and stale. Not what you want from a tortilla chip.\n\nI wll not be returning. I wish I could have just spared myself the five bucks the gross burrito cost me and get something better down the street.\n" u"I'll go back. The food was good and the portions were big enough to easily split at least with the burrito. \n\nI don't know why in the world everyone is exalting Chipotle as fine cuisine. In my experience Moe's was like a better Chipotle. I was really impressed with the free-range / grass-fed aspects meat wise.  My chicken was good. Nice flavor and good amount of food.\n\nThat being said  I need to add here that I am Texan born and raised and new to Ithaca.  If you want a KILLER burrito skip Moe's and Chipotle and go to Mexeo in C-town. That place is in another league.\n" u'First off is Moe\'s Mexican? No Moe\'s is American Southwest.\n\nWhere to start.\n\nThe menu. Moe\'s menu is pretty funny or at least it tries to be. In all reality it tries to set the tone for the rest of the experience which is something many restaurants lack these days.\n\nFood there are a ton of options and I have gone enough that I have tried most of them.\n\nThe Tofu is awesome the pork is okay the steak is okay the chicken and "taco beef" are worth passing on.\n\nThe options are greater than many similar food restaurants. \n\nI have been to this location 20 times easy (my friend at work loves the place so whenever we go out for lunch it is always his go to. I don\'t love it that much but it has never made me balk at going to lunch with him). \n\nIn those 20 times the food has always been consistent and the service has always been good. The restaurant is always clean and the salsa bar is always well stocked.\n\nThe salsa choices seem to rotate every six weeks (new flavors).\n\nTo sum it up Moes is a decent value with decent Southwest American food.\n\nIf you expect Mexican ... there are other options out there.\n' u'Burritos are cheap but not that good. The chicken and pork were dry. Good to fill the belly...not so good to taste. Chips and salsa are good though. Wegmans burritos still win.\n' u"I love moes and I can't complain about a place that has tofu as an option! \nPlus....who can complain about kids eating free tuesday nights plus free face painting?\n" u"I usually go here if i get a coupon of some sorts so it isn't a culinary tour de force at all. But I do enjoy free refills and all that salsa. But the last time we went my boyfriend got a burrito where the rice was very undercooked. Nothing is worse than uncooked rice. I like to get the burrito with the tortilla and the flexibility you get here is nice.\n" u"Our family (including middle school kids) really enjoys Moe's. Considering how far we are from ANY authentic Mexican food I feel this is passable. Much preferred to the Mexithacan food at Viva Taqueria. Relaxed atmosphere - perfect for kids.\n"]
79.Gangnam Station,[u"#39....Enough said!\n \nI've always enjoyed General Tso's Chicken but its nothing compared to this similar yet spicier with better breading.\n" u"The food was really good and the owner was very nice. He came over to our table and explained to us that there was a new chef who didn't use MSGs in the food. He gave us some kimchi jjigae on the house to try and true to his word it was very good and tasted like home cooking. \nI would recommend the kkanpoong shrimp kimchi jjigae and jjamppong the most. The other things on the menu are great as well but those three are my favorite. The kkanppong shrimp is especially crunchy and tasty and I think even those not familiar to Asian food would enjoy it as well.\n" u"The owner/waitress that works here is absolutely the best on service. She's super sweet and nice. This place is good for lunch since their lunch specials save you about $1-5 on certain dishes but I'd consider it a bit expensive for dinner.\n\nJaJangMyun - best dish by far and definitely worth it for the amount they give. The noodles were super chewy and the sauce was extremely tasty and included a fair amount of pork. \n\nBulgogi Lunch Special - not the best of dishes for someone looking for a lot of meat that being said it still tasted rather good. typical bento box style everything was pretty standard. the bulgogi was more of a stir fry with a lot of veggies than a typical kbbq.\n\nBudae Jigae - The soup itself was pretty good definitely better and more spiced than the soondobu soup from koko's. Since the description included ramen I was expecting more of a ramen based noodle soup but it's more soup with a bunch of random meats (include cut up hot dog(?) and vegetables with a splash of ramen). It did include a lot of kimchi though so is definitely good for people looking for a kimchi type soup.\n\nKimchi Fried Ramyun - definitely would not recommend getting this. The ramen was fried to the point of being more soggy and again there wasn't much ramyun but an overload of kimchi. It also just didn't have a good taste overall.\n" u'I had never had the best soft tofu jjigae before I had one in Gang Nam Station! I tried so many different places in NY but nothing can compare to this!\nIt was beyond my expectation.. So yummy :)\n' u'Food was just ok. The amount was so small. We may not recommend this place.\n' u"I got the spicy seafood soup. It was pretty good and really authentic. The portion size was pretty small for the amount of money I was paying though. There was hardly any seafood in the soup. The soup tastes way better than the tofu soup from Koko's.\n\nAnother reason why I have a 3/5 is because the hours are so random! I never know when they're open. I just happened to walk by once when they were open for dinner. I want to come back for lunch and try their lunch menu.\n" u"Cozy Korean/Chinese food in collegetown. My personal favorite is the spicy seafood soup noodle.\n\nThe Korean owner also speaks Chinese. He's been in the area for a while and very friendly.\n\nI recently discovered that they serve soju and beer as well.\n" u"Didn't like the food at all the spicy seafood soup barely had any seafood and cost $15 at lunchtime. I think the other korean restaurants in the area are better/more authentic.\n" u"The Jajangmyeon (on the menu as noodles with brown sauce vegetables and pork) is spot on and comes with a lot of pork compared to other versions I've had. Lunch prices are reasonable. Their banchan selection is above average for Ithaca. I'll be back again.\n" u'So delicious! I love Korean food.  I had fried tofu and vegetables which was hot and yummy. The service was friendly and helpful.  I will definitely eat here again.\n' u"SUPER delicious food and awesome service. It's kimchi hotpot is to die for! You definitely get both quantity and quality for the amount they're charging.^^ It's a small place with attentive servers and a good atmosphere. Definitely coming back next time after a good hike!\n" u"YOOOO this place is horrible. I was completely ripped off. not even going to say anything else about it because it's just a waste of time. I wouldn't go here if I just came out of the desert and the food was free. that's how annoyed I am.\n" u'Not a bad place to get a quick fix for dinner and fairly priced for quality and potions. I recommend the bulgogi brisket BBQ or the black bean noodles. The spicy noodle soup begs for more seafood. Great side dishes quick service and a clean environment. Lunch special prices are fair. Recommended.\n' u"Not too much to say -- the food was ok not great but that's its market. A casual place to eat.\n"]
63.Aladdin‚Äôs Natural Eatery,[u"It's almost 2:00 am and i'm enjoying some baklava cheesecake from Alaadins! We enjoyed everything we ordered lentil soups salads hummas etc. however i found the musakah to be lacking. I'm not sure if it was the lack of beschamel cream or what but it was just ok. We enjoyed the fresh selection and found the falafel to be light (not overly greasy) and airy. Would go back again!\n" u"The food - eh. Despite being cheap especially by my standards which are used to NYC prices I still think Aladdin's is overpriced. The pitas are a decent deal at around $7 a piece but they don't come with any sides and end up being not super filling. Plus even in the city you pay $3-$4 for a better pita from a cart so it's hard to justify getting one at Aladdin's. The pasta dishes run you around $12-14 AND there's an upcharge of around $4 to add meat AND an upcharge for certain types of pasta so you can easily drop close to $20 for a pasta dish. Granted the portions are huge but not enough to justify the price for what is (let's be honest) probably sauce from a jar over boxed pasta. Last time I went my friend and I split the cheese pita appetizer which was literally just cheese melted on a pita for $5.50 and reminded me a lot of food that I've made when I stumble home from the bar at 3 in the morning.\n\nThe drinks - here's one area where Aladdin's excels - the drink menu is relatively large and extremely cheap. Beers will run you $4 or so at the most and those aren't happy hour prices. They have a deal where you can get 2 bottles of wine for $20 during certain times and they have a $14 (albeit terrible) bottle of white sangria on the menu which they serve in cute glasses with fruit. \n\nThe service - oddly terrible every time I go. I'm not sure if I've just had really bad luck but I've had multiple waitresses with nasty attitudes that aren't attentive at all. \n\nTL;DR: definitely missable but I'll probably come back for the sangria or wine deal at some point. Would be 1.5 stars but it's pretty spacious and nice on the inside so I'm rounding up.\n" u"I really liked my Tourlou pasta! I'm not vegetarian but I loved the eggplant tomato black bean mix that was on the pasta. It was delicious as was the spinach fettuccine pasta (you get to choose what type of pasta you want) which was cooked nice and al dente. It was super filling as well. It came with a really tasty garlic bread...I wish I could've had more of that! The main problem with this place was the service. We weren't even given water we just grabbed the pitcher and served ourselves water throughout the night. And it took forever for our waitress to notice we were there even though there were 7 or 8 of us...\n" u'Absolutely delicious! \n\nThis was my first time really having Greek food and it was fantastic! The prices are more than reasonable and the selection is great. \n\nTo start we had the tourlou and the spanakopita. Both were amazing! The spanakopita was soooo good. It was cheesy flakey and oh so good! \n\nFor dinner I had the vegetarian lasagna called "mellansagna(?)" and it was delicious! It was pasta filled with several vegetables and cheese topped with marinara sauce. It was served with a choice of salad and some pitas. It was very good!\n\nAnd for dessert we all shared the baklava. It was my first time having it and I loved it! Very light and flakey with a sweet taste. \n\nThe atmosphere and outside seating were fantastic and the service was great. Please check this place out!\n' u"It's good but not amazing. I usually get a pasta dish here but they often go a bit overboard with the toppings.\n\nThe best time to go to Aladdin's is during their 2 for $20 special which I believe is only on weeknights (I could be wrong). You get an appetizer and two entr\xe9es for $20 which is an awesome deal especially for the large portion sizes that you get.\n\nIf you're splitting the bill with a group of people make sure to keep your receipt and check your credit card statement later. A new waiter accidentally charged me  6/7 of the table's bill and while it was rectified later it was a pain to get the money back from everyone else.\n" u"Great atmosphere! First of all I have to say get the pesto linguini amazing! \nThe service is very friendly and very helpful with questions regarding some of the food I wasn't familiar with. I have been recommending people to eat hear who have never been. I went with my girlfriend because it was near my work. But now it's one of my favorite restaurants. The only thing negative I could say is the interior decorating looks a little outdated. But your usually so distracted by good the food tastes you won't really notice the 80s decor.\n\nEnjoy!\n" u"Although I've lived in Ithaca for eight years now I only recently visited Aladdin's for the first time primarily because they accept Ithacash. It has now become my favorite restaurant in Collegetown.\n\nFavorites on the menu include the sauteed spinach the dolmades and the grilled chicken strips which have always been juicy and flavorful. For my entree I generally order the chicken or beef souvlaki the chicklaki or one of the salads.\n\nI have also been consistently impressed with the desserts my favorite being the baklava cheesecake.\n\nAdditionally I have found the service to be consistently friendly and I enjoy the atmosphere particularly their shady patio which is lovely when the weather is nice.\n" u"OK so I graduated from Cornell almost 20 years ago and I still come back to Aladdin's when I'm visiting. Good to mediocre customer service but even better moussaka. Clean good ambience reasonable collegetown pricing and excellent solid food. Overall love this place as a non-chain restaurant option for Ithaca!\n" u'This place is great for who is looking real and healthy food. It is my favorite restaurant in Colletown. Price is reasonable and food is delicious.\n' u"Aladdin's is a totally fine meal but it's just that - fine. The pastas aren't cooked al dente but not cooked too much that they are mush. The sauces are good but not great. I had cavatappi with sundried tomato pesto which is one of my favorites on the menu but the pesto is more oily than it should be so most of the sauce sinks to the bottom of the bowl and you're left with some grated Parmesan and sundried tomato pieces. But the flavors are good and comforting so it remains my favorite option. My friend had the lentil soup which she loved and promptly finished. Aladdins is a good place for an easy meal or take out but is not a culinary experience.\n" u'Great "homey" ma-pa feel.  The Lenchili was to. die. for!!!!! Highly recommend. Everything is really fresh and pretty reasonable priced :-)\n' u"A crushed fly in my salad!!  They replaced my chicken caesar salad with a few pieces of leaves.  Like it would cost them a leg to give me a new full salad or one with chicken in it.  I definitely left with a bad taste in my mouth knowing that I ate salad pieces on top of that dead fly.  On subsequent visits I saw flies flying around the kitchen too.  I'd be careful eating here in the Summer.\n" u'The food was healthy. We got the gyro plate and a pasta dish. I also lost my debit card there and they kept it for me until I went back and got it! Yay Aladdin.\n' u'Well the food was not bad (mediocre). I thought the portion was a little too small for the price. \n\nThe interesting thing was that by the end of our dinner we were vehemently scolded by our waitress for being "rude customers". There were 8 of us and we were there to celebrate our friend\'s birthday. We had some intimate and friendly conversations and we didn\'t ask her to do anything outrageous during the entire dinner. Apparently she overheard parts of our conversation on restaurant experiences at other places and tipping in general. She thought that we were not going to tip her well so she took offense and decided to confront us about it. She told us that we don\'t deserve to eat at a restaurant like Aladdin\'s if we don\'t tip well (in fact as a party we actually had to each tip her 18%. We didn\'t think that was bad tip...). \n\nShe also complained about giving us individual bills since for some reason it was extremely challenging to do at Aladdin\'s. By the end she emphasized that she goes to Cornell yet the majority of waiters and waitresses don\'t go to college and she had to teach us a lesson on behalf of the rest of the poorly educated waiting community.\n\nWe couldn\'t believe that we got a waitress like that and we had no idea why she thought that it was acceptable to just come and scold us the way she did. We had a really bad time near the end. The management certainly didn\'t take our complaint seriously. They were apparently busy with things more important than customer experience. I don\'t think any of us is ever going back there. It\'s simply not worth it.\n\nOverall I wouldn\'t recommend Aladdin\'s if you value your night out and don\'t want to risk getting scolded by your waitress!\n' u"Aladdin's food is usually very good but the portion sizes are horribly small for the amount of money you pay ESP if you order take out. Don't get the special pasta especially if its ravioli because it's a rip off for the amount you get!!\n" u'Love their pastas ... Get the sundried tomato pesto with any of the linguini \n\nAlso the falafel salad and creamy vegetable soup are pretty good. Ask for the hot sauce with your falafel salad\n' u"I've been here twice. Ordered gyros on both occasions lamb and shishkebab. Both were OK. Nothing really spectacular about them. I could have easily made them at home. Portions are very small. Was still hungry after my meal on each visit.\n" u"On a vist to the  Cornell campus we walked the streets at 9pm looking for some dinner and came upon Aladdin's. The reviews didn't seem stellar but I am a sucker for Mediterranean food. We were pleasantly surprised. We all shared Raviolis Gyros and Lasagna. Great service and a reasonable bill will bring us back next time in Ithaca.\n" u"This is probably one of the better places in Collegetown but the bar isn't set that high to begin with. They have a pretty big menu and some items can be customized like the pasta. I tried the basil pesto with garlic pepper linguini and grilled chicken and thought it was pretty good.\n\nThe problem with this place is the price though. A relatively small plate of pasta should not cost $13. Also the chicken that came with it was really small. The quality of the food doesn't justify paying that much.\n\nIt looks like a nice place to have small group dinners though. In the warmer seasons you can sit outdoors on a nice patio.\n" u'As a lover of Greek salads and chicken the chicken souvlaki is my favorite. Dessert here is pretty "meh" though.\n']
160.Domino‚Äôs Pizza,[u"Let's just say I eat a lot of dominos.... This place is great. It's clean the workers are nice service is prompt orders are correct and the pizza is always made to perfection.\n" u"I ate here A LOT back in 2012-2013 and I had a great impression of this Domino's- food and customer service.\n" u"STUPID M. FUCKER !! BURN IN HELL !!! \n\n\nI CALLED AT 7:00 and placed a order 2 hours later I called to see where my food was at and they said I have to wait another hour ? I told the manger I wanted my money back and he said he Credit back but they never did. And hung up... After calling back I ask for his name and store number to report them and he goes : oh my name namd store number is ..... & fucking hung up on me again fucking stupid losers ! can't find a actual job so they have to work at a pizza shop !!! \n\n\nPLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND EFFORT HERE !!! & I WILL BE REPORTING THESE SCUM !!!!\n" u'good nothing wrong with that.\nI ordered delivery for chicken wings and pizza and they dropped to me on time with average great food great taste. But that was in year 2014 in March and October 2014 though. Lately I ordered papa john too.\n' u"Have only had good easy food ordering experiences with these guys. Food is always nice and hot when it's delivered and everyone I've talked to here has been nice.\n\nedit: Been a year of ordering from here and they're still always perfect. They never mess up my orders or bring them in late. I don't get the other reviews.\n" u'Pizza delivered at 2am? Doesn\'t get much better than that.\n\nThe Grub --\n* 2 Medium 2-Topping Pizzas (Mushroom & Pepperoni and Pineapple & Bacon) ($5.99 each)\n\nVenue Review --\nDomino\'s is tucked away into the corner of a small plaza right before you reach the Commons where the REAL food is. It\'s nothing special in terms of dining arrangement. Everything feels a little sticky or greasy but that\'s exactly what you\'d expect at any self-respecting pizza parlor.\n\nFood Review --\nThe price cannot be beat! For $5.99 apiece my friend and I ordered in 2 Medium (12") pizzas to fuel our weary minds. They were SO HOT when we opened up the cardboard boxes that steam came rushing out. It was as if they came right off the pizza belt. The garlic crust is a BIG plus. It might have just been the fact that we were going delusional from all the studying but my friend and I were very impressed with the pizza. Only problem we had was that the sauce was barely there and the cheese (we asked for the normal amount although there are heavier options) was also almost nonexistent.\n\nService Review --\nThe times I\'ve dined-in service has been "eh". Just enough politeness to get your order in and sit down with your food but of course when you get fountain drinks refills are on your own buddy.\n\nOverall Impression --\nIf you get hungry on a Friday or Saturday late night call up Domino\'s they\'ll deliver until 2 AM! Most other nights they\'re open until 1am. Domino\'s isn\'t always my first choice back at home (it falls short of Mountain Mike\'s Papa John\'s etc.) but with many more great deals like this one maybe I\'ll be calling them up more often.\n' u"Worst service I've ever experienced.  Period.\n\nPlaced an online order via the app at 5:07pm on a SUNDAY night.  Called 90 minutes later when my pizza still hadn't arrived to the hotel I was staying at.  When the employee I spoke with learned of my situation she NEVER ONCE APOLOGIZED and said that both they and the driver tried calling to get my hotel room number which was an absolute lie as I had no missed calls and I was sitting in the lobby waiting for him to arrive.  The ignorance willingness to lie and attempt to pin the problem on ME is the polar opposite of customer service.  I strongly recommend that this store instill a little effort into appropriate customer service training skills as it is quite evident that none of its employees have any f***'s to give.\n\nPromised to refund my credit card.  We'll see if that ever happens.\n" u'Love love love dominos. Extremely affordable and in a town where it is usually a 45-60 minute wait they are always here within half an hour.\n' u'Great experience with delivery highly recommend you do it online though as the hold up for on the phone can be quit long on busy nights like Friday or Saturday\n' u'BEWARE. The worst. I have ordered from them multiple times and they always happen to "forget" part of my order - whether it\'s a drink a side etc. Of course I feel bad telling the poor driver to go back just to pick it up when it\'s not his fault but when this happens MULTIPLE times it makes me wonder if they\'re truly just constantly making mistakes or trying to rip off customers by taking a couple of dollars from each.\n' u"In my experiences Domino's usually has good service but not this one. In three and a half years of ordering from them the majority of my orders have resulted in a bad experience. They've refused to honor coupons that are still valid they've delivered the wrong pizza and they've taken forever to deliver.\n\nMy worst experience was on a football Sunday. They quoted me 1.5 hours until delivery and I thought that was a long time but I was willing to wait. 2 hours later I called back to check up on where the pizza was and they told me it was next in line to be made. I called again at 3 hours and they didn't even pick up the phone. After repeated calls I called with a friend's phone to see if they were screening my calls and it turns out they picked up right away in hopes of taking another order. Once they found out who I was they put me on hold and I couldn't reach them after that. The pizza was never delivered.\n" u'I feel ridiculous for trying to write a review for Domino\'s but my experience with this place has been frustrating. I\'ve never ordered takeout in Ithaca but I called this place to order a medium two topping pie for delivery. \n\nI was stuck on the phone for ten minutes during this transaction. The man on the other line just couldn\'t figure out what I was saying even though there wasn\'t much background noise on either end. At one point he said to me "Shouting will not help me hear you better" which I found irritating because I wasn\'t actually shouting. It was a bad connection but thanks Domino\'s for placing the blame on me.\n\nWhen I gave him my credit card number he said the machine was frozen and it was rejecting my order. When I asked to make sure that all of these failed attempts weren\'t charging my credit card repeatedly he said "It\'s telling me \'failed attempt\' so how can it be charging your credit card?" \n\nSo I said I would like to cancel the order altogether. Of course he called me back five minutes later to say that the order actually did go through and my credit card was charged. To cancel the order now he added I\'d have to wait three days for the charge to clear from my credit card statement. \n\nApparently "failed attempt" could very well mean that the order did go through so I guess he belittled me for no reason after all.\n' u"The service at this Domino's is by far the worst I have ever experienced.  I've had several occasions where they have given me the wrong order and recently they placed my delivery order in the store pickup pile after they initially told me I had a 45 minute wait.  After my order hadn't arrived by 50 minutes and I found out their mistake they told me it would be over an hour to deliver on too of the 50 minutes I already waited.  Truly the worst pizza place Ithaca.\n"]
85.Okenshields,[u'I often choose Oakensheilds over a lunch/dinner in Collegetown because it is a buffet and has quite a balance of stuff to eat. But as a college dining hall I would be pretty disappointed with it sometimes if I had to eat it on a meal plan. But the food is really hygienic and healthy.\n' u'Okenshield has the magic power to cook all the things the same flavor !\n' u"The best restaurant  with 150 yrs' history. Good way to go in Ithaca.\n" u"Definitely worst dining hall in Cornell but it's convenient and safe to eat. I personally walk down to west campus for extra 5 minutes to eat better food.\n"]
151.Firehouse Subs,[u"I love Shortstop but this is better. I usually get the smokehouse brisket and cheddar (IMHO the best sandwich there). It is so damn tasty I become sad after I've finished eating it. Nice atmosphere never crowded food comes out quick clean etc. but to me it's their smokehouse brisket that keeps me from having subs elsewhere. Ik this is just a chain and Ithaca has lots of great restaurants but this has got to be one of my favorites\n" u'Pretty decent subs. They have a variety with calories explicitly listed on them which is good. Also have a nice selection of hot sauces. Good for a quick grab.\n' u'Waited one full hour for two subs. Unapologetic uninformed unable servers. Do not come here under any circumstances.\n' u'Great subs but when three subs cost over $30 I shall dine elsewhere.\nEach sub came with the obligatory chips and drink but still.\n' u"This place isnt quite as bad as others have said. I would give it a 3 - It's okay.\nThe sandwiches taste pretty good it will definitely fill you up but you'll most likely spend more than $10. \n\nThey have a good selection and the atmosphere is nice. I thought the huge selection of sauces was cool too.\nThe service was just fine.\n\nEverything is clean. Not the best sandwich in town but they have some different items than most sub places.\n" u"The flavors and quality if meat is superior to Subway. The bread texture and taste is superior to Subway. It isn't as good as Quiznos was but they went out of business locally due to poor location. I have been here 6+ times. Always quick service and polite. The turkey cranberry is not good combo as cranberry too sweet for a sub. \nI like the reward of free drink for completing their surveys. The other subs are juicy and tasty. I like the 25+ self serve sauces/hot sauces and the fancy customizable soda machine that even tells how many calories per serving of your choice.  I don't like the corporate making them shout out a greeting (why I hate Moe's) but luckily they don't do it all the time here and not as loud and jarring as Moe's.\n" u"Favorite lunch spot in Ithaca. Subs are warm staff friendly they do reward programs discounts and the theme is nice. It's a fireman-oriented environment with various different pieces of gear and what-have-you adorning the walls. I've tried every sandwich they have and I always revert back to the Engineer but there's nothing disappointing on the menu. They also have a gigantic assortment of hot sauces along the counter to spice your sandwich or salad. The owner is friendly and very community oriented. He is constantly in the dining area walking around checking satisfaction and making small talk with various patrons. Check it out and grab a hot sub for lunch.\n" u'Delicious Food & Fast Service - if there is a problem with your order -- they will make it right. Love taking my kids here & the staff is friendly as well.\n' u'So I went back again the other day and the experience was sub-par.\n\nUpon walking in the line just mumbled the "welcome to firehouse" which hey I don\'t care so much but still.\n\nWe went up to the line to order and I got the New York Steamer and my wife the meatball again. We just got medium subs and together the meal came to about $20. They brought our meal to our table which was nice.\n\nThe New York steamer was not impressive at all. There was not a lot of meat and cheese and the flavor tasted like something from Arby\'s. It was also pretty same. Maybe the large would\'ve been better but that would\'ve made the sub almost $8 by itself. The price really hit me. This place is just not worth the price.\n\nBetween Gorgers Shortstop Deli and Wegmans this place just isn\'t competition in my opinion.\n\nThe only reason this get\'s 2 stars is because my wife loves the meatballs there.\n\nAll in all opening night was great for this place but it has already gone downhill. That and they should have never gotten rid of that pork sandwich. \n\nAlso during our meal someone spilled their soda by the front door and I heard the staff saying they didn\'t want to take the mop out so instead of picking up the spill they just put a wet floor sign out. Thought this was hilarious and sad at the same time.\n\nSo save your money and go to Yogurtland next door or Five Guys across the street or Wegmans right down the way if you really want a sub worth $8.\n' u"I just tried Firehouse Subs for the second time.  It wasn't terrible.  The food was tasty and the staff was nice.\n\nThere were two glaring weaknesses.\n\nThe first is that the service was slow.  It took forever to get two sandwiches despite the fact that there was no line at the counter when we came in.\n\nBut the bigger weakness was the value.  A small sub chips and a drink was over $8.  You get much more for your money at Subway Jimmy Johns or even the local supermarket.\n" u"Food is good. Restaurant is clean. Workers are angry at you for coming in 20 minutes before closing even though you're in and out within 5 minutes.\n" u"I was down at PetSmart and was craving a sub so I checked this place out. I ordered the brisket & cheese sandwich and all I can really taste is BBQ sauce.\n\nPositives: The atmosphere was nice and everything was clean. The staff was also very friendly and helpful.\n\nNegatives: The food. I'm tempted to say you're better off going to Arby's as others have but the quality is *slightly* better. That being said I wish I had just gone to Subway instead.\n" u'I love this company but this location was brutal. Being the only ones in the store a sub should not take half an hour to make. Try also messed up the order and after waiting that long we just took the food and left.\n' u'Not sure why these people say they prefer subway? My wife and i have ate here numerous times  and have always had a great meal and service! If you like no meat and tons of lettuce then go to subway but i like meat on my subs and have never been disappointed yet.\n' u"My boyfriend and I discovered this place completely by accident and it has become our favorite new sandwich spot. It's truly a hidden gem. We've collectively tried five different subs so far and all of them have been absolutely DELICIOUS. Better than Wegman's better than Ithaca Bakery MILES better than Subway. \n\nAlso I'm confused by the reviews saying the service wasn't good-- The staff has been nothing but friendly and helpful. They go out of their way to make recommendations make your food exactly how you want it and come to your table to ask how you're enjoying your meal. \n\nThis might be my new favorite lunch spot. A+.\n" u'This was mine and my father\'s first experience at a Firehouse Subs. Overall it was a great experience. The owner Anthony was very friendly and attentive. He took the time to go over the menu with us and made sure we understood all of the options. The food came out in a timely fashion and was delivered to our table. I ordered the meatball sub which was pretty good (my grandfather makes stellar homemade meatballs so it\'s hard for me to rate any other meatballs as "very good") and my father ordered the hook and ladder sub which he said was phenomenal. The pricing is along the same lines as a Subway or a Quiznos and so are the sizes. The difference is the quantity of meat Firehouse subs have a lot more meat on them than Subway or Quiznos subs do. Plus they\'re toasted in an actual toaster unlike Subway subs. All in all it was a great experience and I would recommend Firehouse Subs to my friends and family.\n' u'I had a fit of nostalgia and stopped by when I saw firehouse had opened in Ithaca (I am from FL originally).\n\nThe food quality was good the value was horrible. So the food tasted good but the price for what you get is astronomical. Essentially a 6 inch sub with a small drink cost me 8.50. Compared to Ithaca Bakery ... not worth it.\n\nI was not greeted when I walked in the store. (the owner was not there at the time) When he walked in suddenly they started greeting people again. \n\nI asked for "fully involved" i got just meat and bread. When I took it back it took 15 minutes to get the issue resolved ... 15 minutes ... \n\nI did the online survey and the owner called me. Seemed like a nice guy in his message ... but sorry bud ... the prices are not worth it and the crew is horrible.\n\nThey also do not offer different sizes of sandwiches like at other Firehouse Subs.\n\nAll in all it was horrible.\n\n**Edit**\n\nThey apperently do offer two sizes of subs like other Firehouse Subs ... I was just told they did not when I tried to order a large sub.\n\nWhich actually makes my review worse ... I would give it zero stars if I could.\n\nCrappy service with uninterested unknowledgable staff and food that is blatently overpriced.\n' u"A great experience. Staff was friendly and easy-going service was prompt and the meat ball sub was one of the best I've had in recent memory. My only wish is that they had a location in Brooklyn.\n"]
28.Tibetan Momo Bar,[u"Seriously best dumplings in Ithaca. I get the pork momo (Tibetan dumplings) once a week. Comes with 8 pieces a little cabbage/carrot side salad. Try the orange-colored sauce on the counter on all of it--it's great. A full meal worth of dumplings for $7.56.\n\nI've had their sushi and their hapayaki chicken (very spicy) and both were good--but seriously get the dumplings!\n\nLastly that older review says they have a card fee but not anymore!\n\nAlso Tibetan Momo is at the Farmer's Market on some Sundays and have these ridiculously good fried coconut cream cheese things which are also very very good.\n" u"Best dumplings in Ithaca! I had the chicken momos (dumplings) and they were delicious! Each one had a thick noodle wrapper that was soft and chewy that surrounded a meaty chicken and vegetable center. The momos were super fresh and filling costing only $7 including tax and also came with a finely shredded cabbage and carrot salad.\n\nI also tried the chicken lo mein which was prepared quickly on their flat top grill. The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a flavorful seasoning while the vegetables were equally tasty. None of the food was greasy oily or overly salty so even though I left full (with leftovers) I wasn't weighed down like you typically feel after eating fried Chinese food.\n\nBottom Line: this is a great lunch spot to grab delicious healthy and fast Asian food that will leave you full energized and happy\n" u'This little restaurant is actually in a food court in Center Ithaca so look around until you see the sign for Tibetan Momo Bar.\n\nThe guy running the place makes a nice variety of Tibetan and Japanese food but you definitely need to try the momo which are Tibetan dumplings which he can make with a variety of meats or with veggies only. There are some sauces to try with them and you get a nice side of fresh cabbage and carrots. The vegetable rolls and California rolls are also very good.\n\nI recommend bringing cash as they will charge you a fee for using a card and they need to run it to one of the other nearby vendors to process it.\n']
147.Concord‚Äôs Maine Squeeze,[u'Super delicious juices made right in front of you from fresh produce! Very friendly. They also had tasty-sounding soups. \n\nLocated just inside the Center Ithaca Mall on the Commons. Will definitely be back!\n']
53.Madeline‚Äôs Restaurant,[u"We have been meaning to go to Madeline's for Sunday brunch for several months and today was the day.   We're sorry we waited so long.  The meal was excellent from start to finish.\n\nThe menu is an eclectic mix of primarily pan-Asian Dim Sum dishes and a variety of breakfast and lunch large plates.   With some difficulty we selected several Dim Sum items (Steamed Shrimp Dumplings Fried Pork Dumplings General Tso's Bao Bun Lamb Sausage with Tzatziki and a large plate (Miso Shitake Ramen).   While intrigued with the design-your-own mimosas we were still in need of caffeine and had delicious cups of coffee.\n\nThe traditional dumplings were as good as any we've had in New York City or San Francisco.  They were fresh and the portions generous.  The sauce had just the right amount of spice.   In a playful blend of tradition and adventure the bun was a delightful pillow filled with General Tso's chicken again with a pleasant amount of heat.  The lamb sausage was one of my favorites of the morning.  It was a reinterpretation of a traditional sausage sub.  Wedges of grilled pita accompanied a wonderful lamb sausage slivers of pepper and onion and a tasty tzatziki.   The star of the day though was the ramen consisting of a delicious miso broth filled with noodles mushrooms carrots kale egg slices and apple kimchi.   Our only criticism was that we would have liked to have seen the egg cooked in the broth or a lightly poached egg instead of hard boiled.\n\nOf course one can't go to Madeline's without having one of the desserts for which the restaurant is known.   The biggest challenge was choosing one since there are so many and every one is amazing.   With a bit of help from the waiter we settled on the blueberry frangipane.   I wish I could have one of these every morning.   The buttery crust perfectly offset the almond and blueberry filling.   And speaking of filling we certainly were and we were glad for every bite.\n\nThe varied menu means that there is something for everyone whether one wants Dim Sum Eggs Benedict or Chicken and Waffles.  There were many untasted dishes which simply means that we need to go back soon.\n" u"I really really really want to like this place but I just simply can't. The food is fantastic it's just that the service is absolutely horrible. We got to our dinner reservation for 4 at 5:30pm on a Saturday night and didn't get our food until 6:50pm when 3/4 people had ordered appetizers as their main course. First confronting the waitress we heard her continuously blame it on the kitchen staff and their miscommunications and next confronting the manager who blamed it on the inexperienced waitress we finally got our food and ended up leaving very disappointed. We were very thankful that they offered desserts and gift card compensation for our time but this being the second time that the service was ridiculously slow I don't see myself there in the future.\n" u'Great little place on the end of the commons . Food was fantastic . Service super fast and drinks were amazing . Ordered the Fuji salad Cambodian beef skewers  Brussels sprouts and spring rolls. Best food for a date night and very well priced. Will be back again.\n' u"Amazing mix of Asian flavors at the top of the commons plus spectacular desserts.  My daughter ordered about four starters so we got to sample a bunch of them and they were all delicious beef skewers lamb sausage pork dumplings tuna poke and a couple of others. The can't miss though is the chocolate creme br\xfbl\xe9e. Whatever you are doing leave some room.\n" u'The fusion dishes are not only innovative but hit the spot in a completely refreshing way. The atmosphere is also warm elegant and a mix between modern and nostalgic-- great for a romantic date night or even a night out with old friends. I think one of the best dessert places in Ithaca; and every appetizer I tried was mouth-watering and delicious. The trick is to mass order appetizers and split-flat! Who would think queso bulgogi and tater tots would go together?\n' u"We were in Ithaca a few weeks ago and asked around where is a good place to get dessert.  A couple of  people said to check out Madeline's. So we tried but they were closed for renovations.  So we knew we had to come back so we did!\n\nThe place\n\nIt is located in the commons area which if you have never been is a cool area full local shops and restaurants.  It is a beautiful downtown area to visit.  Madeline's as I said was just renovated and comes across as a swanky hipster place yet not snobbish.  They have really nice booths and tables with big plush chairs it really looks nice and of course is very clean.\n\nThe staff\nMy advice as soon as you are seated walk up to the counter and look at the window full of desserts.  I love when I can see something before I order it.  The lady working was very friendly at answering all our groups questions since I never even heard of half the names of the desserts!\n\nThe food\nThis is a dessert only review since we didn't eat here.  One advantage of being married is when I go to places like this I can try to coax my wife to order something I want to try. Sadly it didn't work this time!  Because when they have so many great looking options you can't just try one however ordering two desserts I might have went into cardiac arrest in my booth!  I ended up ordering the  Zuccotto. Which is a thin sponge cake layered with hazelnut chocolate cream and a mocha chocolate cream center. I can only say wow!!! So glad I went with the staff recommendation.  Being full from dinner this cake was not only amazing but very light! It might have saved me a trip to the ER to get my stomach pumped.  My wife ordered the Coconut cake which was decent but in my opinion nothing special opinion.  The rest in my group seemed to love their orders also.  We all ordered some coffee too which I can say was pretty good.  Better than average that is one thing I hate when I go to a restaurant and get crappy coffee so I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n\nThe verdict\nI really love this place the ambiance the desert and the staff.  From what I can see on Yelp and facebook the owner is truly invest in this place and listening to the customers. This is a not the norm sadly so I am looking forward to trying the food and obviously more desserts! Hopefully next time I can to a better job of coaxing my wife to order something I want too! :)\n" u"A bit pricey and upscale (not a bad thing) great atmosphere.  Love the bar great scotch selection.  We had eaten across the street and deiceded to grab some drinks and dessert here.  They have a large display of desserts and they do not disappoint! I plan to have full on dinner her next time I'm in Ithaca.  I had the tiramisu and my sons had the chocolate creme brulee.  Waiter and bartender were very attentive!\n" u'Very tasty food.  The service was great.  Love the atmosphere is very comfortable.  Been a few times abd enjoy it.\n' u"Wife and I have dined darn near everywhere in the world. The Chilean sea bass is arguably the best dish we have ever had...truth. Hard to believe our favorite dish is found in little ole' Ithaca. Another restaurant on the commons serves a similar Chilean sea bass...very good...but a far cry from Madeline's cuisine genius.\n" u"The decor is beautiful! There's very romantic lighting in the restaurant and there are love couches perfect for people going on a fancy date. \n\nNow onto the food. I got the soup dumplings and I was not impressed with the price or the quality of the dumplings. The skin tasted like it hadn't been steamed long enough and the meat wasn't very fragrant. \n\nI do really like the desserts at madeline's. I'm always pleasantly surprised at how good their desserts are but again the price would make any college student wince. I've gotten their creme br\xfbl\xe9e tiramisu banana cream pie and chocolate tarts. All really good!\n" u'This place is great if you need a cocktail.  The bartenders are all well versed and polite.  However the food always leaves something to be desired.  Last time I was there I had the duck buns and they were just ok.  Come for before or after dinner drinks but leave the food to another restaurant.\n' u"Horrible food: no season/favor. Customer service? What service? Ginger ale wasn't even good. A rat ran until my chair while seated outside the staff said nothing nor did they ask if I or anyone in my party was ok. It was completely disguising!\n" u"Thanks for hosting jazz on Tuesday nights! We'll be back.\n" u'Fantastic place loved it.  \n\nTop notch service polite professional there when you want them and gone when you dont.  Decor and atmosphere are really nice. \n\nI can only speak to the desserts but the selection and quality were very good.  Also enjoyed a really nice cocktail along with the dessert.\n' u"I had a drink and a salad with 3 friends. The wine was delicious and generously sized. The salad was fresh and the dressing tasty though on the small side (lunch plate/appetizer sized). On the downside I asked for no meat or cheese on it and there were no substitutions offered (like nuts or tofu) yet the price was not adjusted so in the end I paid $9 for small salad of greens onions and three cherry tomatoes. Ouch! I didn't thoroughly check the menu but based on the appetizers specials the server told us about and my salad experience I'd say this isn't the *most* vegetarian friendly place. \n\nOur server was attentive and the outdoor seating area was lovely on a cool night. They do a decent job of shielding folks from the unsightly construction surrounding the restaurant. The drink menu is extensive. My friends said their appetizers and drinks were good.\n\nI'll be back to try the desserts - they look amazing!\n" u'Food was expensive but not quality. Value was not there.  Had two calamari it was ok little dry.  Two Kobe burgers no salt and none on table.  One dried up beef skewer.  Chicken dish with risotto was mediocre.  The mussel appetizer the mussels were so small it was shells and broth. Disappointing. And expensive\n' u'This was my favorite restaurant in Ithaca. They recently went through a major renovation of the menu and the restaurant itself. The decor is improved but it was always good. The menu was very good before but probably did need some updating. Unfortunately they went from very good food that was nicely presented to a bad imitation of a mediocre pub. The food was loaded haphazardly on the plate and was so loaded with salt it is hard to even recognize any other flavor. There were a few vegetarian options on the menu that might have been better but they were not available. \n\nThe good news is that the deserts have not changed and the bar is as nice as always. One note however is that the wine menu was dramatically cut and skewed to mostly uninteresting selections (with the exception of a few good local wines).\n' u"Family celebrations? Business meetings? Romantic dinner for two? Just feel like eating out in a nice atmosphere? \n\nMadeline's is the place to go! A multileveled dimly lit restaurant with elegant interior design that meets small town Ithaca homeliness with a fine dining experience Madeine's is a place for anyone to enjoy. The wine and liquor selections will satisfy anyone's picky habits and theim restaurant's initiative to sell only fair trade organic gluten free foods makes for some of the best ingredients. Not only that each plate is carefully designed and prepared to perfection! The staff is also very courteous friendly and helpful so any concerns or requests you mat have will be promptly addressed. \n\nI dined here to celebrate my brother's graduation from Cornell and I ordered the Grilled Salmon they offered on the menu. It came with a garlic cream that when eaten together made my taste buds go BALLISTIC like flubber. It was served with a side of delicious fried rice and sweet potatoes both cooked to perfection. \n\nMy only criticism of the place are the desserts. While my coconut cake was absolutely delicious the cheesecake key lime pie and several other desserts tastes almost exactly like each other meaning that ordering different dessets made for a less adventurous and less exciting experience. But they were delicious nevertheless! \n\nFriendly staff great atmosphere delicious food: the whole package. A full Dinner may be over $50 per person but it's all worth it at Madeline's.\n" u"This is by far one of the best restaurants in Ithaca! With a recent menu change Madeline's has truly showed that it is always up to inspire new cuisine. Both the Dim Sum brunch and new lunch menu are worth every penny! Make sure to save room for dessert as they are some of the best in the county!\n" u"DO NOT COME HERE DURING ANY TIME IT IS BUSY. \n\n I am not the type to complain about service. My tips are usually invariant to service I'd rather happily refill my own water than wait I hardly ever send food back.\n\nAnd yet I feel compelled to write my second review ever and complain about exactly that. I was at Madeline's yesterday on Friday night. They are a nice place to go when no one else is there but on Friday understaffed and the staff they do have are forgetful and rude.\n\nMy waitress forgot my initial drink order. 20 minutes later I reminded her I had a drink order while people in my party ordered theirs. She brought them their drinks and then with a straight face asked me if I wanted anything. I politely ignored the fact she had amnesia about my drink order and placed it again and as far as I could tell my two prior inquiries had never happened. I then waited another 5 minutes to get my drink. But I sat next to the tap so it baffles me why.\n\nFine. But then my waitress did not take our order after an hour until I politely complained to another waitress. Also if you're going to have this understaffing problem put some friggin' bread on the table or you're gonna get hangry folk. \n\nAs dinner progressed I wanted more drinks. More coffee. More food. More desert. I'm not asking you for 'stupid' things like more water refills. \n\nBut if I had waved traffic signals to get my waitress' attention it would not have worked.  She ignored my raised hand on over 5 separate occasions tending to tables next to us. She made eye contact with me once as she passed by and then looped in a circle around the restaurant so as to avoid me. \n\nHey all I want to do is buy more stuff from you to which your tip is proportional. \n\nI raised my hand at another waiter and he gave me an ugly face and walked away. My actual waitress did not come by within 10 minutes suggesting rather than help me he wanted to give me my comeuppance for smilingly raising my hand for help.\n\nAnother waiter was about to do the same until I made an audible sigh under my breath and enervated shrug both to signal my defeat. He flagged down our waitress.\n\nTo be honest I really wished I had severely reduced the tip. But I was just so frustrated I didn't even want to wait.\n\nYou're not the only game in town!\n"]

201.Sandella‚Äôs Flat Bread Cafe,[]
111.Kelly‚Äôs Dock-Side Cafe,[u"Kelly's has absolutely delicious omelets and home fries.  I get a different one every time I come and it's never disappointing.  During the warmer months sitting on the patio and listening to the inlet is relaxing.  The latio is also isolated from other businesses nesrby.  Service is great and they've always been very polite.  Highly recommend!\n\nFor the college students (and others) in the area this is amazing hangover food.\n" u'Was really good.  Had a fresh mozzarella tomato basil caprese salad that was wonderful. She had a toasted bagel with some good stuff on it as well. As a light lunch it worked.\n' u'Good service decent food. The waitress looked young but was attentive and nice. The mimosas hit the spot. I ordered a ham and cheese omelette with hash browns and wheat toast. No complaints with my meal. I would return if I was driving through.\n' u"Amazingly bad; I cannot fathom where reviews higher than two stars came from. The food is terrible the dishes are not clean and the service is poor.\n\nI went to Kelly's today for breakfast with my boyfriend. The restaurant was not yet busy and we were excited to check out the patio which has been raved about here. First we ordered coffees and my mug was caked in crusted food; it looked like oatmeal. The waitress brought me a new mug and we ordered standards off the menu: a Western omelette and over-easy eggs with sausage. In my omelette the onions were nearly raw and the peppers tasted dirty like they hadn't been washed. My boyfriend's eggs were severely undercooked and the waitress charged him extra for toast which she hadn't mentioned wasn't included with the eggs. \n\nI ended up sending my omelette back because I couldn't eat around the dirty peppers and raw onions and the waitress said she would adjust the bill accordingly which she didn't-- we were charged in full. We also never had our water refilled during our meal even though it was a hot day and half the time there was a dirty server's tray on our table that she had neglected to move.\n" u"This is a definite place to eat for an evening on the patio. I don't think our experience would have been as great if we had to eat inside but the dockside patio is charming. Our waiter was extremely attentive and knowledgeable.  He under quoted our bottle of wine price but on his own accord let us know he would honor the price initially stated. Crab legs were great. My kids ate better than they have at a restaurant in a long time.\n\nI noticed previous comments about the bar bathroom (which I agree needs some work): FYI there are much nicer MENS AND WOMENS restrooms upstairs :)\n" u'The food was good drinks were great and the view / weather was amazing! We especially enjoyed our waiter Steve who was very attentive and patient with our crazy group! He was so helpful by recommending yummy dishes and bringing everything in a timely manner!\n' u"HORRIBLE RESTAURANT. Rude Owner. Made us pay for meal when they had not informed us that all you could eat meant you had to eat all the crab legs including the knuckle. which is fine if you like that but I do not. I asked the waitress to ask the owner how much to pay for our meal since we didn't touch it and he replied to her all of it. This is when I became furious because I could tell that he just didn't care about anything but money and not pleasing his customers. They did not inform us til our meal arrived and that those were the terms and then acted like that was the policy for every all you can eat crab legs establishment. Highly recommend if you enjoy walking out of a place like you had just been bent over and railed like Jodi Foster. I am an educated and intelligent person believe me this isn't some irrational idiot who never dines out. I know when I've been scumbagged and this is the definition of.... FUCK THIS PLACE...... \n\n\nPS I know scumbagged isn't a word. \n\n\nKisses...\n" u'The owners were exceptionally nice to us. We came in after closing and they still served us amazing food and treated us kindly. A home style restaurant with nice people! I highly recommend.\n' u"Service is below par. Two different meals had hair in them please have your cooks wear hats.  Meals don't come with home fries so make sure you order them.\n" u"Sometimes the best places are a little rough around the edges. Do not let the exterior (or the interior) scare you away. There is no better place to have a beer and some thoroughly fried food on a weeknight. Enjoy some colorful characters rustic ambiance and the sublest hint of nature. Kelly's is concurrently a diamond in the rough and the rough itself.\n" u'I really love this place for breakfast and lunch outside on the back deck not sure why it has such a low rating! It is right on the canal and is so beautiful and serene. One of my favorite spots to just have a coffee and bring a book. The food was not outstanding but it was totally tasty and fine and I would recommend this place to anyone passing through Ithaca who wants a scenic breakfast.\n' u"My husband & friends & I wanted to go for Sunday breakfast someplace new (to us) and decided to try Kelly's.  We've driven by dozens of times over the years but never stopped to dine before.\n\nIt was a gorgeous late-summer morning and were excited to have the opportunity to get to sit out on the deck.  The hostess walked away though before directing to exactly which table to sit at and were stood there confused and not sure where to sit.\n\nAfter we were finally seated our drink orders were taken.  The server returned quickly with our beverages BUT she spilled the entire glass of OJ all over the table and us.  And our cup of coffee was only half-way full and had many coffee grounds floating in it.  The OJ was replaced but the rest of the meal we sat in a sticky wet mess and had a bee hovering around us our entire meal.\n\nThe food was OK but nothing special.  Our over-easy egg was completely hard-boiled and the hollandaise sauce was not good.\n\nAt the end of our meal the server managed to drop more items; my knife fell on my foot when she grabbed the plate.\nWhen the bill came we wer hoping to see that the OJ would at least be comped but no suck luck.  The bill had not been adjusted for the spill (which completely soaked my friend's outfit and shoes).\n\nAgain not impressed and certainly won't be hurrying to go back.\n" u'Really sweet people! ?Go here & grab eggs anytime.\n\nOnly thing I would say is the place needs an energy uplift maybe some redecorating/updating.\n' u"Good for breakfast. Absolutely the worst for drinks. Stopped on a Friday for a couple of beers-what a mistake! $4 beer!  While we didn't expect the Ritz we expected the prices to reflect that. Lousy service(at the not-too-busy bar I might add).\n" u"Just came back from Sunday brunch here and felt compelled enough by the meal's poor quality to leave a 1 star review. The food was seriously seriously bad. Seriously - it's terrible. I had french toast with the texture of a wet newspaper and my partner had crabmeat eggs Benedict that was possibly the nastiest thing I've ever seen.\n\nNice people nice atmosphere but profoundly terrible food.\n" u"Lunch here was half decent.  Service was good but there's nothing special or bad that stands out about the food.\n" u"Terrible restaurant. Two German shepherd dogs in the restaurant wandering around - one even sat under me in the booth. Table top felt like it hadn't been washed in weeks. The food was marginal at best. I feel sorry for the staff.\n" u'I recently stopped here for a burger around lunch time and the place was almost deserted.  The hamburger patty was obviously frozen/pre-fabricated the pickles were low-quality and the appetizer tasted like it was heated from frozen.  It was clear that they used the cheapest ingredients possible in order to cut cost but the quality suffered as a result.\n\nA shame really because the deck is a peaceful setting with a lot of potential.\n' u'I happened to stumble upon this cafe while my friend and I were on our way to Treman Park. Upon arriving we were greeted by a very friendly server who told us to choose a seat out on the deck. We decided to sit by the water and watch all the kayak rentals go by. That was entertaining.  \n\nOur server was friendly and quick. I ordered the fried fish sandwhich and my friend ordered the scallops.  My  fish was crispy and fresh not at all greasy. The scallops were really good.  We were pretty impressed. As we were leaving at least 2 people wished us well and to have a good day.  It was a great start to our day at the park!\n']
29.Coal Yard Cafe,[u'This place is great. Great food that is made quick. Great coffee and other drinks. And all at an affordable price.\n' u"Such a great hidden place! They accept credit card. There was no wait for Sunday brunch. Their prices are cheap. Only downside really is that it's tiny and there's not a ton of seating area especially outside. Also no alcohol = no boozy brunch here.\n\nOrder food at counter and coffee is self-serve (they serve Gimme Coffee which is heavenly). Breakfast was SO cheap and quite delicious! Service was so helpful and quick. The decor is adorable and cozy. I am in love with this place for brunch in Ithaca.\n" u'This place is a joke. I don\'t think I\'ve been to a more poorly mismanaged "establishment" in a very long time... A friend and I went in on a Tuesday at 10:30am - on the same ticket we ordered two breakfast meals one coffee drink and one beverage from the cooler. It was  busy with maybe half the tables occupied. \n\nAfter ringing us up the woman behind the counter said she\'d grab my beverage from the cooler and the coffee drink would be right up. My friend grabbed us a table. I stood by the cash register and waited for my canned drink and the woman proceeded to ignore me and help other customers in line. Slightly frustrated and unable to catch her attention I walked and joined my friend thinking she would bring the drinks out together. A few minutes later she walks to the table with the coffee. I had to follow her up the counter and make eye contact to finally get my drink. \n\nShortly after my friends food arrived but not mine. No problem maybe mine took longer to cook. My friend finishes her food -- mine has yet to arrive. I go up to inquire about my order and was told "it\'ll be right up" by a girl I didn\'t recognize. I stand and wait for 5 minutes then walk back to my seat and see the tables that have gotten there after me are almost finished eating. By this time I\'m highly frustrated. After watching another table get their brunch I walk back to the counter and realize they have forgotten to make my meal for the second time. Wow. \n\nIt took about 5 minutes after they realized their screw up on top of their screw up and rushed the order over as most tables were full and leaving. Needless to say I\'ll never go back.\n' u"Creative and diverse menu. The breakfast sandwiches are excellent. Try the felafel with egg. It's delicious.\n" u'My new favorite place for a nice quiet Saturday breakfast and coffee. Big fan of the sweet potato hash and the falafel and egg.\n' u"Mmmm...the rice bowl might be the best breakfast I've had in a long time (and it also might be the first time I've ever had rice for breakfast).  The food is fantastic and the cafe has a cozy ambiance.  This is our new favorite place to take out-of-town guests.\n" u"Undoubtedly one of the best spots in Ithaca!\n\nBreakfast here is whatever you want it to be. Highly recommend the homemade donuts and the bacon egg & cheese on croissant.\n\nIf you're going later in the day (but not too late because they'll run out!) Friday's special is a plate of perfection: golden brown fish filet on crisp French bread and luringly savory french fries. \n\nAdd in Coal Yard's cozy ambiance and friendly staff and you have yourself a real treat of a cafe.\n" u"My new favorite coffee shop in Ithaca. I work at Cornell so Coal Yard's location makes it very convenient for me to swing by for a morning treat. I was introduced to this place via a colleague when we were on the way back from a meeting and seeking some post-lunch caffeine. The space is very cozy with a unique decor. I just moved from Buffalo so the Buffalo scale they have on display by the fireplace really caught my attention.\n\nOn to the food. The pastries are a delight - their blueberry muffin is amazing. I have had their Ethiopian coffee and Sumatra blends which are both very nice. My understanding is their get their coffee beans locally but check me on that fact. Otherwise I have noticed they have great lunch specials and overall a fairly substantial menu given their kitchen space. I have yet to try their lunch means but when I stop by during lunch hours it always smells wonderful here. I would definitely recommend this little spot tucked away.\n" u'Such a hidden gem. A wonderful  clean and delicious place for lunch. Highly recommended. Check out their fb for daily specials!\n' u"I love it here it's right across from where I work and has great food at very reasonable prices. It's the kind of place that memorizes your order! Have been going for years.\n" u'Unfortunately I have to amend my review due to some recent business decisions the Coal Yard Cafe has made. When you order a sandwich you can typically choose from two kinds of bread one of which is a French peasant bread that is quite excellent. I\'ve ordered many sandwiches here on that bread.\n\nOn a recent visit the cashier informed me that they were "reducing the portion size" of sandwiches served on that bread since it\'s bigger than the other breads. Turns out that means they are now giving you half a sandwich instead of a whole sandwich. I have a big problem with being given half a sandwich (which is smaller than a piece of Wonder bread) when I order a full sandwich especially when the price has not gone down either. I find it to be incredibly disingenuous if not a plain rip-off.\n\nI will also note that I am not in the habit of leaving poor reviews without first trying to resolve the issue with the business. I have tried twice to contact them once by email and once by messaging them on Facebook and they have not responded to either despite the fact that someone obviously updates their Facebook page daily. I guess customers must be in abundance at Coal Yard Cafe if they can ignore concerns but this customer won\'t be going back.\n' u'Fantastic little coffee shop!!!!. Breakfast was delicious. We only wish they were open later. Such a friendly warm place. They really make you feel welcome with their tasty comfort food and the warm ambiance.\n' u"Been here a few times.  But the food is very inconsistent.   Sometimes it's great home fries are always good. But sometimes the tuna inside the tuna melt is cold sometimes it's burnt other times it's perfect. Got the crepes a few days ago togo. Got home and the crepes were still gooey and raw in the middle and the mixed berry compote tasted for lack of a better word carbonated and fermented like it had gone bad. In the past the crepes have been fine but this time is was like do they even check their products to make sure they are still good?\n" u'This is a great little spot that has high quality food for reasonable prices. Can get a made-to-order omelette made in minutes with French Bistro quality. Specials change every day. Everything I have had here has been high quality and they know how to make French fries to proper way. \n\nThe only thing I would change to is a better ventilation system to carry away cooked oil in the air.\n' u'Best omelet in ithaca.  Great coffee.  Fresh donuts and cinnamon roles.  Friendly quick service.  They serve lunch but breakfast is so good that I always go for the omelets.  Very good fried potatoes.  All ingredients are fresh and properly prepared.  A generally undiscovered gem.\n' u"Excellent food and service. On a Saturday morning we had a rice bowl (avocado bbq pork like a bi bim bap) matzo ball soup (seasonal) and waffle with strawberries. We couldn't decide which one tasted the best cuz they all were. Including their mocha flavored coffee. :) make sure you come visit!!\n" u"What a surprising little treat! I had no idea this place even existed until browsing Yelp this morning. Cute small space with lots of light. Well designed and inviting atmosphere. Terrific food. I had the falafel special and it was the best falafel I've had in my life (and I've eaten many a great falafel in DC)! Parking is scant seating isn't very plentiful and the scenery isn't much but other than that this place is a gem. Highly recommended.\n" u"Great breakfast burrito and earl grey wake up breakfast tea. The price is a little pricey though but it's the closest place to graduate housing on the east side. Would definitely come back in the future!\n" u'My favorite spot for meeting a friend for coffee and tea. Croissants are delish! I especially love the cozy wood stove in the winter- makes going out in the cold tolerable.\n' u'Great place! Friendly staff varied menu and good food at reasonable prices. Would definitely recommend for a casual breakfast or lunch.\n']
137.Mac‚Äôs Cafe,[u'Ate here just about everyday during college Serve Biscuits for Bfast & Pizza Pasta Sushi & Deli Sandwiches for lunch...They also have a meal of the week which sometimes was Indian (as an Indian I hated! the Indian option). \n\nNever minded eating here except on days when they served Indian. The pasta was always really good. Would switch up the Penne for tortellini sometimes Mix the marinara with Alfredo throw in a little red peppers.. got your self a quick lunch. \n\nGet the large when you get Pasta because you can usually not finish it which makes it a good afternoon snack. For the size & amount of food you get its def cheaper.\n' u"This is the only eatery on campus that is unfriendly to students. You can't even use big red bucks after 3 pm. Why should a student's meal plan money be good before 3 but bad after 3? Could you imagine if a business ran based on the philosophy of no credit cards after 3pm but yay to credit cards before 3pm? It's highly annoying. The pasta is decent and so are the enchiladas but nothing is particularly good. Since the food here is no better than Cornell Dining eateries I'd rather support the Cornell dining establishments because they are actually student friendly.\n\nI also suspect that unlike Cornell dining these employees are not being paid a livable wage. Cornell dining employees are so friendly. These employees are not.\n" u'I miss this place! I ate their tortellini (half marinara half alfredo sauce) almost every day during college. They have the best breakfast sandwiches and cookies.\n' u"This is your typical cafeteria style campus food joint but I gotta say it's not too shabby.  The variety is great - sandwiches salads soups pizza weekly specialty dishes overpriced sushi coffee bottled drinks etc.  I usually get a sandwich with double meat and it's stacked so damn high I have to take it apart.  God I love meat.  Oh yeah their meatballs are hella tasty.\n\nThere's not enough seating unfortunately.  Nothing is worse than having a hunger attack holding on to a tray of double meat and/or meatballs on the side and not having a feasting table.  \n\nPrices are reasonable given the convenient central campus location.  Service is friendly too.\n"]
112.Press Cafe,[u"I like the idea of Press Cafe but the execution can be improved.\n\nFirst off if you want quality espresso made consistently this is one of your best bets in Ithaca. Your latte mocha etc is going to be good. I find the brew coffee to be quality as well although I think their choice of the Copper Horse Steady Hand decaf is a mistake. It's all roast and no bean.\n\nThe atmosphere of Press Bay Alley is enjoyable and I like the minimalist vibe of the cafe itself but the seating is not at all conducive to staying and enjoying the place. Very small tables and about half of the chairs are a folding style while the other half are plastic. The last time we were in there almost every single one of the plastic chairs in the cafe was broken meaning sharp potentially pinching shards under your @$$. (This would seem to communicate something about how much they care about their customers' experience.)\n\nDue to this uncomfortable seating and the tiny tables I would rule this out as a place to work.\n\nA few complaints here on Yelp about the service so let's address that: If you want a knowledgeable barista that knows their coffee I don't think you can go wrong here. And some of the staff is friendly. The other half of the staff however have that disaffected manner wherein they will not make eye contact or manage a smile when you come in to spend your money. When that is going on in any establishment you can probably be sure that management/ownership is not putting an emphasis on customer service.\n" u'Great cup of coffee. Perfect actually.  One of the best cups of coffee that I have ever had. I had the Colombian. \nHorribly unfriendly and snobby female barrista. I almost walked out...hence the 4 stars.\n' u'Disappointed. Both the execution of espresso and the attitude of the barista... in general the shop really is just so so...\n' u'On a day trip to Ithaca a few weeks ago I spent too much of my time in search of a quality coffeehouse to hang out in. Unfortunately I did not find one but Press is as close as I got to my ideal coffee experience. Ambience is very hipster but in the most uncomfortably elitist way. Press has the potential to be a cute minimalist coffeeshop; however the dead silence and underwhelming service contributed to the "trying-too-hard" vibe I got upon arrival.\n\nCoffee was decent. I got a seasonal latte and took sips of my boyfriend\'s red-eye neither of which were particularly exciting. We arrived in the early afternoon in search of a caffeinated pick-me-up so we didn\'t try the pastries but they looked standard.\n\nOverall not a particularly thrilling cup of coffee but Press Cafe is definitely your best shot (ha get it...espresso shot?) at a solid caffeine boost in downtown Ithaca.\n' u"The coffee was good but the staff let it down a lot. I felt like I was a huge inconvenience for no good reason. Super peculiar experience. It was a busy day but there were no other customers in line. I just felt bad after the visit like I'd annoyed someone.\n" u"Press Cafe is the best coffee shop I've been to in Ithaca- and maybe anywhere. The shop itself is minimalist and beautiful. The staff are helpful and friendly. The espresso is top-notch. The staff (listening to them talk shop) obviously know their stuff. And... and...\n\nOkay. Confession time.\n\nI've always dreamt of having a coffee shop of my own. I've been to several shops that made outstanding coffee. But *my* shop was going to be different because it would carry carefully-curated accessories. It would have a very small selection but you'd know if you got something (a grinder a scale a press a kettle) that it was the best there was.\n\nWell Press beat me to it. I don't have a shop but I do my homework on accessories. Take a look at what they have and do hours of research on each item and you won't find anything better. These folks have created a mathematically perfect coffee experience. You'll be happy you checked it out.\n" u"The best coffee I've had in Ithaca! \n\nI've been hearing I should try this shop but it's a bit off the commons (in Diagon Alley er I mean Press Bay Alley) so I hadn't had the chance... until today. Can't believe I waited so long! What was I thinking settling for mediocre espresso elsewhere?!\n\nCappuccino was truly a cappuccino not a latte (imagine that!) Foam was perfection! The coffee was excellent. Smooth aromatic no hint of burn.  Price is high but for the quality it's absolutely worth it. \n\nThe shop itself is rather stark but not altogether unpleasant. High ceilings white walls metal tables/chairs black & white photos. I could see it being a good place for writing or studying. A cozy couch might be a nice addition! \n\nThe barista was friendly and talented. No complaints on the customer service front.\n\nI will go out of my way to come here in the future for sure!\n\nNote to PBC: You have a narrow bar that runs the perimeter of your shop. Would be perfect for people/car watching... Yet you have no bar stools. Please update!\n" u"--- Updated to 3 stars since the chair situation has only deteriorated since I wrote this review several months ago. \n\nPress Cafe is especially great in the summer when the garage doors are open and breeze comes in! Both the cold brew and the drip coffee are good. The wifi is also strong for those looking to get some work done. Contrary to one of the reviews here I've always had pleasant interactions with staff.\n\nMy 4-star rating stems from the fact that Press Cafe's plastic and metal chairs are very uncomfortable. I would come much more often but the seating doesn't lend itself to staying more than 45 mins. Also there are few outlets so make sure you charge your laptop in advance. With a few cushions on the chairs and more stable tables this place would easily get a five-star review in my book.\n" u'Hot cocoa tasted awful bad customer service  and boring atmosphere. High prices to match.\n' u"I'm pretty obsessed with & addicted to coffee to the point where I took a trip for my birthday last year to Seattle to try out as many coffee houses there as I could fit in 5 days! That said this is easily in the top 3 coffee joints I've ever tried. I discovered this place on my way home from Ithaca about a month ago simply because I was in need of my daily caffeine fix before a 5 hour drive and I'm happy I did. My dad got a mocha I had a latte with (I think) soy milk. He said that his was perfect not overpoweringly chocolatey or sweet so that it still tasted like coffee and not hot chocolate like most places do. Mine was also perfect it was definitely one of the smoothest lattes I've had which is something important to me in an espresso drink. The espresso had that nice almost earthy flavor that gave it some interesting texture which contrasted the milk nicely. Overall this place only competes with my two favorites which are in Seattle and Italy.\n" u"Espresso is amazing staff is so kind environment is clean and comfortable the 2 shot almond milk iced latte was the best latte I've ever had. Don't sleep on this coffee opportunity.\n" u"Beautiful new shop! I usually get a cold brew but everything I've tried has been good. Pastries are better than any I've had elsewhere. My favorite is the oatmeal cookie. Plenty of outdoor seating. Catercorner from the public library and great spot for people watching!\n" u"The four-star rating is strictly for the drink I ordered. I'll be back as Press Cafe's cappuccino is easily the best I can remember having--strong and smooth with little to no aftertaste. The shop itself is a tiny affair and one of a handful of small businesses that took up in the Ithaca Journal's old press bay. I would've liked to get a pastry as well but they were overpriced (even relative to Gimme! Coffee) and looked like they had spent a good while in the case. I'm sure Press Cafe has got a good crew but the particular barista who served me was kind of checked out. He rang me up after preparing my drink not before so I was standing there cash in hand for a few minutes until he was done. Then he went out to take a smoke break leaving just a few customers inside and no one behind the counter. Like I said at the end of the day I'm in it for the coffee but I think there's room for improvement on the baked goods and service fronts.\n"]
172.All About Chicken,[u"Ithaca has a strange lack of fried chicken.  No KFC Popeye's Church's nothing.  You only real options when that deep fried hankering comes calling is Wegman's (oddly mediocre considering their other offerings) Tops (but then you have to go into Tops) and All About Chicken.\n\nAnd let me say it's terrible.  All About Chicken is the marketing name for Sammy's fried chicken outlet.  They seem to change their name every year or so to throw people off but don't be fooled.  It's the most mutantly small chicken (honestly they look like toy chickens) coated with a soggy ridiculously salty mush that they call breading.  No crunch or even taste for that matter beyond a sheen of salt.  Gross.\n" u"Worst service ever! Almost 2 hours for delivery midday. Teenage driver didn't even apologize just shoved the food towards me and left. Never ordering from them again and recommend you stay away as well.\n" u"Horrible delivery service! \nThe delivery guy didn't even know my address location and was getting angry at me because I couldn't find him. The guy was at a 4 houses down my house on west campus. When I met him he was just rude.\nThe food was okay. But it was definitely not worth the trouble of getting my food. \nI had fried chicken combo. The chicken was slight brown and the outer layer was hard. Corn was bland and mash potatoes were not great. KFC is better.\n"]
4.Maxie‚Äôs Supper Club & Oyster Bar,[u"THE place to go in Ithaca for seafood. Their oysters are fresh daily and super cheap during happy hour! (4-6pm weekdays) \nPlus $10 bottles of wine every monday! Combine the two and it's a classy romantic and affordable date destination. \nAlso their complementary cornbread and honey butter is delicious ;)\n" u"It was really great food. I read the reviewed before hand so I knew what to expect but it was pleasantly delicious. The flavors weren't out of this world but it was definitely delicious and hearty.\n\nDon't miss out on the 1/2 price oysters. Definitely worth it!\n" u'WHAT A BUMMER. I try not to go into restaurants with high expectations because then I feel as though I\'m not being completely unbiased. BUT so many locals recommended this place to me I had not doubts that I would be disappointing. But sadly I was. After wavering between and fish and risotto special and the standard fish fry on their menu I chose the fish fry (because you can\'t go wrong with a Friday Fish Fry right?). It also included cole slaw and mashed potatoes. \n\n1. The fish while plentiful in quantity was of poor quality. It was beer battered but had zero flavor. It just seemed like they dipped it in flour and called it a day. After two bites I instantly regretted getting it and wished I had gone with the special. \n\n2. The mashed potatoes also very plentiful also somewhat flavorless. I\'m not sure if it was the type of potato they used or how long my food had been sitting before it was served but the potatoes were just not right. They tasted really chunky and starchy. \n\n3. The coleslaw. NOPE. Just nope. There\'s nothing worse than when people to to "fancy-fy" an american classic. All you need to make coleslaw great is mayo salt sugar pepper cabbage and carrots. It\'s all about ratio and proportion. Don\'t add anything extra don\'t detract a staple ingredient. I took a few bites of it and left it sitting on my plate. \n\nOverall I would return back to Maxies (so long as I don\'t have to pay). The portion size was great but the food was so blah. I do want to try another menu item just to see if the fish fry was poorly done or if all of their food is bland and flavorless.\n' u"I really wanted to like this place more than I did after reading all the great reviews but sadly I was disappointed. I came here over Ithaca's graduation weekend with a party of 6. They don't normally take reservations but being such a busy weekend they took us for a 7:15 with a $15 deposit per person for the reservation. We arrived on time and were seated promptly. \n\nWe started with a bottle of wine for the table while I ordered one of their many cocktails. One of the weakest cocktails I have ever had and finished the watered down drink before appetizers came out. My girlfriend and I decided to do the half dozen oyster sampler (all from P.E.I.) for $19.95. I'm sorry but what on the price? That's crazy STUPID pricey even compared to NYC. Oysters were priced at $3.25 a piece here! For a seafood/raw bar you would think they would understand how to price oysters. They were small nothing special oysters. \n\nI tried another one of their cocktails a martini style after being disappointed on the first try. This time the weak cocktail was served in a mini martini glass. This place can not get cocktails right at all! \n\nMy family seemed to enjoy their plates; some jambalaya and pulled pork platters but were not blown away. We had a late lunch so Victoria and I decided to split a crab cake po'boy. We received a half a sandwich of stale bread a little lettuce a slice or two of tomato and ONE crab cake. Yes only one crab cake with about 12 waffle fries for $15! We had to drown it in BBQ sauce because the sauce was the best thing on the table. I don't understand if this was an off night for the place seeing the reviews but I wouldn't come back based on the prices for the portions.\n" u"First time here tonight and it was delicious. Started with Cajun popcorn which is quick fried crawfish with Remoulade. Oh that was good!!! The iced tea was a Black Currant variety very tasty! I had the Jambalaya and oh it was spicy but very tasty. I must say this was the best protein to rice ratio of any Jambalaya I've had. Lots of shrimp and Andouille sausage with some chicken in there too. Wife had the crab & corn chowder. She said it was very yummy. And she was very happy with the crab to corn ratio. Very heavy on the crab light on the corn and it even had tomatoes.\n" u"My wife and daughter love this place but I don't like it at all. I had a bad experience the first time I was there with the meal being inedible. They did manage to drag me back one more time after a year or so and it was a different meal but a repeat disaster. SO ... I hate it they love it and I've averaged that out to a 3 rather than write a one-star review of my own. \n\nI do NOT recommend it.\n" u'Was in the Cornell area for a day and a couple of friends recommended this place. My friend and I wanted to grab some food at 2 for a late lunch but was disappointed to find out that this place opened at 4. We wanted to eat cajun food so badly that we decided to kill some time so we could try out this restaurant. We arrived at 4:30 and realized that only the bar was open at 4 with limited food options and that the full menu opened at 5. We had waited so long already we might as well wait more. We used the time to look at the menu (specials are on the chalkboard in the back!) as we ordered some cocktails for ourselves. \n\nFinally it is 5 and we ordered the jambalaya "me-oh-my-a" and the jumbo gumbo. The dishes were big and very filling. The jambalaya was very spicy so beware but it was so good I just couldn\'t stop eating it. I would say though that the rice felt really wet and there may have been too much sauce in it (perhaps from the tomatoes). The jumbo gumbo really is jumbo and was a thick stew that provided for a really hearty meal. It also had a lot of flavor in it. \n\nThis place is worth a try if you\'re in the neighborhood since there\'s not a lot of cajun places in the area. Plus they give you free cornbread at the beginning of the meal! So soft and moist! And it comes with really good butter! Also my friend and I went on a Tuesday and there was a live band playing so that was a really nice treat!\n' u"Yes!!! I've been craving cajun food for forever and was so happy I found a cajun place near us. \n\nI ordered a shrimp po boy for myself a grilled cheese sandwich with apple slices for my Lil one and my husband had the fried chicken with mash potatoes and spinach and oysters on the side to start with. \n\nWe got there 20min to five and was told there was a limited menu until 5pm. That was fine. We ordered and the food came pretty fast after that. My shrimp po boy was good. The shrimp was tasty and the pickles were so good. Can't forget the waffle fries on the side with their cajun mayo...OMG!!! AMAZING and life changing as I like to say. Do they bottle that stuff? I should've asked. \n\nMy husband enjoyed his meal as well. The fried chicken was a chicken breast but it was really tasty. The mash was great and the gravy was amazing. I need that recipe ASAP. The grill cheese was good too. \n\nThe price for the entire meal was pretty good. The food and service was great. Only issue was parking which is to the side. We had to create our own parking space because everything was full.\n" u"If you're looking for Cajun food this isn't the place. Adding hot sauce doesn't qualify as Cajun! I ordered the shrimp and grits and was disappointed to get instant grits and shrimp drowning in a tomato sauce that was flavorless other than being hot. I ordered it with andouille sausage which I'm pretty sure was just Italian sausage. Drinks were overpriced and watered down.\n" u"Fun and energetic Cajun restaurant with a nice patio and good happy hour - half price oysters! However the rest of the menu was underwhelming.\n\nWe came just before the happy hour ended and shared a dozen oysters. At half price it came out to be about $20 pretty pricy as other Yelpers have commented. We also shared a salad to get some veggies in us.\n\nWe ordered the jambalaya and the crab cakes. I really enjoyed the crab cakes but found the jambalaya to be extremely salty. We had a hard time finishing it. The slaw also comes with a lot of cheese - we were overwhelmed by the strong flavor and couldn't finish that either.\n\nI'd suggest this as a fun happy hour place for drinks and oysters. If you stay for dinner hopefully you'll have better luck with the entrees.\n" u"Last year my wife and I went to Maxie's and we had a pretty good time with some good eats. This last time wasn't quite as great. In terms of location and atmosphere Maxie's is great. Not too far from The Commons and easy to get to. It was walking distance for us so parking wasn't an issue. The music and atmosphere is very festive and if you go at off hours you get seated right away. Our server was also very friendly and provided great service.\n\nUnfortunately our food just wasn't that great. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cheddar on top. The taste was pretty bitter and did not taste like most pulled pork I've had. My wife ordered the shrimp and grits. They were good just not great. The taste was good but seemed to be missing a spice or two which threw off the meal. I will say that the cornbread was good. If you like your cornbread on the sweeter side which I do you'll like it at Maxie's. Now granted I'm not a huge oyster fan which is their specialty so I'm assuming they do a good job with it. \n\nOverall a pretty good experience just not amazing taste-wise. Maybe we'll try some different dishes on our next trip!\n" u"We came in for dinner on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy (graduation weekend). We had reservations for a party of 6. Now they don't normally accept reservations but they made and exception for this weekend since it was going to be busy. They charge a $15 deposit per person for the reservation so make sure everyone can definitely go!\n\nOur server came over to us quickly after we sat down and took out drink orders. The drinks took a while since the bar was packed and the battenders were running around like crazy. My boyfriend got a cocktail but said it was weak so I just stuck to wine. For an appetizer I split the oyster sampler with him. We were shocked by the price. Almost $20 for 6 oysters?!? Seriously? They were 3.75 each. The most expensive I've seen oysters is $2.50 and that's in NYC. So that was disappointing. \n\nWe had just had a big lunch at the brewery so we also split a crab cake poboy. When that came out we were shocked again. It was half a sandwich with ONE crab cake. And worst of all the bread tasted like it was a week old. Stale and gross. It was also $20 that. I'm sorry but that is just a rip off. $20 for half a sandwich is outrageous. \n\nAll in all don't come here. The food was bland and just flat out sucked. And for the price they serve it at? You could get food twice as better at half the price. The only good things were our server and the cornbread. He was very friendly and took really good care of us. But if I'm ever in the area again I'm just going to push this place out of my mind.\n" u'The oysters were beyond awesome! The service was quick and the staff knew their oyster info! We had the catfish and crab cakes in addition to the oyster sampler and peel and eat shrimp. Neither meal was overly spicy or flavored. The crab cake was completly brown as if it was fried in too much dark oil.  However the food was tasty. The oysters were fantastic!\n' u"By far one of the best eateries in Ithaca anyone can go to! This place serves Cajun style food. The decor reminds me of a good New Orleans restaurant. \n\nThe decorative light covering especially looks beautiful and gives the place a sensual and sexy appeal. Maxie's features a southern style approach with the window treatments. Maxie's opens the outside balcony for summer dining. The restaurant outside looks like a large house converted into a restaurant. Very southern approach. \n\nOn Sunday nights a musical band plays some bluesy tunes to end the night. This creates a relaxed and more laid back atmosphere at Maxie's. People like listening to this band. The wait staff does an excellent job in making the patrons feel welcomed. \n\nI ordered the vegetarian jambalaya. It tastes absolutely heavenly! I usually order the Ithaca root beer with the jambalaya. Tastes awesome! The city of New Orleans will be so proud and honored to know this exists in Ithaca! Another legend in the making. \n\nWhen in Ithaca come to Maxie's Supper Club. The warmth smiles service (and especially the awesome food) create for an amazing dining experience. \n\nCome and enjoy Maxie's. You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.\n" u'The atmosphere is very cool and hip.  The service was very good.  We came to this place around 8:45pm on a Friday night.  Unfortunately they were sold out of about 5-6 entrees and specials by this time.  Thought that the food was average.  I had the peel and eat shrimp as an appetizer and the jambalaya as an entree.  Both were ok but not great.  My wife had the Cancun popcorn (crawfish) which were good and one their specials which was scallops served on sweet basil palenta with crab and cognac which she thought was very good.  Unfortunately they had a special bread pudding dessert that I would have liked to try but were unfortunately sold out of.  Overall a nice place with good overall service but was expecting a little more out of the food.\n' u'Huge fan of this southern themed restaurant. Large darkly lit intimate place with live music. Service was very polite and attentive and food came out super promptly. We got the large gumbo and the shrimp and grits. Both were delicious in particular the shrimp and grits. Wanted to drink the sauce it was so good. Prices were a little steep but make sense given the huge portions. We saw people splitting dishes which might have been a good idea.\n' u'We went here to try this restaurant because we\'d heard good things AND because they were part of the "Ithaca Loves Teachers week" where we got BOGO entree.  We literally enjoyed everything we ordered (salad app entrees side bread drinks) and on this night we ordered a bottle of wine ($10 off a bottle on Monday nights) iceberg wedge fried green tomatoes crab crake entree chicken fried chicken entree and a Warsaw mule all for $65.00!  Very cool atmosphere and everything ordered was nicely done. I would definitely return when in the mood for cajun/creole.  Props to this restaurant for participating in/honoring teachers (week) and offering such a great deal! Cheers to you!\n' u"I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 7. We used the 30 minute call ahead feature which I loved!  Parking can be an issue as the lot next to the restaurant is very small.\n\nThe place\nWe arrived and were promptly seated though at the worst table in the place.  Our table was right next to the door.  They have curtains by it but the small hallway acts like a funnel. So every time you open the door the wind made you shiver!!  Also bar stools have no backs and are small. I am by no means a big guy and I cant remember the last time I sat in a more uncomfortable chair!  The bar stools weren't the right height to go with the table.  I saw they have another sections of the restaurant with chairs I would HIGHLY ADVISE to ask to be seated there.  Those stools are liking sitting on hemorrhoids!! \n\nThe food\n\nThey brought out cornbread which I am not a big of. However this really good. It was moist and had a sweet flavor! Our waitress said they smoke their own meats so I decided to go with the ribs.  They were ok at best just like any chain store you would order them at.  I guess I will take part of the blame since this a southern/seafood place and I ordered ribs.  My wife had the fried chicken which she said was ok.  I will say I tried some of her fries and they were really good!  They had great flavor and had no need for and condiments!\n\nThe service\n\nOur waitress was very attentive and took really good care of us.  Our drinks were always full and she struck a great balance of checking on us without hovering.\n\n\nThe verdict\n\nI would like to go this place 3.5 stars if I could. I really want to come back and try some more of the dishes I have a feeling it might move to a 4 star.  If you go make sure you try more of their signature items like the seafood.\n\nBonus thought\nTheir bathroom sink was the smallest I have ever seen it was close to the same size as the ones in your airplane bathroom!\n" u'This is one of my favorite spots in Ithaca. The space is beautiful and they have amazing food. Whenever I have friends in town this is the spot I like to take them to. They serve a basket of cornbread as an appetizer and it is just the perfect way to start your meal no matter what direction you are heading. I have had many of their fish dishes (too many to name and sometimes it\'s a special) and they are always cooked perfectly with amazing sides. I have had their sweet potato puree and it is wonderful. You also have the option of picking your sides as well.\n\nMy friend and I have been here on multiple occasions and we almost always order a small order of shrimp and grits to share. I myself was skeptical the first time since I am not a big fan of grits but one taste and I never looked back. The grits here are creamy and not "gritty" at all. They are seasoned well and go great with their shrimp.\n\nMaxie\'s has a great happy hour seafood special for clams oysters and mussels so if you are a seafood fanatic come before 6pm. On certain nights they also have life bands playing and kids specials (extremely reduced price for kids meals - fantastic for folks with children). Parking can be tricky so consider that if you are coming at peak hours.\n\nI will be back for sure.\n' u"From homemade pickles served on the side of my sandwich to black currant infused iced tea to boardwalk style fries (served with malt vinegar!) to homemade cornbread with orange-honey butter the food is thoughtfully and deliciously prepared. \n\nGreeter and server were very friendly. We were seated and served quickly. \n\nLarge vegetarian menu and an actually appetizing (!!) kids menu were impressive and a refreshing change from most restaurants. \n\nThe tofu po boy sandwich was fantastic as was fish & chips. Can't believe we haven't tried Maxie's sooner! We'll definitely return! \n\nNote: $2(!!) kids meals on Wednesdays!\n"]
106.Four Seasons,[u'Authentic Korean food. I go there almost every week. I was very impressed by fact that they pack the side dishes and miso soup in takeouts. Great service when they are not too busy\n' u"So I'm really surprised by all the negative reviews here. This is a great Korean Bbq place for a college town like Ithaca. We enjoyed both the food and service. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Shumai and the seafood pancakes. The Shumai was disappointing but the seafood pancakes were delicious. \n\nFor the main course we shared the Combination A korean bbq which had good size helpings  of pork shortrib shrimp etc. Everything was very flavorful and the lady  came to our table often to make sure that we turned the bbq over correctly :). We also ordered pork chapchae which was good not great. \n\nThe owner also brought us the traditional tofu and seafood soup complimentary which was wonderful --- just the right level of spices and the tofu and the seafood worked really well. \n\nAs in most Korean places they brought small dishes in the beginning to share. Some like the kimchi were quite good others were okay. \n\nA great overall dining experience.\n" u"It seems that this place has gotten a lot better from the past when all of the negative reviews were written. I was very satisfied with my meal! I got the bulgolgi dinner box and everything was tasty. The meat and the clear noodles were awesome and the fried rice and dumplings were good too! The salad was also a nice touch. The servers were friendly and attentive and the food came out so quickly (we hadn't even finished eating the small dishes and miso soup that came with our meal before our actual dinner boxes came out). I would say an all-in-all great meal! It might have been a tad bit on the expensive side but I think that there was a fair amount of meat and food to justify it.\n" u'I have been to Four Seasons several times for lunch and dinner. The food there was great especially the lunch special Kimchi Pork with rice. I also loved their Korean seafood pancake. \n\nHowever on my most recent visit I was very disappointed by how understaffed the restaurant was during busy hours. It took them literally 30 minutes to bring us a check and receipts. The server showed little concern despite us reminding him multiple times that we are still waiting for a check. At the end we had to walk to the counter.\n\nFood-wise I would give 3.5 stars. Service-wise I would give at most 1. My advice to the owner is to hire more servers during busy hours.\n' u'Fastest service and food-prep I have EVER seen.  Every time I ate there weekday lunch my sidedishes arrived within 30 seconds of having placed my order.  And then my main course would arrive 3 minutes later.  \n\nTheir krn bbq is really really good and they got me started on the jaeyook  kimchi train.  And to this date they serve the best gam ja tang and bu dae jigae that I have had.  And I have had some bad ones oh yes...   \n\nThe wife is kind of a tough one but the hubby looks like a nice guy.  When I frequented here back in Uni the server was a Korean guy who was fluent in Chinese!  Wow!  There were a lot of Chinese fobs eating here practically 80%.  I think that Chinese speaking waiter really sealed the deal for me.\n' u"Four Seasons is just about as good as it gets in terms of Korean food in Ithaca. I can't speak to much of its menu but you honestly only need to order one thing there: the dweji bulgogi (spicy pork) lunch box. For $10 you get a huge bowl of fried rice dweji bulgogi miso soup salad dumplings and a few side dishes (kimchi fish cake steamed brocolli). The portion size has gotten a little smaller but I still always leave stuffed. In terms of quality it really can't compare to the Korean food in places like LA. But if you're reading this you're probably in Ithaca so take what you can get. \n\nTips: They give you more if you get takeout instead of dining in. \nThey prepare the food very quickly (to the point that it's questionable). Regardless of how many lunch boxes you order they will be ready within 10 minutes. A conversation my friend had when ordering takeout:\nFriend: can I order 12 lunch boxes? \nWaiter: 12 lunch boxes?!?! \nFriend: yea\nWaiter: ok 10 minutes\n" u'The tofu was expired so  I had to complain The other stuff taste good but the tofu was crappie\n' u'My favorite restaurant in Ithaca and the best Korean food I have ever tried (given I am Asian). The rating on Yelp does not do its justice at all.\n' u"subpar food for extreme prices... they automatically slapped on an  18% tip on our bill and that wasn't really cool.... the service was faster than expected (only one wait staff lady) but could've been more attentive.\n" u"Best Korean food in Ithaca by far. All the Korean students will confirm that. On a hot summer's day nothing better than their Bi Bim Bop. My children loved going here and they still remember them when they come back grown up. They also expanded so you can bring large parties at their prices remain reasonable and the food the best.\n" u'Food was ok on the pricey side. We got the KBBQ combo. Seafood pancake was great. The lady kept on trying to make us order more food throughout our meal which was annoying. Service was not great. Also when we asked if the tip was included in the check she said no. When we pointed out and asked what the 15% charge was she said oh. Pretty sketchy overall.\n' u"Mehhh.... Definitely NOT the place I would go to for Korean food and most definitely not my choice of restaurant if I ever had to dine in Collegetown. Food is average and overly priced. Service is minimal at best. What really bothers me is that the lady in charge is not welcoming in the least but rather incredibly rude. They also modified the amount of tip I left them on the merchant copy of the receipt. The amount wasn't the issue but the fact that they would do that on their own was unprofessional and shady. My advice is to steer clear...\n" u"So far my first Korean restaurant visit here in Ithaca. Spoiled by all the authentic Korean restaurants in California the food here tastes mediocre.  I ordered soon tofu 5 small dishes came and the kimchi tastes like refrigerated for days; the soon tofu tastes like soup powder that anyone can make at home. Service was attentive perhaps because we were the only table there on a Friday night. It was a little sketchy at first that no one was there but the owner from green castle recommended this place so we decided to give it a try regardless. The portion and price is similar to what I've had before. \n\nWill try other places before deciding to come back or not.\n" u'Ordered 15 dollar stew noodles and i get a quarter pack of generic ramen noodles not even cooked floating atop a mish mash of random ingredients slowly burning in the tiny flames of a fifth grade metal crucible\n' u'There is a special sake menu especially designed to rip drunk patrons off.   The portions are ridiculously small for the price.  Food is alright but taking advantage of the inebriated is frowned upon in my book\n' u"The staff here isn't that friendly. Not once did I see any of the staff members smile to anyone. Some people say that it's because they're only friendly to the Korean customers but some Koreans were in here at the same time as me and they didn't get friendly service either. They did however get a lot more banchan than I did. And not just quantity but they also got more variety. Preferential treatment perhaps?\n\nI went for the mool naeng myun since it's still fairly warm in Ithaca. Not as big as I would have liked and the presentation wasn't that appealing. After the noodle everything else was kinda just thrown in there. The dish was okay but nothing to rave about. The noodles were tougher than other Korean restaurants I've been to and the beef was kinda overcooked.\n\nThey do lunch specials on weekdays which look a lot more reasonably priced than their regular menu. Probably best to come here between classes rather than dinner.\n\nMediocre overall and Koko up the hill is definitely better. The advantage of this place is that it does Korean barbecue and seems to be the only place in the area that does it. I'll give this place a try again for that when I feel like splurging. But aside from barbecue Koko wins in price service and quality.\n" u'Perhaps it is a bit unfair of me to write such a bad review since the last time I ate at Four Seasons was in April 2014 however this used to be a very good restaurant and was far from it a year and a half ago.\n\nIt was my first meal there since the restaurant expanded and took over extra space from the store next to it.  The staff was not the same as years past.  They were rude ignored us before and after finally taking our order (this was a big group too eight people).\n\nOne of our friends wanted some hot tea.  He was told by the wait person that it was "out of season" only served during the winter. It was the first week of April!  My wife and I ordered dishes with chicken.  The meat was tough.  It had been pre-cooked and thrown into the meal.\n\nA very bad experience all around\n' u'I used to frequent this place 15-16 years ago as an MBA student at Cornell.\n\nThis past weekend I was back in town for my reunion.  Thought it\'d be nice to take my wife to my old favorite joint for lunch.  \n\nSince we had our little dachshund with us we decided to get it "to-go" (knowing that dogs are not allowed in restaurants).  When we went to pick up the food my wife and uncle went inside; and I stayed outside holding my dog.  When my wife same out she was hopping mad. And I mean hopping mad!\n\nFound out later on that the guy at the restaurant was extremely rude to her.  When he saw me outside with the dog he belted out to my wife "no dog" "I don\'t want your dog in here!".  As my wife kept explaining to him we had NO PLANS to bring our dog in he kept going on and on about how dogs are not allowed in his restaurant lecturing her as if she was a little misbehaving school girl.  He was rude arrogant and dismissive.\n\nI had read about the "unfriendly service" on yelp but this is beyond unfriendly.  He was practically being an asshole.  A stupid one no less because he apparently had no comprehension skills and could not understand what my wife was trying to explain to him.  ("I understand the rules.  We were NOT planning on brining out dog in here.")\n\nAs for the food -- it sure has gone downhill.  The bimbimbap we ordered was crap.  The beef tasted stale and lettuce!!  Oh gawd the lettuce.  Who freaking puts stale lettuce in bimbimbap?!  Geez.\n\nYou could not PAY me to eat here.\n\nDon\'t go just don\'t go.  Asshats like him deserve to go out of business.\n' u"Four Seasons has I think some of the best Korean food in Collegetown. The soon tofu is quite tasty (order it extra spicy) and the bibimbap is solid. That having been said the atmosphere could be a bit better. Some of the tables are placed very close to entrances and when the door opens you definitely feel it. This isn't so much an issue during the summer but the Ithaca winters can be a bit harsh.\n\nService can also be a bit slow even when there aren't many people in the restaurant. The wait staff is very good about seating people promptly and taking orders but they don't really pay attention to the tables after the food is delivered. Many is the time that I've sat with an empty glass of water for almost 10 minutes without anyone coming to refill it.\n\nOverall 4 stars for the food but 2 for the service.\n" u'There are great things about four seasons but also not too great things. In general the food is delicious and the service is good. However I found its menu a little confusing and my friends and I often got lost reading the menu. \n\nRecommend: pork rib with potatoes casserole-the portion is huge and the soup just tastes homy and wonderful. The kimchi with pork (and rice cake and tofu) is also good I almost order it every time.\n']
149.Plantation Bar and Grill,[u"No problems at all here with the food drinks or service. It's just your basic bar and grill and the food/beer is as you would expect. They have typical bar things like pool tables darts an outside patio and different seating areas. The beer selection is not fancy but they do have a good mix of standards and a few craft beers from the area. The night we went they had Ithaca Cascadilla and Hopshire Beehave on tap among other things.\n\nThe food is above average for bar food--they have some good burgers and fries! If you are craving such food after a couple beers as we were it really hits the spot. The fries are nice and crispy and well-seasoned.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly--I couldn't ask for anything more.\n" u"Pretty good service. \nJerk chicken sandwich was awesomely yummy (special). Fried green tomatoes: tomatoes were good but I didn't like the sauce. Sauce was very acidic and odd tasting. I had to use ketchup or honey mustard for dipping. Cajun fries were cooked AND seasoned perfectly. Very much a local bar scene very casual spacious outdoor patio seating. Good prices. Nice staff.\n" u"I've been here many times. They always manage to wrong me in some way. After  three strikes I try to avoid this place.\n\nStrike 1: The waitress swiped my card 3 times. There was an issue with the computer where it wouldn't settle the transaction but still put a PreAuth on my card. It never actually posted to my account but my bank charged me overdraft fees since I didn't have the amounts that the PreAuths called for and I wasn't anticipating three $50 charges on my checking account.\n\nStrike 2: I like ranch with my fries so I asked the waitress for some. She gave me a tiny portion cup of generic ranch and then charged me extra on my bill. Literally the only restaurant that has ever charged me extra for sauce.\n\nStrike 3: I tried to order the Jack Daniel's burger but the waitress wouldn't let me because I wasn't of age. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Nobody from the liquor authority is going to come into your restaurant and perform sting operations on your fucking burgers. Rogues Harbor has a similar burger and I have never been carded.\n\nI give it 3 stars because the food when I can get it is usually pretty decent.\n" u'Awesome roadside grill that serves real food!  Cute waitresses great local beer KILLER cheesesteak sandwich.  Make a detour for this place...\n' u"Went back again... I guess just go to drink. The food is nasty.\n\nEverything is soggy and fresh from a Sysco bag. The fries used to be good... I'm not sure why things have gotten worse. Staff?\n" u"I am a carnivore and I got their cheeseburger with pulled pork on it. I asked for medium on the burger and it was well done dry and under seasoned. The sweet potato fries had the right idea: good taste crispy on the outside smooth on the inside but...  some parts of the fries were almost burnt. My husband's sandwich was good - the Phat Pig and the beer was reasonably priced. I told the server about the burger and she gave us a free beer. She said they were really busy but they didn't appear unreasonably busy to me. I love food and I'll try it again if someone invites me but not on my own.\n" u"So I was very reluctant to give this place a try but I am glad I did. Went out on Saturday at about 4 in the afternoon and it was pretty dead which was fine with me. \n\nThe server was nice but seemed like she might had been having a bad day. The atmosphere here isn't great it's a bar after all and you can tell this place has been around for awhile. It was still pretty clean nonetheless and if it had been warmer I totally would've eaten outside as they have a great patio.\n\nI ordered a dozen garbage wings (mixed up all sauces) to start and they were pretty amazing. Might even be the best here in Ithaca. They were big and crunchy on the outside yet nice and juicy on the inside. My wife got the boneless wings with their garlic parm sauce and that was amazing only had a little breading and a lot of chicken with those which is usually not something you get usually it's all breading.\n\nI ordered the Jack Daniels burger for my entree as naturally my favorite burger in the world is the T.G.I.Fridays Jack Daniels Burger. It was huge the patty was wide and thick which was great. The bun soaked up the juices but held itself together nice and firmly and didn't leak out the bottom. The onion rings on the burger were crispy not soggy it came with 3 slices of bacon and the JD Sauce which was quite amazing. Now it tasted for like a bbq sauce mixed with JD but it was good! I ordered lettuce and tomato with my burger as in my opinion a burger is not a burger without them. The only regret I have about this burger was that I didn't order a side of the sauce as there was not enough on the burger though I love a lot of sauce on my burger.\n\nI had the Cajun French Fries on the side and by god they were amazing. I don't know what they put on the fries but these might had been the best fries I've ever had. They were hot crunchy and the seasoning was out of this world. A bit salty spicy and you could definitely get those Cajun flavors. It was the perfect addition and they put a lot of fires on the side!\n\nThe last reason this place gets a 5 star is because of the price quality and quantity. The portions were huge the prices were inexpensive and the quality was amazing!\n\nDefinitely get out and try this place you won't regret it!\n" u"i only got to check this place out once but next time i'm working in the area i will definitely give it another shot. i like the looks of the place inside lots of dark wood and kinda divey but it would be a good place to hang out with a group of friends and let loose. the bartender that was there didn't seem like the most friendly woman on the planet and then she pretty much ignored me after i placed my order but maybe she was just having a bad day i dunno. as for the food the wings i got didn't impress me. it tasted like the fryer oil was old and needed to be replaced and the hot buffalo sauce i ordered had BBQ sauce in it but it did have a nice kick. now for the best part my sandwich. i got the Phat Pig sandwich and while the menu says that the pulled pork is house smoked and that the sandwich has BBQ sauce i didn't feel like that was the case. i picked up no smoke flavor (and it didn't look smoked either) but it was still juicy and flavorful even though they didn't put bbq sauce on it (they did give me a couple packets of some generic bbq sauce though). the ham on it was good but what made the sandwich great was the cajun coleslaw and the bread they used. i will definitely be trying this again and hopefully if they do actually smoke their own pork it would be nice to see some more BBQ items on the menu.\n" u"Hands down best bar in Tompkins County.\n\nOrder The Mel or Wicked Wedges\n\nKaraoke on Tuesdays\nWing/Pizza Special on Thursdays\nF.U.B.A.R. Fridays and the best people you will ever meet in a bar every night of the week.\n\nTrust me I know what I'm talking about.\n" u"The food is surprisingly good for a dive bar (I'm a fan of the turkey sandwich no sauce added bacon). Also their salads are surprisingly good.\n\nIt's fun in the warmer months to fill the jukebox with the most obnoxious music you can think of and have an impromptu dance party on the porch. Speaking of which the porch is extremely dog friendly with little metal hooks to attach leashes to.\n\nThe worst things about the place are probably the location and the times where the combined teeth of the patrons number less than the cars in the parking lot. Of course that's when it's the BEST time to start playing Daft Punk or the Black-eyed Peas on the jukebox!\n" u"The wings are great. Come on a monday they have a great deal on wings and the beer is cheap too. It's best in the summer when you can sit out on the deck but inside has darts and pool which is always great. The fries and sandwiches are good too.\n" u'Seriously good sandwiches and fries.\n\nStick to the sandwiches though.  I tried the prime rib one night and they could not get it right (it was packed in their defense).  Been there a dozen times and only one dud is not that bad.\n' u"Definitely a local dive bar but it has its points.  Some good food coming out of the kitchen and the Tuesday night wing special is a winner.   Outside deck seating is great but the inside could use a lot more work.  The Mens room is tiny and looks like it was converted from a large closet..  Owner tends to hover at the bar glaring at the bartenders to make sure they don't over-pour by a tenth of an ounce which is kind of creepy.  Giant TV behind the bar is nice for sports nights.  Check it out for music on the weekends sometime.  If you don't wear a trucker hat you might stick out in the crowd.\n" u"Just another local dive bar. \n\nThey have lots of tables so it can be a nice place to sit drink your beer and just hang out.  On Monday's they have 25 cent wings which were okay even though they were a bit overcooked.\n\nThe table service can be a little slow.\n"]
38.Collegetown Bagels,[u"This was my first time having a bagel as a meal as opposed to a bagel with cream cheese or the base of a regular sandwich using bagels instead of bread.\n\nI had the E.O.D. It consisted of egg salad on a bialy with green olive spread. The olive spread wasn't overpowering and the whole thing was scrumptious.\n\nThe husband had the Californian I think. It was avocado and egg (and usually cheese too but he skipped it). The counter person recommended the rosemary salt bagel with it. The husband liked the sandwich except for the overwhelmingly salty bagel. The kids shared a bagel with egg and melted cheese.\n\nWe visited in the summer over reunion weekend and that Friday at 9 a.m. it was packed. We ended up with four of us at a two person table.\n" u"I found their place per recommendation of my Airbnb host. The breakfast bagel sandwiches were delicious. highly recommend the rosemary salt bagel with egg and ham.\n\nIt's also a surprisingly good place to work. Plugs are everywhere and internet is fast. What an awesome place.\n" u"Although the name suggests that the specialty here is bagels the bagels aren't particularly good. CTB is really more of sandwich shop that happens to use bagels as the vessel for their sandwiches. That said the sandwiches are good.\n" u"This place is amazing. Everything we tried was great and there's a chalkboard filled with tons of menu options. Service is a little slow which makes sense since it's a really busy place. The interior is really cozy...they also give out free stickers....\n" u"Having gone to college in a collegetown myself this place strikes me as belonging in that type of place for sure. \n\nWhen you walk in you're greeted with 1000 options for bagels sandwiches drinks etc all written in chalk with clever and charming names along one of the walls. I asked the guy at the counter (college student?) for a vegetarian recommendation for a bagel sandwich and got an unhelpful non-answer. I settled on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and jalapeno grape jelly. My hubby got 2 plain bagels per his usual order. We were then checked out by two college students.\n\nI liked my bagel combo. My husband's bagels were literally hard as rock. Like you could knock your fist on them. He braved through it anyway..\n\nIt's a staple of Ithaca but we were thoroughly not impressed with level of bagelry. Collegetown bagels... Good for college students.\n" u'Amazing spot - overwhelming board of food and drink options. Both will cost you on avg $10; college students could go broke here but we enjoyed a pizza garden bagel nutella/banana bagel and "go 2 bed\' drinks - all DELICIOUS. Went to another location near Commons the next day - for some reason it wasn\'t nearly as good - this place on campus was excellent. My 10 year old daughter didn\'t like her first choice in drink and they were nice enough to exchange it for her with no questions asked - good first impression on great customer service and left lasting impression - lol  now she wants to go to college here!\n' u"An Ithaca staple this place has a variety of healthy foods sandwiches drinks and of course bagels! I got a Khloe Kardashian tea and my friends got smoothies. They have cool names for their sandwiches and so many options! Everyone rocks a CTB sticker on their water bottle or laptop it's a must when in town.\n" u'We were visiting Ithaca to checkout wineries. Wanted to find a restaurant near Cornell.\n\nGreat food. Fun atmosphere with lots of outdoor tables and picnic benches. I had the  roundhouse breakfast sandwich. Wow!  My wife had turkey with Brie. Lots and lots of student activity. Will likely return.\n' u'If Collegetown Bagels were anywhere else in Collegetown it wouldn\'t get even a fraction of the business it does now. \nYou enter at one end of CTB order at a counter are asked either "for here" or "to go" and are given a slip of paper with your order on it which you take down to the registers. Along the way you are asked if you want any pastries or coffee/tea which you can order from one of the workers or pick up any of their many "grab and go" items like prepackaged pastas sandwiches cream cheese sodas etc. You pay for everything at the register and they stamp your ticket which is either handed back to you (if you\'re taking it to go) or placed on a numbered stand which you bring to your table. \nIf you\'re anything like me you\'ll develop your go-to order over time: for me if I want something easy and fast I\'ll get a rosemary salt bagel with plain cream cheese which at under $3 makes a nice and easy breakfast on my way to class. If I want a full sandwich I usually get the Sweet Rachel (turkey honeycup mustard muenster cheese and onions on pumpernickel). The Sweet Rachel is my favorite out of the sandwiches I\'ve tried but let\'s be honest it\'s not THAT good. I don\'t think the quality of the ingredients is high enough to justify the cost (roughly $7.50 and that\'s one of the cheaper sandwiches) and it\'s not like there\'s a markup for cooking skill because again it\'s a freakin\' sandwich. Also I like honeycup mustard a lot so I don\'t mind but GOD they really slop it on there. Let\'s just say that if you need a quick fix for congestion this sandwich will really clear your sinuses. \nI\'ve also tried the BBQ jack which is good if you want something gluttonous and warm and the Euro (ham brie honeycup etc) which also has an obscene amount of mustard and isn\'t super good. Another favorite is the flat rock (turkey goat cheese balsamic sun-dried tomatoes basil) which is really good but so so small. I could practically eat three of them but at like $8.50 or something that would be unreasonable. \nThe baked goods aren\'t good at all. Very stale and taste like they\'ve been sitting in that case for weeks. The coffee drinks are good but outrageously priced. I understand they\'re nicer drinks or nicer coffee or whatever but go to Starbucks right across the street. \nI\'ll continue going to CTB but mostly because of the location. The outside seating is also really nice but is only a real pull factor for about 2 weeks of the year (thanks Ithaca). \n\nTL;DR : Crappy Zingerman\'s (Ann Arbor MI) wannabe. Really small overpriced sandwiches. Stale baked goods expensive coffee. One star for the location one star for the service (god bless those workers always positive despite being absolutely slammed with business all the time).\n' u"CTB is a staple of Ithaca at the corner of where bustling Collegetown meets Cornell's central campus.  This place is almost always jammed with students either grabbing a quick meal coffee or a pitcher of sangria to enjoy out on the sunny patio.  Almost everything on the menu is bagel related (which are made fresh daily downtown at their sister store Ithaca Bakery) with dozens of different types of bagels available.  That said the brooklyn bagel sandwich (scrambled eggs with bacon on your choice of bagel) and the pizza bagel are to die for.\n\nService can be on the slow side during peak hours as CTB is a key part of the typical Cornellian's diet.  That said the menu is very affordable (you're in upstate New York after all) with most sandwich in the $5 range.\n\nA must go if you're in town.\n" u"Their food is great don't get me wrong. They seem to use fresh ingredients in their sandwiches and I've always been happy with the paninis I get at CTB.\n\nBut the service is horrendous so I avoid going here a lot. The wait for a sandwich in person can be awfully long even if it's not complicated. So you may think ordering online for pickup is the solution right? It'll just be ready when you get there...right?\n\nNope. Out of the three times I've ordered to pick up I've had to wait an extra ten to fifteen minutes past the pickup time because they haven't even made the sandwich. This is utterly unacceptable especially since there are 20 minutes in between the order time and the pickup time.\n\nAnd often when you get there they'll forget that you're still waiting for your sandwich because the staff behind the counter is really uncoordinated. Even when there are a ton of people working they seem to just go at the same pace.\n\nSo yeah it's nice for a treat once in a while but I can't go here regularly because of service issues.\n" u"Love CTB. First tried them at Ithaca Bakery. The bagels taste like any chain bagel place bagels. I'm from NJ so I'm not trying to be a bagel snob. For upper NY bagels they're pretty good. What I really enjoy about CTB is all the toppings and options they have and of course you can customize anything you want. \n\nThey're also quick and adorable which is what you'd hope for in a place geared toward college students. \n\nThey're bakery items are also delicious and the coffee is a must to go with every meal.\n" u"There are very very few good things about Ithaca but CTB is definitely close to the top of that list. There is so much to love (and just generally so much - what a menu!) about this quintessential Cornell bagel joint. The ambience is pretty standard for a collegetown breakfast joint - a little divey but overall a casual and colorful place to get breakfast.\n\nThough they do not have everything bagels (which are a notable weakness of mine) CTB does have salt bagels. These seem to be a fancier pretzel bagel - one even comes with rosemary salt whatever that is. I can't remember the name of either sandwich I had; one was egg & bacon and the other egg bacon sausage & a hash brown. Both killed the breakfast sandwich game and my only regret was not getting a third bagel to try.\n\nI didn't try any of their drinks (see reviews of Gimme Coffee/Press Cafe for info on that) but the menu was equally as large as their breakfast choices and every single one I saw brought out to a customer looked as insanely delicious as their bagels. This is the only good thing about Ithaca. Go here.\n" u"I am a fan of CTB and it's somewhere in between being a good or a great place. They have an incredible menu and a lot of sandwiches/drink options which is great and they also have gluten-free bagels and options there which is really nice.\n\nThe thing that's rough about CTB is that their breakfast sandwiches (virtually anything with egg) that I've had all kind of miss the mark. You get a bagel that is piled high with this scrambled egg patty that I know is not artificial but just kind of feels like it is and does not taste very good so it sucks that there's so much of it. There is so much egg that you find yourself having to kind of pick away at it so that the proportion of egg to whatever else you got on your bagel is good. It is possible that I am a fried-egg-on-my-breakfast-sandwich purist.\n\nThey still get 4 stars to me because even though I really dislike anything with egg there are so many other options that are good that I can look past this. Really recommend virtually anything with veggie cream cheese and the Mexican and San Diego bagel/spreads are also really good. I have not had their lunch options but assuming that it's similar to Ithaca Bakery they are probably good.\n" u"Great place to study. Very spacious and open until 1am! My only complaint is the price of the bagels. $7.95 for a pizza bagel? Just expensive in my book as I'm sure it is for lots of college students. A total of 3 bagels cost $25-$30..\n" u"Have only been here about 10 times. Tried a different wrap or bagel every time. They were all terrific. Still there's a few things on the board I'd like to try.\n" u'Awesome sammiches for breakfast lunch and dinner...beer and hippy music on some nights\n' u'The only thing I know about Patrick Ewing is he was a basketball player who appeared in Space Jam! And that the turkey brie and apple sandwich that shares his name is wonderful. We visited Collegetown Bagels for a summer road trip. Our dog was able to sit on the patio with us too. It was buzzing with activity on a Sunday early afternoon making it all the more fun. Great spot for a college bagel shop - and much more.\n' u"Love this place. During grad school I spent way too much money here holed up at Collegetown Bagels studying and just absorbing the environment. Has the classic crunchy granola feel of Ithaca and love that it's a local small business. Prepare for long lines crowded seating with lots of Cornell students and great conversation. \n\nAwesome coffee brewed to perfection incredible bagel sandwiches and all the desserts you could ever dream up.\n" u'For a casual eating experience with a wide variety of choices I was completely pleased with CBT. I was here for dinner with my teenage son & didn\'t want or need anything fancy or expensive. Outdoor patio seating was great on a lovely evening. Could totally see this a a terrific place to hang out. In fact as we were walking around the "Collegetown" section of Ithaca things seemed completely dead until we rounded the corner to the CBT patio - THERE were all the people! Lively conversation and folks enjoying their food and beers.\n\nOur food was terrific. Yes the menu is overwhelming for a newbie. SO many choices!! SO hard to decide!! I went with the 5k because peanut butter banana granola etc just sounded good and it was! Every finger-licking bite! They even had pears so he offered to include this in the wrap too. Yum! \n\nMy son got the Round House bagel super tasty. Loved the Rosemary salt bagel it came on. He was disappointed that the fountain drinks are not refillable. We also got a fruit tart and a cannoli (cuz hey we\'re on vacation and we hiked 7 miles today so why not!) ;-). Not the best cannoli I\'ve ever tasted but a nice treat all the same. Fruit tart was also good. \n\nAll that food plus the fountain drink set us back $22 which I thought was pretty darn reasonable. \n\nI just might be back before we leave town.\n']
98.Akashi Hibachi & Sushi,[u"They actually have some pretty good sushi here which is not what I expected out of a mall food court. The rainbow roll in particular was really good. The pieces they give are very generous in size. They also have some teriyaki combos which are reasonably priced.\n\nI didn't order a drink but the person working here was nice enough to give me a complimentary soda as I sat at the table in the food court. I wouldn't expect this during busier times but it just shows that the people here are very nice.\n" u"This place was my absolute favorite for lunch when I used to work in the mall. I just came back here the other day and I have to say that it's still delicious. \n\nThey serve sushi and also different types of teriyaki combos that are made fresh when you order. I also get the chicken teriyaki. It comes with a delicious teriyaki sauce seasoned vegetables and your choice of white or fried rice.\n\nAlso if you work at the mall make sure you use your mall employee discount.\n" u"Easily the best place in the food court (though they don't have much competition). The owners also run Easy Wok the hot-tray Chinese place next door. \n\nAkashi does made-to-order stir fries and sushi for a reasonable price. I usually get the teriyaki chicken. The sauce is flavorful and the chicken has a bit of a sear. The vegetables mostly consist of cabbage/bok choy in garlic sauce but I enjoy it. \n\nI don't know anything about the raw sushi but I have ordered the shrimp tempura roll a few times. I was impressed to see that they cooked the shrimp to order (as opposed to grabbing it from a hot tray). It's pretty darn delicious especially for mall sushi.\n" u'This was surprisingly great!  They made my. Chicken and shrimp teriyaki fresh in front of me - it took a few minutes but was worth the wait. The chicken was a little crispy and it was all really tasty!  Friendly service and a fun drink selection. definitely my first choice at the mall.\n']
46.Koko Korean Restaurant,[u"The friendliest service in Ithaca I think. I came here a ton during college when I craved Asian food and the lady who owns the place won't turn you away or rush you even if you accidentally show up half an hour to closing. She and the waitstaff are all so smiley and sweet. \n\nThe food is great too; my favorite dish is the dol sot bibambop. I will say that when I returned to Ithaca four years after graduation this was the first restaurant I hit up and I think the portions are slightly smaller now. Still the bibambop tasted delicious and the atmosphere made me feel welcome. And like I was in college again.\n" u'A collegetown Korean staple.  Good food friendly service and inexpensive.  A quick lunch or full dinner with a fairly extensive menu\n' u'The meals taste okay but be aware that the dish size is pretty small. The price is pretty high and there is just so many restaurants nearby (literally within 5 min walk) will beat them with better food.\n' u'Did a take out a couple of hours ago found hair. On top of which the containers were poorly packed leading to most of the sauce leaking out into the bag. The chicken was also undercooked. Loved kokos but will probably not go back.\n' u"I really liked our food the side dishes and service here! I got the ubokki which was spicy udon noodle soup. I loved the sauce it was perfectly spicy and a little bit sweet. I usually don't do too well with these spicy red sauces but this one was an amazing flavor. And don't worry it was still spicy enough that I had to drink plenty of water! One thing you might notice is that I've been referring to it as a sauce rather than a soup. Just beware of that when you're ordering but I actually liked that it was more of a sauce than soup. \n\nOne thing I would recommend is probably getting this dish with the ramen noodle instead. Since there are rice cakes in it too it got to be a little to heavy since it was a lot of that dough. I love udon noodle though so I can't say that I regret my decision! Another small thing I noticed is that there were hardly any vegetables but I'm one to be satisfied with just plain noodles and sauce. Just something to keep in mind! For the price I felt it was fair.\n" u'We ordered the Tofu Soup and the Pa Jun both were excellent. We have eaten at lot of Korean restaurants all over the US and this is among our top 5. We will definitely be comming back for more\n' u"I went to Koko Korean Restaurant with my three friends for lunch on Sunday. The restaurant's ambience was quiet and clean. I really liked the inside: wallpaper full of Korean characters wooden tables and chairs nice background Korean pop musics and delicate Korean silverwares. The owner greeted us with a smile and took us to a table. \n\nWe each ordered one main dish and together ordered a large Korean pancake to share. The Korean pancake was amazing. Flavorful and delicious. The crispy crust together with the dipping sauce was very addicting not to mention the softwarm cake flour inside. I would definitely recommend the Korean pancake. Note however that it contains no meat which is fair since it is as described in the menu.\n\nAnd here starts my frustration. I ordered Dduk Gook ($10.00) for my main dish and was shocked to see 5-6 (at most) thin strips of beef (see the picture). The rest were egg vegetable and an abundant amount of rice cakes. The dish was nearly vegetarian. The soup was also bland but I believe that's the way Dduk Gook is supposed to be. To make matters worse the server forgot to serve us a complimentary kimchi set. \n\nNot the best Korean food I have had. I almost gave 2-star but luckily the Korean pancake saved the day.\n" u'Kokos is probably one of the best restaurants in college town. The have yummy foods and their quality is very consistent. I have been multiple times and have never been disappointed with anything they served.\n' u"My absolute favorite Korean restaurant in Ithaca! The rabokki is delicious and has a pretty fair price tag. Koko is so homey and the lady who seems to run the place is extremely nice to everyone who stops by. I'm always craving the food here.\nCome by for comfort food!\n" u"First the portion is too small. I can easily finish so called hot pot dinner for two by myself. The soup is so watered down and the taste is also very alwful. Worst of the worst the seafood they served is not fresh at all. PLUS we paid  34 dollareach for such a terrible dinner. I won't recommend this place to any friend who has self respect.\n" u"We ordered the kimchi soup and a fish soup. The flavor was not bad but their soup was the watery kind not the thick bone broth kind. The problem I have here is that for the price we're paying (I remember it was like $13/person or something before tips) the portion is not big enough. They give you a decent amount of the soup but there was only a few leaves of kimchi and three pieces of tofu. With the rice it was enough but it was just a sad bowl of kimchi soup. On the other hand my boyfriend who could not eat rice had to go buy another meal cuz he only found three pieces of fish fillet and two pieces of tofu in his soup.\nOverall it's ok if you dont eat much and craving korean food.\n" u"Extremely bad seafood pot. I don't understand how this restaurant becomes a popular place in collegetown. The tofu is not soft. The fish is not fresh. Will not come back again.\n" u"Very reasonable and tasty food.\n\nWe ordered more than what we could chew but it was delicious nonetheless. Kimchi Pa Jun - Lightly pan-fried wheat batter with kimchi ( very pancake like with some veggies in it and lastly kimchi) The soy sauce they gave didn't suffice so I immersed my dish with soy sauce that was served at the table.\n\nWe then ordered DOOBU KIMCHI BOKEUM- pan fried tofu and kimchi in special spicy sauce (pork) choice( I didn't get to eat this since I'm a vegetarian. But I was told it tasted really yummy!)\n\nWe also got the RAMYUN with Cheese. Now if you're Indian or have snacked Indian ever you would've heard of MAGGI. Well my friends this tasted exactly like that except the Ramyun was made here and it had cheese in it. So yay to that!\n\nI had a good time the service was pleasant and we were fed well by the end of it!\n" u'This is an expensive place to eat for a college student.  For four people for lunch it cost $60.\n\nFor the prices that I paid there could have been more material in the dishes.\n' u'Typical korean restaurant with a variety of menu options. I have only been twice and each time the tofu soup was too salty for my tasting. Also it was crowded each time I went.\n' u'I almost gave this place a 3 because the service as a fast and good but the food was mediocre and "cheap" for the price.   We ordered the bi bim bop Spicy Dak Gui with chicken ($13) and a soft tofu spicy soup with beef ($9.99).  The bi him bop was  ok ($12) but very little meat and veggies.  We asked if the chicken dish had vegetables and the server said yes.  Vegetables consisted of a few scallions on top.  I also asked if the soup had vegetables and got a yes.  Not a vegetable to be seen. And the "beef" were tiny crumbles of grizzle in the soup.  The best part of the meal was the kim chi and assorted dishes of pickled vegetables that came with the meal.  There is no alcohol served and very bad pop music playing in the background.\nIt seemed to me that the prices were not high but they were not low. It seemed like they made an effort to include cheapest ingredients - rice soup base but really skimped on the meat and veggies.  This place is filled with asian students from Cornell - which made me think it was really good but I think it is analogous to the mediocre burger joints that american students go to in college towns.  If I had paid only $6-7 for the small bowl of soup with tofu and grizzly beef instead of $10 I might have given them a "3" rating.\n' u'Good Korean for Ithaca. Authentic and mostly Korean patrons. Bulgogi was excellent. Bibimbap was average.\n' u"I had a weekly lunch with a friends and we chose Koko about half the time. Koko probably deserves a 3 star rating but since their prices are reasonable and alternatives are lacking Koko earns another notch.\n\nI typically order one of their box meals which provide a small variety of things to eat and is reasonably priced for lunch. The other popular item my friend enjoys is the R4 it's like an omelet with rice inside that is huge. \n\nSeating is comfy but not spacious groups of 4 or less fit comfortably but larger groups may struggle. Food arrives quickly and is of consistent quality.\n" u"Probably the best Korean restaurant in Collegetown. My friends and I may have an unhealthy addiction to this place. It has a great variety of options but is in no way overwhelming and the food is always good. This place is definitely not a bargain expect to pay between 10-16 dollars for an entree. But in my opinion it's worth it. The service is fast the restaurant is comfortable and if you call ahead they'll have a table waiting for you. Always a safe bet for Collegetown asian food!\n" u"I like coming here for the lunch specials. You get a good amount of quality Korean food for a little under $10. Given how expensive Korean food tends to be this is a ridiculously good deal. I once got a kalbi lunch box which gives you a decent serving of meat and some rice japchae salad sushi and miso soup. It's certainly not the amount of meat you would want for $10 but at least they give you a bunch of other stuff to make it a decent meal. Another time I got the stone pot bibimbap. I'm used to seeing regular bibimbap for over $10 and having a stone pot always makes it slightly more expensive so it was great that here you can get the stone pot for less than $10.\n\nFood comes with four dishes of banchan. I would have preferred more but at least they didn't just give me kimchi like some other places do.\n\nOutside of the lunch specials this place can be pretty expensive. But the prices are pretty similar to what I've seen in California so I'm not too put off by it especially since the food quality and service are up to that standard. I came here for dinner once with a friend from undergrad while she was helping her sister move in and we had a pretty big meal here that wasn't too costly (each had an entree and split an appetizer for ~$15). I had the naeng myun and it was a big bowl and had plenty of noodles and wasn't overloaded with ice so it was well worth the money. The appetizer we split was the rice cakes which were pretty good too.\n\nSometimes they have a cotton candy machine out but I've only seen it once so I don't know what their schedule is for putting it out.\n\nThis is one of my favorite spots in Ithaca so far and I see myself coming here a lot more in the upcoming year.\n"]
70.Rulloff‚Äôs,[u"Rulloffs has the best nachos ever. Hands down. I order nachos at every bar I go to and I've never had any even close to as good. (Side note: don't order nachos at the Nines).\n\nThe staff is really friendly and will remember you after a couple times. It's really great when the staff already knows your favorite drink. Some of the waiters I really like are Jacob and Jordan.\n\nThe drinks are kind of pricey and mostly not worth it. But sharing a pitcher and a plate of nachos with some friends is one of my favorite memories at Cornell.\n\nP.S. Ask for a treasure island from Rob the bartender. It's amazing.\n" u"Students come to Rulloff's for the great bar which easily beats out any other location in Collegetown. However it is truly the food from the traditional  burgers & tatter tots to the Swordfish or pasta entrees that scores this restaurant 5 stars.\n\nFrom the great location ample parking in either the garage or on the streets and they even take reservations Rulloff's is defiantly my number one choice in Ithaca when I want a meal I leave satisfied and full from! (And I'm also a huge foodie so I've been to almost every restaurant in Ithaca!)\n" u"Great place to drink. I like Margarita best! Very fresh and with salt on the edge of the cup. Also Tequila sunrise is also another recommendation. Haven't tried others yet. Good environment for drinking especially when semester is over!\n" u'We stopped here for a bite to eat on a quiet weeknight during winter break.  The nachos and truffle fries were good. The tuna wontons were horrible one tiny niblet of tuna per wonton and some carrot shreds otherwise hollow and they were deep fried until burnt.   I should have gotten a burger.\n' u"We got there and it didn't look too busy. We were seated as soon as the hostess / waitress came out of the back.\n\nDrinks came right away and we then ordered and appetizer and 3 entrees. \n\nAnd then we waited.\n\nAfter about 35 minutes the place was a fair bit busier and our entrees arrived. We had tried to flag the waitress down a few times about our appetizer but she was now trying to help everyone else.\n\nShortly after our entrees came and I tried to ask about canceling the appetizer but she basically put the food down and went right back to the kitchen. Moments later she came back with the the appetizer and we told her that we no longer wanted it as there's no point to it now. \n\nShe rather rudely exclaimed that we hadn't asked for it to come as an appetizer. When I explained that I didn't think I would need to ask for an item listed on the menu as an appetizer to actually come as an appetizer she informed us that people commonly get that item as a lunch and that we should have let her know?!?!??\n\nWell we apologized and again informed her that we no longer wanted the item so she huffed and took it away. \n\nBut I mean what the heck? Let her know that we wanted the appetizer as an appetizer?\n\nThe reason they get 2 stars instead of one is because the food that we did receive was good. \n\nBut I have a hard time imaging going back there ever again.\n" u"I love Rulloffs. I'm not from the Ithaca area but everytime I am at Cornell for one reason or another I try to go to Rulloffs. From what locals have told me it's more of a dive bar but I've come here a few times before 9PM and each time has been free of beer sloshing to and fro and relatively clean and enjoyable experiences. The ambiance is great (I love the music they play...Hall and Oates Steely Dan..good stuff). The menu has a lot of different options some of which probably sound better than they are but overall there's enough on there to keep me excited for my next Ithaca trip.\n\nFor dinner I got their version of the Shepard's pie. It was interesting. I ate it all because I was hungry but I'm not so sure I would get it again. Looking at most peoples plates around me it seems like you can't go wrong with most things you order the presentation is good and the food is actually tasty. \n\nI'm excited to try some of the burgers (there were a lot) next time I visit Ithaca.\n" u"I went here for the first time a couple of weeks ago with a friend. I was super excited to try something new and the service was quick. I hadn't eaten anything else that day so I ordered their version of shepherd's pie. It came out quick but was small cold and definitely not worth the price. I ended up ordering their poutine after the fact (which was amazing!) because I was so hungry.\n\nTwo stars because my friend found a big clear piece of plastic in her salad- the manager (who never appeared) offered via the waitress to get her a new salad but we settled on having it taken off the bill. Not headed back here any time soon.\n" u"A lot of good burgers here. Very convenient location in college town I must admit. BUT DESPITE THE PROXIMITY the food takes so so so so long. I've been here twice and both times I've been painfully hungry while waiting for my meal. Good for group.... If you want to wait. I still will come back I'm sure; but I have to be ready for the WAIT. Honestly bring snacks. The sweet potato fries are so dank as well\n" u'Was up in Ithaca over the weekend for a race with my buddy and we tried to relive our "glory" days of college with a pit-stop at the new Rulloff\'s. We ended up staying till closing time and did trivia night which we didn\'t know was happening.\n\nThe upstairs has been spruced up for sure but Rulloff\'s looks to have kept much of the old furniture. Downstairs is more of the college bar atmosphere I remember with a dartboard and large screen TVs for sports. I can imagine people getting pleasantly wrecked here when school is in session.\n\nThere are good brews on offer (what a difference 15 years and a craft beer revolution make) and affordable cocktails at $7-8. They were decent actually. We had deviled eggs tater tots and I had a chicken sandwich. Everything was above average if not rising to ambitious "gastropub" levels.\n\nThe staff is friendly--both ladies who tended bar during our drinking shift were pros. Hopefully they can build the crowds back up.\n' u'Popular.  Try the "in a jam" cocktail and the Irish tiramisu.  Delicious!  Probably the most worthy hangout in the neighborhood from a grown-up\'s point of view.  :)\n' u"We decided to dine here for brunch because it looked like a cool spot. Everything just went down hill from there. First our menus said two different things and we were told that one menu was correct. One of us does not enjoy goat cheese and asked if their sandwich could be without. Right on her sandwich was a big plop of ch\xe8vre. The bacon was very burnt. And one of us asked for chocolate chip waffles and they waited came out later and said they didn't have them. On the check he charged us for the chocolate chips ??? The only thing I enjoyed was my soda. This place deserves a two stars for the reasons stated. We will not be revisiting this place anytime soon.\n" u'Service is nice but kitchen is so slow!  Expect at least a 30 minute wait for subpar food.\n' u'Service is rude. I was here with my friends from work visiting on a recruitment trip. At the end of the night the bar tender placed a stack of 1 dollar and 5 dollar bills on the counter and walked away. My friend took a joke picture with these causing the bartender to yell and curse at us. Then as we walked out he yelled that we would never f*cking get back in ever again then followed us out and yelled down the street at us... Sorry not sure what the huge problem was. Not saying we were in the right but plain language would have been sufficient no need for yelling and expletives. it was obviously a joke not as if we were trying to hide the fact we were taking a picture.\n\nNot how to handle relations with your loyal patrons. Not going back.\n' u'This is the best spot in Collegetown (and all of Ithaca). Great food great drinks and amazing service. The vibe is really cool and fun. The cosmos are delicious and the Mac and cheese is to die for. Definitely my go to place in Ithaca!\n' u'Service is terrible. Waited over half an hour at the bar for our table even though we could see it. \n\nServer took over 15 minutes to take our drink and food orders.\n' u'Delicious meal. Tuna wonton appetizer was fantastic. Chicken pot pie and lamb burger were awesome. Great vibe. Great service. Go!\n' u"Love to see what they've done with this space since reopening.  Great selection of beer particularly since Chapter House is no more. Food has definitely picked up enormously from the prior ownership.\n" u'Quickly becoming my go-to lunch spot and definitely my go-to happy hour! Great daily lunch specials and friendly staff. Plus they have great drink deals and the whole place has an Ithaca history theme.\n' u'I used to go to the old Ruloff\'s as a place to grab a casual bite. I admit that the food wasn\'t great but it was a nice place to hang out. Now I go to Ruloff\'s for the food. In fact I crave the food. \n\nI went for lunch one day (they didn\'t have brunch yet!) and got the "Cross the Road". It was delicious. It was a bit too peppery but aside from that fact the chicken was not dry at all and was so flavorful. The bread was delicious and the vegetables that topped the sandwich were the perfect combination. I got a salad with the sandwich and I would recommend that just because they pair very well. The salad greens were fresh and light which was what I wanted. The only complaint I have is that for the price I was paying the portions were small. Also it was pricey for lunch. \n\nI also went for dinner. We got the tator tots (which were standard but good) and the roots (I forgot the name). I would recommend the roots; they were savory and the seasoning really brought out the natural flavors of the vegetables. For the entree I got the Ruloff\'s pie which was very very good. It was not healthy at all (so further reason to get the vegetables earlier) but it was the perfect blend of everything. Once again I did think everything was overpriced because portions were small.\n' u'Food was amazing had the "cross that road" sandwich and the terrain aioli was delicious. The sweet potato fries were absolutely incredible and the maple aioli for dipping them was perfect.  Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a casual dinner with a cool pub atmosphere\n']
162.Northeast Pizza & Beer,[u"Ok so I have given them a few more tries...mostly out of convenience. I have not received another dried out air bubble pizza like before. However one pattern that has persisted throughout is that the pizzas always have 3 inches of big dough on the outside then only 2-3 inches of actual pizza with sauce and toppings. It is so peculiar that they have not fixed this as surely they must be aware of the problem! I mean it can't be the same dude or dudette cooking every pizza I've ordered in the past two years. It's a systemic problem.\n\nIt's quite tasty when you get a decent one. Good sauce. Puny toppings though.\n\nLet's help them out. If you call and order a pizza tell them to please spread the toppings to the crust! There's power in numbers. If enough of us speak out we can change the world one pizza at a time!\n" u'The food isn\'t bad but when ordering through EastStreet/Grubhub make sure you call them and make certain they read the order from the site properly. \n\nI ordered through Eatstreet and the confirmation email said delivery with an address phone number and instructions on how to contact me. I received no call and the person I talked to when I called said they had it was labeled as "Pickup". Hopefully they\'ll respect my cancellation and refund my money.\n' u"There food is fine but if you want to have it delivered to you then don't hold your breath. I waited an hour and 45 minutes for 2 salads during the lunch hour. Also my office is a 5 minute drive from the restaurant. I should have just walked there to get the food but now I know better. \n\nDon't know if they are extremely busy during the lunch hour but it seems a little excessive to wait almost 2 hours for a couple of salads. Unfortunately won't be ordering from them again\n" u'Do NOT order their pizza! It comes BURNT! I called to have another one delivered (which I have never done) and they brought me ANOTHER burnt one. I called back and told the manager and even text him a picture. He called back and told me that\'s how their pizzas look! "They\'re burnt Bc the sauce is exposed to the heat!" REALLY?? This isn\'t my first pizza and I\'ve never had anyone rub sauce on the crust and on top of the cheese so maybe that\'s the problem?! Also my daughter was starving and took 2 bites out of one slice of the first pizza before she realized she couldn\'t chew it Bc it was so rough...and the manager said "Well it looks like someone ate it." REALLY DUDE??!! Who says that? I worked in the restaurant business in the past for over 20 years and I would NEVER talk to a customer like that. Meanwhile I tipped the delivery driver twice so I spent more on tipping than I did on the pizza and ended up having to make dinner myself at 8:00pm!! By the way we ordered at 5:30 so it took 2 and a half hours to finally get our food...that we couldn\'t eat. NEVER will we order from there again!!!!! SO DISAPPOINTED!!!\n' u'I ordered delivery from here. Ordering the pizza was really easy on their site but it took two entire hours for the pizza to get to my door. It was cold by the time it got to me so I had to microwave it. I probably shouldn\'t have tipped online since obviously giving them something generous didn\'t help me out at all.\n\nI ordered a 16" sausage pizza and an order of fries. The pizza was big enough to last several meals. To be fair to them the pizza did taste pretty good. Their meat distribution across the slices could have been better since it seemed like most of the meat was put onto one side and only a few pieces were put on the other.\n\nThe fries were a big disappointment though. They were cold and soggy since it took forever for them to deliver. I had to add a lot of salt since they were so flavorless.\n\nSounds like this place provides a better experience at their actual location. Avoid delivery or order from somewhere else.\n' u'Appalling Quality Offered Without Conscience!!!\n\nI called in an order and went to the store to pick it up.  It was presented to me with a straight face unapologetically and without blinking -- but was such quality that should have been thrown into the garbage.  My pizza was so clearly burnt and mangled that I cannot believe that anyone in business would present such a thing to a customer.  I  paid for it threw it in the garbage where it belonged.\n\nA merchant with such a low-level integrity should not be trusted.\nI will never spend another penny with them.\n' u'Ordered two slices. Apparently there was a mixup in the kitchen and somehow a couple slices got cooked twice. Understandable.\n\nProblem is the manager/owner guy took one look at me told me my slices were ready. He then plated a couple slices. His employee said something like "hey are you sure those are really small." I looked at the plate he gave me and saw two burnt slices about 2/3 the size of a normal slice each. Nice.\n\nI just want to note that I know about the kitchen mixup because I overheard. At no point was I approached and told that a couple slices got overdone and no one explained to me why they were cut so small. (and if I didn\'t mind could I take them?) They just handed me the plate and was like here\'s what you paid for.\n\nI was so insulted. I\'ve been a customer for years. No longer I guess. It\'s a shame because usually the pizza\'s pretty decent.\n' u"The pizza from here was pretty good. This is a cut above your typical New York Style pizza. The crust was good soft and crunchy the sauce wasn't overbearing and there was just the right amount and the cheese was pretty good. The only reason I dock this a star is that the half that had sausage was covered in grease. The plain cheese side was great and the sausage was great but we had to dab the grease off with a paper towel. Granted in the future we'd stay away from the sausage but we'd definitely go back. The prices are pretty decent too plus if you live in an Ithaca Apartment Management apartment you get 10% any size so that's even better.\n\nThe wings were pretty good too nothing to brag about but apparently they have an all you can eat wing night that I'd definitely stop by for sometime. Wouldn't go out of my way to have their wings though.\n\nOverall this place was pretty good definitely one of the better places in Ithaca which is good.\n" u"I really like their Americana style pizza. I have gone on several occasions and every time I have been the pizza has had a lot of cheese on it. They border on a little too much cheese in my opinion and hence why I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5. While their pizza was overly cheesy it also had enough sauce to balance out that extra cheese. The sauce was zesty and tart but still sweet enough to balance out the zesty tartness (if that even makes sense). Two weeks ago when I sat down for dinner with a group of friends for my birthday I asked if they could do a pineapple jalape\xf1o pizza. The waitress said they didn't have jalape\xf1os but recommended we try banana peppers instead. Oh my god that topping combination was heaven. A few months before that I ordered a pizza with red peppers that were not very good so I would say that this was a huge improvement.\n\nPerhaps my favorite item on the menu is their unusual chicken wings. The chicken wings are really crispy but not battered. In addition the buffalo sauce is unique. It has a hint of some sort of holiday spice in it (maybe nutmeg or cinnamon) that really makes them unusual. Everyone at the table loved the wings and wished we ordered more of them. They also have BBQ sauce wings and those were also quite tasty. One person at my birthday dinner ordered boneless wings but I didn't get a chance to try them because the group scarfed them down too quickly.\n\nNortheast Pizza shares a space with Scale House Brew Pub and hence you can order beer directly from the brewpub on tap. I don't usually drink beer so my taste in beer is not very refined but I enjoyed all the home brewed flavors I have tried here. They brew several different kinds but only 3 - 4 of them are actually available at any given time.\n\nEveryday of the week they have a special of the day that rotates and then repeats each week. Some days its a discounted extra large pizza. Other days its an order of wings with a medium one topping pizza combo deal. Either way the specials are the cheapest way to go.\n\nlastly the atmosphere is quite fun. On the brewpub side the scale house has a few TVs that shows various sporting events and also have live music on select nights of the week. Often this music is quite folky. On the other side of the pizza parlor side they have a bowling game machine. The pizza parlor slash brewpub combo makes the place feel kind of like a PG version of a townie bar. I generally prefer to sit on the brewpub side because the appointments are nicer and it got us further from the door so cold air was not blowing on us. You can order things from both places at the tables from either side of the establishment.\n" u"I've gotten pizza from Northeast probably about a dozen times and it's truly been hit-or-miss it seems (mostly hits). Sometimes the pizza is crispy and melty and full of goodness but other times it's seemingly missing any pizza sauce whatsoever and has a layer of unmelted cheese on top covered with grease.\n\nI enjoy the lunch special (which you can still do for dinner) two slices and a soda for just over $5 (I think). Their calzones are decent too and the wings were delicious (buffalo and boneless).\n\nI'll keep ordering from them since it's usually been tasty with a couple of bleh pizzas mixed in. The staff has always been pleasant and friendly even when busy. You can order online too which is convenient.\n" u'Finally a New York Pizza that would never double as a welcome mat this isn\'t that thin stuff you get in the city none of that foldable stuff you can eat as you walk down 43 street in Manhattan. Leave it to Northeast pizza to break the mold that NYers have had to suffer for over the years. This is nice thick pizza with an almost "soft pretzel" style crust. \n\nWalk in there are pizzas ready for the oven just tell the guys behind the counter what you want on it and go have a seat at The scale house brewery in the same building and someone will bring it over to you. This pizza is loaded with cheese so no need to ask for extra unless thats your thing I enjoyed mine with black olives mushrooms (hey gotta get those veggies in the diet) and onions. The sauce is sweet/garlicy the crust is chewy in the center crispy on the bottom. I ordered two slices and they were huge and the cheese was bubbling as it came straight from the oven.\n\nTry it with a speciality beer from Scale House\'s beer selection.\n' u'Really good pizza and wings at a great price.  The staff is friendly and the live music was good.  The food came out very fast and I recommend ordering extra crispy wings.  Recently bought pizza and wings from the nines and Northeast blew their food out of the water.  I would urge anyone to eat at Northeast\n' u"I've always loved northeast's pizza.  The latest time I went I ordered a half barbecue chicken half chicken wing and it was so greasy.  We used several napkins to clean off the grease and still their was a thick layer of grease on the pan.  I had the worst cramps afterwards like I was having a heart attack.\n" u"Came here one time and had the wings. They were good!  I wouldn't say they were the best in Ithaca but far from the worst.  Sorry for the boring review but it was a pretty basic experience.  If I still lived here I would give it a go again for sure.\n" u"Good pizza if you like dough.  Just dough.  Like you're making bread and you just want to try just this once to see what the dough tastes like even though you totally know it's going to be weird and yeasty and unpleasant.  The urge overtakes you and you try it and then you try it again with ketchup and some dehydrated astronaut cheese.  It's like that.  The giant cylinders behind the bar were nice though!\n" u"Pretty good for upstate pizza....we're more used to a slightly crispier crust but they were fast and even delivered to us by the pool at our hotel!\n\nHowever for 5 pies and 3 salads they gave us no forks plates or napkins...so don't forget to ask for them!\n" u"I usually order a small or medium with pepperoni hot peppers and something else to pick up.  Occasionally their orders back up but 8 times out of 10 it's ready by the time I get there- amazingly fast.  The pizza itself is a few cuts above standard NY pizza and to my mind is the best in Ithaca.  Great place to come and sit with the live music.\n" u'IMHO the best pizza in Northeast Ithaca. Their wings are delicious finally good wings in Ithaca. I have been trying to find good wings for a year  The search is over\n' u"Great pizza and wings. They often play live music here to which is sort of strange given the small space. When you walk inside the place is also struggling for an identity: it's half pizza parlor half bar and you're never really sure in which one to sit.\n" u'We went to the Northeast Pizza tonight for dinner at 5:45. When we go there there was one bartender and two waitresses and only two other tables filled up. We received our menus and ordered about ten minutes later (wings pizza calzone). The waitresses didn\'t seem that busy they kept standing around and watching the television. The table that ordered before us received their wings about ten minutes after they ordered. Now we waited (with two children under the age of four)... and waited and waited. The place filled up and still we waited. We waited for about 45 minutes until our wings came (just reminding you that when we got there the place was super quiet seemingly). They were delicious crispy but still juicy. Perfect wings! \n\nAbout ten minutes after we got our wings our pizza and calzone came. The calzone was just okay it needed some garlic or some kind of spice. We got the three cheese pizza with pepperoni. It was pretty greasy but to be expected with three cheeses and pepperoni. The crust was very good and I usually don\'t like crust. Overall I\'d say that the pizza was better than most pizza places I\'ve eaten at in the Ithaca area. Service however sucked! We were only attended to when our food came and when we sat down with our menus. We only got water filled when we sat down and not after. Granted it was very busy and they seem to be understaffed but still. We didn\'t end up leaving until 7:02. \n\nThe other thing the owner is charging a $2 "eat in" fee added to your total bill so beware! I asked the waitress about it but she said that it was just something the owner started doing. If you are bringing kids just be prepared for a possible long wait. I would suggest to order out. \n\nMy score is as follows; \nService: 1 Star\nFood: 4.5 Stars\nAverage of the two: about a two and three quarters so i\'ll round it to a three\n']
82.Friends & Pho,[u"Eat here several times a month plus take out. It's our favorite! We love the staff too extremely friendly.\n" u"Regarding the previous NYC centric review I've lived in NYC and other major cities and have found you have good average and bad restaurants wherever you go NYC & Ithaca included. By the way historically a majority of Chinese immigrants to the USA speak Cantonese I'd also suspect that at a Vietnamese restaurant the workers might possibly be Vietnamese and speak that language. Not sure what your point was to let us all know you speak Mandarin?.\n\nStopped in this place clean friendly service fresh flavorful Pho & great summer rolls. Will be back.\n" u"I had a nice experience here for lunch. The waiter was a little frazzled that I wasn't eating the buffet but I liked the broccoli mushroom dish I got. Not a very vegetarian/vegan friendly place with most dishes centered around meat\n" u'I would rate 0 star for this restaurant. I had a huge white worm in the dish I ordered. By the time I found the worm I already 95% finished my meal there. It was THE worst dining experience that i ever had.\n' u'I hesitated to try Friends and Pho as they advertise as a Vietnamese and Chinese restaurant and the last place I wanted to go to was one of the myriad of Chinese places available. But the name is way cool and we thought we\'d give it a try. The restaurant is nothing fancy which is fine by me as I have learned that fancy decor is not necessarily a reflection on quality of food. We walked in to a big open room filled with various tables. They had a few round tables which I like especially when you are dining with several other people as it is conducive for conversation and no one feels like they are "sitting on the end." It will say it was freezing in there so we all left our coats on. They had a small single electric heater sitting on a table in the middle of the restaurant for heat.\nOrdered fresh and fried spring rolls. Fresh were good nothing special. Fried were the same. Some were dark brown and some were light brown which was odd - I assume that the dark ones were perhaps pre-fried and then fried again before serving. My daughter and I somewhat nervously ordered the Pho and kept our fingers crossed. I absolutely love Pho and have it at any opportunity I can get it. Again it was ok - broth needed more flavor and not a lot of meat which was a tad on the tough side as I think it had been in the broth longer than it should have been. I had to add a lot of Sriracha sauce to it. My husband and son had the lemongrass chicken noodle bowls which again were ok. My son said his had very little flavor so they ended up asking for some extra of the fish sauce that comes with it to kick up the flavor.  My son\'s girlfriend had Chinese beef and broccoli which was average. \nFood: just plain average\nPrice: a little on the high side. It was $90+ dollars for 5 of us not including the tip. \nService: server was very nice and apologetic for the slow service and the food was very slow coming out of the kitchen.\nMenu: if they are going to advertise as a Vietnamese restaurant they need more Vietnamese menu choices as the majority is Chinese. \nConclusion: At the end of the day we rated this place as just average. I would probably go back there if it was someone else\'s idea but it wouldn\'t be my choice.\n' u'I was staying at Econo Lodge across the street and I couldn\'t help but notice he catchy name "Friends & Pho." Ever since I was first introduced to Pho on New Years Eve of 2013 going into 2014 I\'ve been hooked and dying to try pho everywhere I can. With that said I\'m more than delighted to have eaten at Friends & Pho! \n\nWe walked in during lunch time and we sat where we wanted. The waitress walked out of the kitchen quite cheerfully and enthusiastically and that honestly made me even more eager to eat. There was a small buffet under $10 and quite honestly it looked appetizing enough but that\'s not why we were there. \n\nMy step brothers both ordered House Special Pho which includes most of typical beef ingredients that I\'ve found in Pho. I ordered the Seafood Pho. They were all fresh zesty and hearty. And since it was lunch time tea was complementary! \n\n\nWe had good service good food and it didn\'t cost more than $35 for the three of us. I would recommend anyone who passes through Ithaca and loves Pho (or Vietnamese for that matter) to stop by Friends and Pho for a delicious bowl of Vietnamese noodles.\n' u"Delicious but pricey. I'm surprised there aren't more Chinese places on the hill as this joint is all we got. But it's really good so no big whoop.\n" u'Went to this restaurant after visiting Cornell. We came from NYC and did not set high expectation for Pho in this suburban area. However the house special Pho came out surprisingly good. The soup is very hot which is one of the factor when I judge pho. I would recommend this restaurant to people who visit this area. BTW it looks like they do not understand Mandarin although this is a Chinese restaurant. The service is not bad either.\n' u'They have the best tofu & many vegan options. I loved the atmosphere. They were so amazing they actually brought extra broth for my pho (and they offered!). Good green tea as well. All around awesome experience.\n' u"A very nice place to get some delicious Vietnamese or Chinese food. As others have mentioned I believe it is the same chef as the previously iteration of the restaurant but they remade the menu to have more emphasis on Vietnamese food and all the varieties of pho in particular.\n\nI may not be a very discerning consumer of this type of food but it all tastes delicious to me. The sauces and broths are good without being too salty and the meats are tender and cooked well for what they are in. We frequently get take out here as a form of comfort food when we're looking for something consistent and fresh. I have some doubts about some of the other reviews as they mention dishes Friends & Pho doesn't even have (Lemongrass Chicken does not exist on the menu and nothing on the menu is that expensive).\n\nThe cleanliness of the restaurant is also excellent--everything is spotless and the decor is nice and relaxing. The staff are some of the most friendly people I've encountered around Ithaca. Give it a try and see how you like it!\n" u"The food was good. The food wasn't bad it definitely will fill the void if you're yearning for Pho.\n" u'$9 lunch buffet was very good. I asked for steamed shrimp and vegetables not on the menu but was pleasantly surprised with how delicious and large the dish was.\n' u'Overall I thought the Pho was pretty good. It had very rich and bold flavors. Despite not loving Vietnamese food I did enjoy the variety of the menu and the integration of chinese dishes into the presentation. What separates this from getting 4 out 5 stars was the average service and atmosphere. Ithaca has a lot of restaurants to chose from and this was below average in comparison to other places.\n' u'The best restaurant in Ithaca if you want some Chinese food. Taste so good!!! People are very nice too. I highly recommend noodle soup with chicken!\nMy girlfriend thinks this is the best local restaurant because she is Chinese. We decide to come here every week.\n' u"It's really the best pho I've ever had! They offer a great portion with a ton of stuff in it( I normally order their pho house special). It's so warming and delicious I go there all the time. I really appreciate the quality pho they prepare. For only $10 you can enjoy a large bowl of heart warming pho.\n" u"I really wanted to like this place. The menu looked really good - lots of vegetarian options. \nWe ordered bean curd with vegetables and a vegetarian pho. \nThe bean curd with vegetables was fine. Nothing too fancy similar to every other bean curd with vegetables I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant. They did include some baby bock choy and 2 varieties of mushrooms which is nice. Though a little steep at $11.\nThe vegetarian Pho was completely flavorless. I believe the just used hot water for the soup base. Another Yelper thought they should use beef stock (NO NO NO!) but I would have expected a vegetable broth at the least. \nThe servers were friendly enough and the restaurant was very tidy. \nThe only other diners in the place seemed unhappy. They don't have a liquor licence but have wine hanging on the wall. I can understand the confusion.\n" u'So I came here with the hubs to try out the Pho because its really close to our place and there\'s no hassle with parking because its in a strip mall. \n\nNow this review has a big caveat everything I write should be followed with "but for Ithaca this is good"\n\nThe Pho is meh but for Ithaca its good. The broth is good the portions are skewed and of course the prices are ridiculously high for what it is. But I\'ve come here twice already for the pho.\n\nChinese takeout is pretty good. Don\'t get me wrong its standard Americanized Chinese take out but the ingredients are of good/great quality. The wonton soup is to die for!!!! Definitely get it in a large size to go. \n\nService is friendly and efficient enough. My only qualm is its so expensive but thats Ithaca...\n' u'Oh what a disappointment!  Really wanted to go to Saigon restaurant but they are closed on Mondays and as there are NO good authentic Mexican restaurants in Ithaca decided to go here... a mistake!\n\nWhen I arrived there were uncleaned tables everywhere and the floor was dirty too.\n\nAfter finding summer rolls on the menu which were OK by the way.  I decided to order the Vegetarian Pho with chicken added; well what arrived is certainly NOT Pho.\nPho is made in a beef broth which this is not.  The broth was watery and bland NO taste what so ever.  Also I got NO sprouts there were a few in my "Pho" but no extra plate.  When I asked for them I was told they only come with the beef Pho\'s.  What B S is that??\n\nI have eaten at Vietnamese restaurants all over the US and this by far was the worse wouldn\'t even call in Vietnamese; and yes if you want to serve a Vegan "Pho" describe it as such on the menu so that people like me who expect a REAL BEEF broth (Which is what PHO is) can order accordingly.\n\nNever again....\n' u"Believe me it's tough to be a pho contender in this town. This is my honest-to-god review of F&P:\n\nOne of the most essential components to a pho is the broth. I ordered the House Special Pho: lackluster. The broth was completely underseasoned. The brisket meat was tough and dry (as if it was cooked beforehand). I've never had dry meat in a pho before. Some pieces of meat even left a metallic after taste. The meatballs were disappointingly the saltiest thing in the mix. There was actually one shrimp that was quite lovely. Either they were skimping on the shrimp or it was a mistake. \n\nAs for the waitstaff they were wonderful nice and attentive. They really made the evening pleasant despite the food.\n\nBUT if you prefer QUANTITY over QUALITY this is the place for you. Go ahead you have been warned.\n" u"Very good. My partner and I both ordered pho; the broth was tasty the noodles had good consistency and the portions were generous. Served in the usual manner with hot and hoisin sauces on the side and a plate of sprouts coriander greens and lime wedges. Service was attentive. Happy to have this new restaurant in our neighborhood.\n\nSomeone in an earlier review mentioned they weren't doing take out yet (as of October) - they certainly do take out now.\n"]
87.Uncle Joe‚Äôs,[u"love the wings Hot sport\nevery ball game too\nespecially when TWC doesn't play it\n" u"Your basic sports bar--go in expecting cheap beer plenty of TVs and nice people and you'll be OK. Don't expect much else.\n\nWe went in on a Saturday to watch a college football game and got some of their beer special at the time which is 22 oz glasses of Yuengling Labatt Blue or Blue Light for $3.50. Not bad. Their web site states they have 12 taps and at least 6 local/craft beers on. This was not accurate as yesterday they had 3 Ithaca beers on tap and the rest were national mass-produced beers. You have to go with what your customers want I suppose but don't advertise on your web site if you don't have it.\n\nThe server was very nice (albeit quite harried when the bar got busy) and there were plenty of TVs around to show different sporting events. They are nice modern TVs for the most part. No problems there.\n\nThe food is pretty awful. We order the Dirty Fries the Uncle Joe's Fries and the Tyler's Nachos to share among six people. All of them came out cold and not very flavorful. Even the one we ordered with spicy sauce was not spicy at all. Biting into cold french fries is never pleasant and it shouldn't happen at McDonald's let alone a place with table service and $6-$8 fries.\n\nIt's worth mentioning again that the servers are nice. But once they are in peak busy times you will not see them much and will spend lots of time with empty beer glasses. They appeared to be understaffed for the number of people there. It took a good 20 minutes to get our check once we were ready to leave.\n" u"I have given Uncle Joe's three chances to blow me away with the wings that everyone kept raving about and the reality of the situation is this: the wings are large and flavorful but if you are looking for any kind of heat you might have to (gasp) go to a Buffalo Wild Wings or even the Anchor Bar in Buffalo. Nothing is hot here and the sauces that are allegedly are hot are not in the slightest. Yes yes I am of Indian descent so I can hardly be objective about heat but there is no sauce at Uncle Joe's that is remotely hot: not the medium or hot sauce or the House Hot Sauce Cajun etc. In fact most of the sauces have random names and are on the sweeter side (Vlad sauce sport sauce etc.). However the real winner here is the overall setup - a townie dive bar in the truest sense of the word and vastly better than most of the other bars in the area. Pool tables a stellar jukebox sweet burgers lots of TVs and a friendly staff. I will return for the other things but not for the wings.\n" u'Food tastes like rancid turds. Terrible service not at all accommodating of any non-normative dietary restrictions. Super rude waitstaff. Looks like a former strip club and/or the location for a Christian youth group. Filled with creepy old men.\n' u"Great location walking distance from Hotel Ithaca. Stopped in Sunday night to catch the late game--looked up reviews before hand and most of them were pretty impressive. \n\nThe bar was full so we sat in the dining room--great views of TV's From anyplace in the bar! \n\nGrabbed a few beers on tap and medium wings. Beer was good--except the Blue Moon could have been colder. Wasn't complain worthy. Wings were awesome as previously reviewed. \n\nTold the waitress that we probably only drinking--our mistake--she only came back when we were nearing the end of our beers so the food order took longer than we would have liked but that was our fault. \n\nMake sure you watch where you place your legs in the booth--they haven't been scrapped for gum in awhile and now my jeans have reminder of my trip!!\n\nRegardless--Good wings beer and football.\n" u"I'm real picky with wings and never write reviews here so that being said try them. By far the best around. Crispy and consistent with the best homemade blue cheese I have ever tasted. Great service too!\n" u"Best wings in town (sorry Nines). We order them medium extra crispy. This is our local pub/restaurant and we eat there often. Lots of parking reasonable prices and good food. It's a sports bar so expect a lot of screens with whatever is in season. And if your game isn't on just ask. Burgers and fries are also good.\n" u'I had high hopes for this place but hated it. For starters they were "out" of the beer I ordered and were "out" of oranges to put in a substitute beer that I ordered. \n\nTo follow they were "out" of mozzarella sticks and (get this one) I was told they were "out" of pizza. I could see being out if an ingredient....but out of pizza? That one didn\'t add up to me.\n\nI ended up getting garlic-parmesan wings and I\'m surprised I didn\'t choke from them being so dry. If I go back I will never again eat what I had before. The wings were gross.\n\nOverall I was disappointed in the service the selection and the food. Thumbs down.\n' u'I went here for the pool and enjoyed it. \n\nThe beer is not delicious though.\n' u"Joe's has everything you need in a sports bar; lots of TVs daily specials friendly bartenders and good bar food. Wings are crispy and their blue cheese is delicious. Try the sport sauce!!\n" u'I have finally found a bar in Ithaca I like.\n\nThis is THE neighborhood place aka not The Commons to watch any sports game on TV.\n\nThis past Sunday we lucked out and scored 2 seats at the bar for the Buffalo game and Buffalo actually won!!\n\nThe service was stellar the prices fair.  The wings were out of this world delicious the best I have ever had anywhere.  Crunchy fat wings and home made blue cheese and yes I licked the container it was off the charts so good.\n\nI cannot wait to return on a lazy Sunday to watch football.\n' u'Best sports bar in town....Joe and his staff make your experience every game like you are at home\n' u"Being Philadelphia Eagles fans on a Sunday in Ithaca NY...our options were limited in finding a decent bar to watch the game.  Under a recommendation from a friend we were able to stumble upon this place.  It's a discreet under the radar bar that is probably bordering on the super-divey.  Frankly that is what I look for in finding a bar.  We got there about an hour before game and were able to find a table by a TV that was designated for the Eagles.  It was one of the smaller TV's unfortunately but we enjoyed ourselves nonetheless. The waitress was attentive and we were never without what we needed for very long.  Once the game started we had ordered a variety of food to munch on during the game.  We got 2 orders of a dozen wings 12 hot and 12 garlic cajun parmesan.  Both wings were not overdone (like some wings are) and both had great flavor.  The garlic parm wings were a dry rub and provided a nice balance from the super hot saucey wings.  The sauce were the hot wings were pretty generously poured over the wings so your mouth was on fire.  We got the nachos which were topped with chicken chili cheese sour cream salsa and jalapenos.  These were the biggest hit of the table and the portion was perfect for 4 of us.  We also got the Uncle Joe's fries which were fries tossed in medium hot sauce.  I love anything in wing sauce so I snacked on these pretty good.\n\nOverall this place is the definition of a dive but that shouldn't be a deterrent.  The place has friendly service surprisingly decent food and a good beer selection.  Great place to watch the game.\n" u"Uncle Joe's has the best wing and burger specials on Mondays and Tuesdays but leaves something to be desired on the beverage and service fronts.\n\nWhen I finally moved to downtown Ithaca I went to Uncle Joe's twice a week on Monday and Tuesday for the wing and burger specials. The wings are really large for being on special. I find other places use wing specials to get rid of the runts but Uncle Joe's seems to hoard them until Mondays. It is only $5.50 a dozen and they are cooked perfectly every time. I usually get the hot Ralph's wings. They are pretty hot but not remorsefully or painfully hot so that sauce is a winner in my book. I have had the garlic parmesan and sweet and spicy wings too but I like mine really hot.\n\nThe burger special on Tuesdays is by far one of the best deals in town for price and quality. All burgers are cooked to order (medium rare thank you)!!! Most places give you well done hockey pucks but these 8ozers are amazing. I have had all the burgers here and they are all delicious. I find myself getting the Uncle Joe's burger more often than not. I love the crisp fresh lettuce tomato and onion that come with most of the burgers. The fries are ALWAYS extra crunchy and crisp. It seems like they don't sit around too long in the back and are served fresh.\n\nI have had the pizza special on Thursday but it is pretty dismal compared to the wing and burger specials. The dough tastes premade and almost biscuity rather than doughy. The sauce and cheese leave something to be desired.\n\nThe walls are covered with TVs and other sports memorabilia. I love watching Yankees' games here and can't wait for the NFL games on Sundays. I sure hope they have the Red Zone channel!\n\nThe biggest contention I have with Uncle Joe's is their beer selection and prices especially during Happy Hour. I'm kind of a beer snob and I don't like lite beer. There are very few choices outside of the mega-brewers. The beers are $2.75 at happy hour. I just don't like paying that much for lite beer at a small local joint like Uncle Joe's. Waaaaa I'm crying I know but good food deserves good beer.\n\nThe service here by the waitresses is almost always slow. I have sat for 5 minutes without menus on a few occasions. Don't expect speedy service on drinks either. A few of the servers were rather robotic in their service without much personality. Service while sitting at the bar is much faster.\n\nI really like Uncle Joe's mostly for the food. If the drink prices and selection and service speed were improved it would be much easier to give an additional star.\n" u"This will be short and to the point: I would say they have the best wings in Ithaca.  Hands down.  $6 pitchers of Yuengling and wing specials on Thursday.  Basically one of my candidates if I had to have a last meal.  I forgot what they were called but the fries with the wing sauce...my wife loved those and she doesn't like wings.  Kudos.  Definitely the meal in Ithaca that I will miss the most.\n" u'The only place in town with this kind of atmosphere. It is the only "home town" bar in the area that has pool tables dart boards lots of TVs and good food all at fair prices. \nI\'m reading all of these reviews about the great wings but I can shamefully say that I haven\'t tried them yet even though we frequent the establishment. Everything else is great though as long as you stay away from the pizza. The buffalo wrap is my go to meal but their burgers are top notch as well. The nacho plate is quite amazing as well; huge portion with lots of chili cheese bacon sour cream.\nThere was a reviewer that thought this place was a "super-dive". It\'s not that person has obviously never been to an actual whole in the wall dive bar before. Uncle Joe\'s is far from a dive and has a very pleasant environment and could even be considered a family restaurant. \n\nAll in all one of kind bar in the area.\n' u'Great deals at Uncle Joes every week night! Tuesday burger special $5... Unfortunately they were out of the veggie burger patty tonight. Delicious fountain soda! Homemade blue cheese dressing yum! Both regular and curly fries rock! Guinness tangy BBQ yes please! Great local spot happy to be here!\n' u'We stopped by here to watch the semi finals of the Rio 2014 World Cup and I was not disappointed. There are 15 or so TV\'s around both big and small. The food was not bad; I liked "Tyler\'s Nachos."\n' u"Uncle Joe's is a great place to grab a burger and a beer and watch whichever game you're into.  This past winter we came here almost every night to watch the Olympics.  They've got plenty of flat screen TVs on nearly every wall so you're bound to find what you're looking for. \n\nThe burgers are awesome and reasonably priced.  The wings are phenomenal....they even make their own blue cheese dressing!  They've also got a couple of pool tables in case you want to do something other than watch TV.  You won't find a lot of college kids here mostly locals which can be a welcome change of pace in this town.\n" u"Went to Uncle Joe's the other night to get a quick beer or two and a dozen wings.  Went to the men's room to wash my hands.  Hand soap dispenser was empty.  Asked the bartender for hand soap and he reported that they were out of hand soap.  I wonder how the cook washes his hands after using the bathroom?  Hmmmmm......I'm not as hungry for wings anymore!  Why wouldn't you just to go the store and buy some Softsoap dispensers in the interim?  Definitely a problem!\n"]
5.Gola Osteria,[u"Seriously delicious. I'm serious.\n\nWhen it comes to delectable Gola is the definition and nothing short of fantastic. The ambiance is cute and cozy quite romantic. The service is on point and we very much enjoyed everything we had.\n\nStarted off with the Potato Gnocchi ala Sorrentina and Grilled Mediterranean Octopus as an appetizer. The octopus was so good we ordered a second. The texture of the gnocchi was so pillowy...so soft. \n\nIt's more fun to share and try everything on the table that's what we did. \n\nIn order of favorites here's the scoop:\n\nPumpkin Ravioli- The black truffle butter complimented the pumpkin well. So flavorful and savory. \n\nWhole Roasted Branzino- came with braised turnips and lemon. The fish was so buttery melt in your mouth I need more can't stop eating more oops there's a pin bone keep eating can't stop. Halp. I still have more food to finish. Ok one more bite.\n\nRoasted Beets- Love love! The beets were sliced thin probably after being roasted drizzled with olive oil sprinkled with rock salt and snips of dill and parsley. So simple yet so good. I'm totally going to recreate this at home.  \n\nLocal Potatoes- omg(arlic)! So much garlic. I loved it! The pecorino was a nice addition. \n\nCrispy Sweetbreads- Perfectly breaded and crispy. Probably some of the best veal sweetbreads I've had. While I'm not a huge fan of fried food the texture complimented the rest of what was on the table. My favorite part about this dish was the black truffle vinaigrette. I found the quantity of onions to be too much and only had a few. Wish there was more polenta. \n\nHouse made focaccia- I loved the texture of the bread and especially the addition of fennel in the olive oil. I didn't want to fill up so fast so only had one small piece. \n\nPappardelle- Now although I've listed it last it's only because something has to be last. The flavors melded together well but left something to be desired. An herb some citrus an acid. The dish could have benefited from another flavor or more depth. The pasta though loved how al dente it was. This dish was really rich if it were mine I wouldn't have been able to finish it.  \n\nWe skipped dessert because nothing on the menu jumped out and after table tetris we were waaaay full. \n\nAfter spending most of the day restaurant hopping I have to say this place is one of the best in Ithaca.\n" u"The journey from the front door to the restaurant is very odd since you're in an apartment building and tenants are just walking around doing laundry while you're all dressed up for a nice restaurant. \n\nThe service is VERY slow so do not expect to come in for a quick meal. Took 30 min for drinks 40 for appetizer 75 for main course and by then we were late for the show we were seeing so didn't even try to stay for dessert. \n\nThe wait staff seemed very oblivious to what each other was doing. A few times drinks were brought to the table but the person didn't know what they had in their hands was called so we didn't know who it was for. Other times the waiter would drop off a new empty glass to eventually fill with wine and a few minutes later someone would come by thinking it is a used glass and take it. \n\nFinally the billing system does not work properly so the original receipt does not accurately reflect the charges to your credit card due to poor wifi connection with the POS system. This led to confusion and more wasted time. \n\nThe food itself was OK but I've certainly had better for the price we paid. The Black Spaghetti was mushy. The cocktails were small. The Octopus was fine but had celery 3 ways and tasted like buffalo type of tomato sauce which I was not expecting for such a refined protein.\n\nGlad we tried this place but I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.\n" u"This certainly is an odd restaurant.  Considering its strange location generally unimpressive food at high prices and neo-collegic Gothic decor (think big heavy oak tables and chairs) I am surprised that it appears to be succeeding. \n\nThe highlight was the wine service.  We appreciated that they provided tastes of the wine to determine if it was something that would be enjoyed.  There were five-six wines available by the glass all around $10 each.  \n\nThe grilled octopus did not have much char.  It came with too much of a creamy dressing with citrus slices (grapefruit) that were too tart.  The octopus just didn't have much flavor. \n\nThe pasta special of beef cheeks in a ravioli like pasta was highly promoted by the server.  The pasta was tough there was hardly any filling and it came smothered in balsamic vinegar which was rather jarring.  The other entree was papparadelle with mushrooms. It was fine but could have used more mushrooms.\n" u"We came for my birthday this year. \n\nFirst things first - the parking and location is a little weird. It's in the building with the fish fountain and you can park anywhere BUT in the garages even if the spaces say resident parking only. We walked around the back to the patio but to go in the front just press the buzzer. \n\nThe food - it was amazing. I had the special with black truffles. It was such a simple dish but something about it make it amazing. And the portion was just right - enough that you could clean your plate without hating yourself afterwards. My boyfriend had the lamb and kept saying that he couldn't decide what was better - the lamb itself or the veggies and yogurt sauce. Both entrees were total winners. \n\nWe also had the arancini appetizer which was hands down the best arancini I've had. They were smaller than usual which made the crispy exterior to soft interior ratio just right. They're made with pork sausage and come with whipped ricotta (OMG) and chili and basil oils. We also finished it up with a dessert - the chocolate semifreddo. Delicious and a perfect end to the meal!\n" u"Try EVERYTHING with at least a group of 4 so that you can share plates - especially the octopus.  In order to get the best experience you really ought to go with all your friends - your chosen family - and family.   It's the only way to eat Italian - family style.   I am sad to see the latest specials and latest menu additions scrolling through the Gola Osteria FB site since I live in New Orleans.  If I lived in Ithaca I would be a Gola Osteria regular. \n\nDATES\nBefore I move on I hope other reviewers continue to bash the secret location of this gem of a restaurant so that my party never has to wait in line.  My own selfishness wants this place to always stay an Ithaca secret like so many of the best lounge spots along the serene gorges in the summer time. (FUCK OFF FRAT BOYS!!!  STOP USING ROIDS & GLASS BOTTLES!!!!)  Some reviewers spend paragraphs detailing the location site when truly all you need to appreciate is the fact that it is a secret.  Who doesn't love secrets.  The sense of fun you have showing a trusted friend a new secret is not only gratifying it strengthens your friendship.  Parking in an unmarked parking lot walking through bland dorm hall ways until you walk through one last door way stepping into Gola Osteria is a unique Ithaca/ Cornell adventure. \n\nTry EVERYTHING with your date - friend date or better half.   For 1st dates PLEASE make sure that they feel safe & know you are taking them to a hidden Italian restaurant and true Ithacan secret so that they don't think you are trying to kill and bury them at a Cornell construction site behind a crane. \n\nService & Wine\nService was on point from the moment we walked in.  The chef-owner paused his task in the kitchen to greet us at the front while the hostess was looking up seating.   Our server did not know the specifics when it came to my wine preference:  A red with no residual sugar no oak and a buttery finish.  Yes that came out of my mouth like a snob.   She consulted with her team and within a short time this exact flavor profile embodied in a reasonably priced bottle of red wine appeared on our table.  Life is good!\n\nMenu\nThe menu is an expression of fine Italian dining with the freshest ingredients sourced from the Fingerlakes area.   Enjoy!\n" u"Amazingly accommodating to vegetarians and vegans. We've traveled extensively in Italy and this place is every bit as good. The antipasto table was exceptional too especially the marinated shiitake mushrooms & onions.\n" u"My husband and I loved this Italian restaurant. Finding it was a little puzzling as the restaurant is located on a small street off of a hill and inside a building that looks like it's also apartments for college students... You'll have to buzz in to get to the restaurant. Apparently it was an old sanitarium converted to restaurant. \n\nThe inside is very warm with original wood furniture kind of Art Deco ish which I love! We were seated on the patio which was very lush with greenery and quite comfortable for a summer evening. \n\nNow for the food: \n\n- grilled octopus: 5. This was grilled perfectly with a solid char and tenderness. Great flavor.\n\n- black spaghetti: 5. (which is actually squid ink - also love this). My husband and I shared this and they brought it out on two separate plates. We couldn't believe that it would have been one serving - it was very generous. The pasta had a perfect al dente. Definitely recommend this.\n\n- branzino: 5. I had the branzino special which was great. The only thing that was a little odd... It came with a large portion of tomato based vegetable stew but the tomato flavor was overwhelming the flavor of the branzino. \n\n- lamb chops: 5. Husband loved his lamb chops - got his medium rare. \n\nOne quirk... We arrived a little early and they have a policy of not seating a party before the reservation time... And there weren't anymore spots at the bar so we awkwardly sat at one of the empty tables.\n" u"This restaurant is located in a Cornell University dorm.\nYou heard me right:  It's in a dorm.  \n\nWent here for a Ithaca U Grad party a couple of weeks ago and sat on the patio overlooking the dorm parking lot and a construction crane and some wooded area.\n\nI did not select it--we were hosted by the proud parents of the graduate. \n\nI am from the Los Angeles/Beverly Hills area but the prices here are comparable to what we pay for a similar meal in my area--one of the most expensive in the United States.  Are Ithaca restaurant lease rates the same as Beverly Hills??\n\nBut let's talk about the food: It is good to very good depending on the dish but not outstanding. But given the prices I would probably not return here.  I did not see the value if I had to pay next time.\n\nService was very good.\n\nHere is a summary of what I ate/tasted at this meal:\n\nSalmon:  4 of 5.  It was fine a bit overbaked but fine.  (Leave the Olives off next time.)\nOctopus:  1 of 5:  You may like it I could barely digest it--had a weird taste.\nTable Bread:  1 of 5: Bland tasteless.  They should be able to do better.\nHomemade Spinach Fettuccine with Red Sauce:P  4.5 of 5.  Loved it.\nArtichoke Appetizer:  3 of 5.  Good nothing special.\nCheese:  3 of 5.  Okay\nService:  4 of 5.  No problems.\n---\n\nJust a side comment on the rest of the menu:  They have pork meatballs and other pork italian dishes.  Why not just use beef?  Where's the beef?  In my area pork is a poor man's substitute for beef served in low end places.   You would insult the owner of a high end classy Italian restaurant if you even asked if there was pork in the meatballs or meatsauce. \n\nThis place may be your cup of tea it really wasn't mine--but again overall we had a great time the graduate loved it and the meal was fine.  I will remember it forever.\n" u'We had a wonderful dinner here on 11/13/16. The service was great and the food was delicious. We had the house made burrata arancini and meatball appetizers and split the black spaghetti entree. I would recommend all of those dishes. We also enjoyed a bottle of the barbera with our meal.\n' u'Are we still in Ithaca toto? Unreal and unknown to the townies. This place had one delicious dish after another. A bit pricey for the volume of food but you can step out from the normal earthy crunchy folk and back into cosmopolitan again...\n' u'We waited over 2 hours for our entrees to arrive and when they did all of our dishes were far too salty. The visit was not worth my time or money.\n' u'I wish I could give it 10 stars. Everything about our experience was perfect. The food is made as well as it is in Italy. I will be going back - and keep coming back. It is romantic cozy amazing service and priced perfectly! The staff is also amazingly accommodating. Definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever been too.\n' u'We come here for all our celebrations easily the best restaurant in Ithaca. We love to come here and share everything. It feel like a special place without being pretentious. \n\nI will say the newest menu is not as good as the fall/winter menu. I really miss some of the starters including the burrata and the arancini. Please bring them back!!\n' u"I would absolutely love to eat at this restaurant if only I could find it.  Apparently it's in a basement of an apartment building somewhere off Rt. 79.\n" u"I will start out by saying this is my new favorite Italian restaurant. I have been to Italy and tasted authentic Italian fare... and this place is the real deal. \n\nWe started off with some fantastic cocktails (bourbon mojitos with black cherries and strawberry gin spritzers). Next we enjoyed some focaccia bread dunked in herbed pressed olive oil. At this point we were getting full but we soildered on! \n\nWe moved on to our arancini (fried stuffed cheesy risotto balls) on a bed of pillowy olive oil and ricotta cheese and grilled octopus with charred vidalia onions mouth watering pickled tomato resting upon a delicious spicy red pea puree. \n\nFor our main courses we enjoyed the squid ink infused black spaghetti with clams and spinach ravioli sun kissed by a light green pesto sauce. Both pasta dishes were cooked al dente and made with love. Please note Gola Osteria makes all of their homemade pastas daily on the premise. Try this place...you won't regret it!!!\n" u"We enjoyed a lovely dinner here for our anniversary on a Thursday night.  They've recaptured the magic of Ithaca dining in the 70's when we met something we've missed since our return.\n\nWe arrived at 6 and most other tables were filled within an hour.  The restaurant was well staffed with well-groomed servers dressed in black shirts and friendly smiles. Service was efficient but not intrusive; flatware was replaced for every course. We started with cocktails a Borracho Limon and a Bellwether 89 both were smooth and not too sweet. The wine list was appealing but we slowly sipped our drinks instead over our meal.\n\nMy wife's Cannelini Bean Bruschetta was wonderful with a grilled smokey crispness that stopped perfectly short of crunch. Unfortunately my lardo was overwhelmed by its honey sauce delicacy defeated by sweet.\n\nThe grilled octopus and mussels were the star dishes of the night. The octopus echoed the slight char of the earlier bruschetta and yet was soft enough to cut with a fork. The mussels were plump and sweet gentler than most I've tasted. We asked for a second spoon to savor the sauce together as if it were a soup.\n\nMy wife liked her gnocci soft pillows on her plate and I my rich black spaghetti but we were too full by then to give these entrees their due attention and could only eat half.  Each was delicious but they had been upstaged by our prior antipasti course. They would solo well as a lighter supper.\n\nLeftovers were quickly wrapped and bagged by our server. The bill for the two of us was 125 more than fair given the quality of our multiple courses and our cocktails. We will go back.\n" u"I received extreme top notch service. We had Sam come to our table late in the evening. We had a couple different wait staff stop by and accede to any request - checking on us a few times in the 2 hours we were there. Very friendly.\n\nThe food was well-prepared and clearly made with pride. I took the advice of many below and got the black spaghetti. Also had a caesar salad - with fresh anchovies - a treat for me. Both were excellent; fresh ingredients; good mix of spicing. Of course had to have dessert as well. Appropriate size. Big enough to be more than a couple bites; not so big that you couldn't or didn't want to finish. The style is Italian but far above and beyond the Olive Garden fare.\n\nI would stress that this place is very hard to find. It is right off State St - but... you don't see a sign outside. Parking is sparse close by. When you get there you need to walk through a sizable section of a former hospital to get to the actual restaurant. For travelers one would think one was in the wrong place. I was lucky and had a couple of locals with me.\n\nCost is reasonable; on the high side - but that's commensurate with the quality of the food and service.\n" u"Beautiful place especially if it's nice and sunny out you want to sit outdoor. Dishes are beautifully presented but way too salty for me and my friend as well. We joked whether the cook accidentally poured the whole bottle of salt in the dishes :D Will definitely go back for the ambience but will ask for significantly less salt next time.\n" u'Extremely disappointed by this place.\nThe service was pretty good but the food was truly bad- burnt or over salted. Lasagna was very hard potatoes were really bad too because of the weird sauce \nThe food that they serve is definitely not Italian. Hope they can improve\n' u"Definitely one of the best restaurants in Ithaca. Perfect place for an impressive date night: the food is delicious cozy and romantic ambiance attentive and helpful service a little hidden. The menu requires a bit of interpretation from the friendly waiters if your Italian is a little rusty but everything our party had was top notch and I can't imagine going wrong with anything on the menu. We started  with the burrata and the grilled octopus as shared appetizers. The burrata is a must have. It's a simple appetizer executed to perfection. Just a ball of fresh burrata on a piece of fried focaccia with olive oil and sea salt but every component is perfect and shines. The burrata was creamy and milky and decadent delivered to your mouth on a crispy piece of fried bread. Just perfect. The octopus appetizer was extremely tender and flavorful. For entr\xe9es I highly recommend the Black Spaghetti with clams which is a must have for garlic lovers like me.\n\nAlso save some room for dessert. The zabaglione was a perfect to top off the meal. I've never had zabaglione before but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's a cup of custard with fresh fruit with the custard being very light treat at the end of a wonderful meal.\n"]
187.J J‚Äôs Cafe,[u'This place is over-rated and a joke.   First of all they are closed during the summer when most people want to sit outdoors at a cafe and enjoy a morning beverage and the weather.  Instead they are open during winter.  Huh?!  Second their coffee is awful.  You would be better off going a little further up the road and going to the Ithaca Coffee house on Triphammer.  Finally the "food" seems to have been brought in from elsewhere and is not particularly appetizing.  It\'s a shame as this area could really use a good coffee house.\n']
196.Arby‚Äôs,[u'The woman who took our order was super friendly and when the fries were taking longer than expected she offered us a free milkshake for our wait. I was impressed by this small gesture and it went a long way in my eyes!\n']
